Magical Research You engage in extensive research, experimenting with any number of magical principles and theories in an attempt to expand your understanding of the Art. You must choose what you are seeking to research, whether a new spell or the formula of a new magic item. The level of the item being researched imposes a modifier to this roll. In order to research a formula, a researcher must be of the level needed to either learn the spell or create the magic item. Each research roll also costs a base amount to even make the roll at all, though this cost can be modified by the result gained.

Reduce the cost of this Research roll by 50% [edit]Rare and Unique Spells The above mechanics assume that the spells being researched are common spells. Rare Spells: If creating a spell that is unique to a character or organization, or simply rarely discovered or heard of, research rolls gain a -20 penalty to the research roll, reducing the penalty by 5 for every spell level the target spell is below the highest the researcher can cast. Unique Spells: Creating a spell entirely from nothing, based entirely on the researcher\u2019s own innovation, is a -30 penalty, reduced by 5 for every spell level the target spell is below the highest the researcher can cast. Additionally, move the time each research roll takes up one step. [edit]Magic Items If the researcher actually has in his or her possession an example of a given magic item, reduce the research time at each roll by one step one week becomes five days one week becomes five days . Success on this roll results in the creation of a schema, or \u201cformula\u201d for creation of that kind of magic item. Schema take up a number of pages, just like spells do, based on their rarity. Common items take up 1d4+1 pages, Uncommon take up 1d4+3, Rare take up 1d4+5, Very Rare take up 1d4+8, and Legendary take up 1d4+9. Learning New Spells \u00b6 A mage gains access to new spells in one of two ways: he can either research them or he can study spells that he finds. Either of these approaches allow him to understand the spell in question. Researching Spells Automatic Research: As mages advance through their levels, they are assumed to constantly be researching, studying, experimenting and discovering or awakening new magical techniques and understandings. These form a body of ongoing \u201cresearch\u201d. At each level, a mage may add 2 new spells to his spellbook. These spells must come from the list of common spells, or from spells whose formulae the wizard has had a chance to read but not copy. There is no cost to scribe these spells. Additional Research: In addition to the normal, ongoing but painstakingly slow research that goes on for most wizards, others also maintain more immediate research projects, as detailed in the Downtime page. Once A Spell is Learned: Once a spell has been successfully researched, it must be immediately scrivened into a spellbook to be prepared. Even if this doesn\u2019t happen immediately, the insights and notes are there: they just have to be set down and codified into something useful. If more than a week passes between successfully researching the spell and writing down, the mage must make an Intelligence check DC 5 + 1 per week that has passed DC 5 + 1 per week that has passed and the amount of time needed to scribe the spell. Failure on this roll results in wasted time, and 1d6gp worth of wasted scrivening materials. Copying A Spell The other way to learn new spells is to copy and already-finished formula, whether one that is written out in another mage\u2019s spellbook or one that has been imbued onto a spell scroll. Another\u2019s Spell Book: Whether a mentor\u2019s spellbook lent for the purpose of copying, or an enemy\u2019s taken as a trophy of war, a mage may copy a spell out of another spellbook. This process takes a number of hours equal to the level of the spell in question. Once this time passes, the mage now knows the spell as though he\u2019d just successfully finished researching it, and can move on to scrivening it in his spellbook. This spell need not be scrivened into the mage\u2019s spellbook. If he continues to have access to the written form of the spell he studied already, he may simply prepare the spell from that book, rather than also add it to his own. This is the reason so many mages collect the spellbooks of their foes and end up with vast libraries: it is expensive to both scribe spells, so it is often easier and cheaper and cheaper to simply keep the other spellbook on hand to learn from. Many mages will consolidate the best of their trophies\u2019 contents into singular traveling spellbooks and the like sometimes. Spell Scroll: Perhaps the easiest of the methods, it literally takes only a single round and no materials in order to divine the formula of a spell from a spell scroll on which it is written. Using this method does consume the spell scroll as though its spell had been cast, however. The downside is that there is no room for lolly-gagging - the mage must immediately scribe it into his spellbook. If even an hour passes between the reading of the scroll and the beginning of the scrivening, the spell is lost. Scrivening New Spells By whatever method is used, once a spell is understood by a mage, he may now copy it into his spellbook. No roll is involved to do so. This takes one hour per level of the spell to be added. Note that if copying another's spellbook, the hours spent experimenting during that process count as time towards this total. Note that if copying another's spellbook, the hours spent experimenting during that process count as time towards this total. This requires the expenditure of 25gp per level of the spell to be added. Once both these requirements have been met, the spell is added to the character\u2019s spellbook. A newly added spell takes up a number of pages in a text equal to 1d4+level of the spell in pages. This is halved if the spell is being scribed into a folio, or doubled if being scribed into an octavo.

The page count modifier for the quarto is 100% i.e. unmodified i.e. unmodified . The so-called \u201ctraveling spellbooks\u201d are octavo in size, measuring 9\u201d x 6\u201d. These can be purchased for 40 gp per 100 pages, with a practical maximum of 200 pages. The page count modifier for the octavo is 200%. Finally, \u201csanctum spellbooks\u201d are larger spellbooks - highly impractical to transport, save as cargo - are called folio sized tomes, measuring 15\u201d x 12\u201d. These sell for 150 gp per 100 pages, and can be bound in books of up to 500 pages. The page count modifier for the folio is 50%. Covers Basic spellbook prices assume simple leather covers, which are rarely \u201chard\u201d leather - they tend to be softer leather covers that often tie shut. Other Leathers: A spellbook covered in \u201cdecorative\u201d leathers such as buckskin, fish scale, shark- or snake-skin or goat- or wyvern-hide are possible for an additional 20gp. Those covered in \u201cfine leather\u201d such as dragonscale, eel- or stingray-skin, behir- or bullette-hide, giant snakeskin or displacer beast- or unicorn-hide are also possible, for an additional 40gp.

Wood Covers: A spellbook covered in \u201cdecorative\u201d woods - such as apple, ash, ebony, hornbeam, oak or many of the more common woods - can be had for an additional 15gp. Covers of rarer woods such as chime oak, laspar, roseneedle pine, shadowtop and similar specimens can be had for 25gp extra. On the other hand, books that are covered in scrap wood often untreated and poorly constructed often untreated and poorly constructed reduce the base price of the spellbook by 5%. Metal Covers: Spellbooks covered in \u201cdecorative\u201d metals such as brass, bronze, copper, iron, silver or steel cost an additional 35gp.

Carvings, Tooling and Other Artwork: This can cost anywhere between 5gp for a simple tooling into leather, carving/burning into wood or etching into metal, all the way to several hundred gold pieces for full cover pieces lovingly wrought by a skilled craftsman. Practical Additions Sealing Cover: Only available on wood or metal covered books, the covers are designed so that when the book is closed, portions extend over the pages and fit together, closing like the lid on a box. The fastener easily closes it well, giving it additional resistance to wear and tear. It is also very easy to fit a lock into the cover. This costs an additional 20gp for octavo, 30gp for quarto and 50gp for folio spellbooks. Key Lock: A lock is set into the cover. If the book does not have the sealing cover addition above above , the other end of the locking mechanism is in a strap of leather which extends from the back cover. When locked in place, it is sealed the leather is quite difficult to cut without damaging the book the leather is quite difficult to cut without damaging the book . The key lock\u2019s price includes the small lock and a pair of keys that unlock it. These locks are priced according to how difficult they are to pick: 25gp for DC 15, 50gp for DC 20, 100gp for DC 25. Puzzle Lock: Like the key lock, except in order to unseal it, the lock requires the solving of a strange puzzle made up of grooves and sliding mechanisms that not only require brain power to solve, but make them nigh unpickable Lock Picking DC is 5 higher than the DC to solve them Lock Picking DC is 5 higher than the DC to solve them . Anyone who is taught the trick for them gains a +5 to their Intelligence checks to open it. Each attempt to open the lock takes 30 minutes or 5 minutes for those who've been taught the lock solution or 5 minutes for those who've been taught the lock solution .

Business Costs The cost to run a business is made up of four things: Owner\u2019s Lifestyle + Employee Costs + Building Costs + Goods Cost Owner\u2019s Lifestyle: A business of a given Lifestyle quality is assumed to cover as part of its expenses the Lifestyle costs of its owner - it is rather part of the point of running a business. Employee Costs: A business must have workers in order to run. Skilled workers cost 2gp per day 60 gp per month 60 gp per month and Unskilled workers cost 2sp per day 6 gp per month 6 gp per month . Building Costs: If the business owner does not own the building in which he operates his business, he must also pay a rent. This is a monthly fee.

Profits: Double the normal profits if a business is a criminal enterprise. Dealing with the Law As a criminal enterprise goes through its business, it attracts the attention of the law. Law Rating: Each neighborhood has a Law Rating, rated 1 - 100. Legal Attention: Each business has a running tally of how much attention it has garnered from the law. On each Running a Business check, add the result of the 1\u2019s die before modifiers before modifiers to the business\u2019s accrued Law Results. Legal Reprisal Check: When a given business\u2019s Legal Attention rating exceeds the Law Rating of the neighborhood in question, it triggers a Legal Reprisal - roll on the chart below. Add the following modifiers to the check, based on the profitability of the business: Poor -20 -20 , Moderate -10 -10 , Comfortable +0 +0 , Wealthy +10 +10 , Aristocratic +20 +20 Reducing Legal Attention Rating: A character may spend active efforts to reduce the amount of legal attention his criminal enterprise is earning by one of two ways: subtlety and bribes. Subtlety: This scaling back the operation, increasing security, and being more subtle. The criminal chooses how much to reduce his Legal Attention rating by, and on his next Running a Business roll, he reduces his die roll by the same amount. Bribes: At any given time, the criminal may enact bribes to the Watch, as long as he has a Contact with the Watch, has Information Network Defense Defense , or has a Secret of knowing who in the Watch to bribe. With this, the criminal may pay a certain amount of gold and roll to reduce the amount of Legal Attention: for every 5gp paid out in bribes, the criminal may reduce the Legal Attention by 1d4. The price of the bribe is subject to a multiplier based on the Quality of the Business: Squalid x.25 x.25 \u2022 Poor x.5 x.5 \u2022 Modest x1 x1 \u2022 Comfortable x2 x2 \u2022 Wealthy x4 x4 Legal Reprisals Roll Result 00-20 None: Rumors trickle about, but the Watch finds nothing worth investigating about you. 21-40 Peaked Interest: Investigations reveal enough to spark interest. Double Legal Attention gains for the next 1d6 checks. 41-55 Active Investigation: The law begins taking a closer look at your affairs. Gain +10 on your next Legal Reprisals check. 56-70 Special Interest: The law is fairly certain it has something worth noting on you. Gain +20 on your next Legal Reprisals roll, and double your Legal Attention gains for 1d6 months. 71-85 Interrogation: You are wanted for questions by the Watch. They begin looking to bring you in. 86-100 Arrests: You are wanted for arrest by the Watch. 100+ Raid!: Your operation is raided by the Watch. Dealing with Rivals As a criminal enterprise grows and is successful, it attracts the envy of enemies and rivals. Each time a criminal business generates a profit, make a Rival Reprisal check. Money Makers: Reduce rolls by -15% for Poor businesses, -5% for Modest businesses, +0% for Comfortable businesses, +10% for Wealthy businesses, and +20% for Aristocratic businesses. Dealing with Rivals Downtime Action Downtime Action : For each day a character deals with rivals, reduce the check by 2%. Leery of the Law: Legal Attention can sometimes cause rivals to step more carefully, reducing Rival Reprisal checks. Establish Information Network \u00b6 \u00b6 Establish Information Network \u00b6 A character may cultivate an information network as a downtime action, deliberately seeking to find those who are either sympathetic or willing to take coin in order to provide the character with information. Networks are rated in size encompassed, from Neighborhood to Regional. Once a network is established at Neighborhood size at Neighborhood size , the character can continue to expand that network. Each stage has a threshold of both time and gold necessary to get it to a given level. When work begins on a network by a PC, the DM should roll to determine what these thresholds are, but not reveal this information to the player. Taking this action, then involves investing both downtime and coin towards these goals, hoping to increase the size and utility of a given network. Small: Your network covers a small village or a single neighborhood in a larger community i.e. the Old Temple neighborhood i.e. the Old Temple neighborhood . Modest: Your network covers a town or a single district within a larger community i.e. the Castle Ward i.e. the Castle Ward . It can also encompass several villages across a wider area. Large: Your network covers the whole of a major city, or several towns and villages across a larger area. \u00b6 \u00b6 Network Size Required Time Required Gold Pieces Small 1d10+10 days 4d6 gp Modest + 1d4 1d4 x10 days + 4d6 4d6 x5 gp Large + 1d4 1d4 x20 days + 1d10 1d10 x20 gp Utilize Information Network Downtime Action Downtime Action \u00b6 Information networks serve a single purpose: to provide a source of information. Acquiring this involves \u201cchasing down\u201d your contacts, setting them to the task of what you\u2019re looking for, and then waiting to see what they bring back to you. This involves a roll on the following table, with the following modifiers: Time: For each day less than a tenday of chasing leads -1% per day less than 10 -1% per day less than 10 Size: Small -10% -10% \u2022 Modest +0% +0% \u2022 Large +10% +10% Coin Spent: Inquiries cost 1d10 gp x.5 for Small, x2 for Large x.5 for Small, x2 for Large . For each gp spent below this, gain -1%. For each gp spent above it, gain +1% max +10% max +10% Specific Info: If you are seeking specific information, there is a chance your network might discover it. This is considered a Secret, but your network takes a modifier based on the scale of the Secret: +10% for Minor Secrets \u2022 +0% for Moderate Secrets \u2022 -10% for Major Secrets Minor Secrets: These secrets are considered embarrassing or personal. They do not endanger either life or social standing, but knowledge of them can be a source of embarrassment. Moderate Secrets: These secrets are considered scandalous or devastating. They do not endanger the life or freedom of the one they are about, but they do threaten his social standing. Major Secrets: These secrets are considered dangerous or illegal. Open knowledge of them could result in danger to the one the secret is about. d100 roll Result Below 20 False Information: Bad information is passed to you, whether deliberately by an upset informant or fed to your network by someone scheming. You gain a Rumor and a Secret, but the Secret is false or incorrect. 21-30 Lost Informants: You do something to lose informants - get them killed, chased from the city, or placed under close scrutiny such that they cannot help you any more. Either way, you lose 2d10 days and 2d10 gp from your Required Time and Required Gold Pieces investments. 31-40 Upset Informants: You do something that causes your informants to become upset with you - embarrassing them, revealing their identities, etc. You lose 1d6 days and 1d6 gp from your Required Time and Required Gold Pieces investments. 41-50 Nothing Useful: You don\u2019t get any real useful information from your informants. 51-65 Scuttlebutt: You gain a Rumor. 66-85 Of Interest: You gain two Rumors. 86+ Secrets: You gain 1d3 Rumors and a Secret. Sow Network Rumors Downtime Action Downtime Action \u00b6 If you have an information network, you can direct them to spread a rumor. This mimics the \u201cSowing Rumors\u201d downtime action, except that the network itself takes the time to spread it, without you having to do anything during that time yourself. This still takes the normal amount of time and cost, but frees you up to do other things. You must simply spend 1 day establishing the rumor with your people. Types of Information Networks \u00b6 \u00b6 Sources of information can be extremely valuable. Entire groups often know things that any given individual might not. The exact nature of the information is usually based on the make-up of the group: street and criminal contacts usually know what\u2019s going on in the shadows, while noble contacts are aware of happenings in the aristocratic sphere. Some kinds of information networks available: Bureaucratic: This category relates to the bureaucratic and judicial operations of the city, from low-level clerks to the doings of the Magistrates and Masked Lords. Criminal: This category relates to the activities of the city\u2019s criminal world, from low-level pickpockets to gangs to fences, usurists, and criminal compacts. Diplomatic: This category relates to the city\u2019s interactions with other nations and city-states, and the governments thereof. Defense: This category relates to both the city Watch and Guard, and to their inner workings as well as what activities and events that concern them at the moment. Mercantile: This category touches on the doing of industry and mercantile life, including information about the Guilds as well. Nightlife: This category covers events at the myriad nightlife locations in the city, from taverns to inns to festhalls, as well as theaters, artistic performances, festivals and similar events. Racial: This category covers information about one of the peoples of the city - dwarves, elves, and other demihumans - who do not make up the majority of the population. Religious: This category covers information about things going on in temples and in religious life in the city in general. Street: This category covers the rough lives of a city\u2019s populace, from beggars and the homeless to those who simply work hard for poor earnings. The Rewards of Information \u00b6 There are two core rewards gained through the use of information networks: secrets and rumors. Secrets: These are core pieces of vital information, as assured as any whispered lore can be. They are usually valuable and immediately useful, either revealing pertinent information of use to one, or at least to someone else which can then be sold which can then be sold . Rumors: Rumors are more common and less assured. They may hint at interesting events, warn of future occurrences, suggest strange goings-on or simply tell of current events that may be manipulated for one\u2019s gain. They are far less reliable, and rumors tend to be worth nothing in coin although it's not uncommon to trade rumors among one's fellows although it's not uncommon to trade rumors among one's fellows .","title":"\u0414\u0435\u044f\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044c \u043c\u0435\u0436\u0434\u0443 \u043f\u0440\u0438\u043a\u043b\u044e\u0447\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f\u043c\u0438"},{"location":"homerules/downtime-activities/#research","text":"Lore Research You seek through tomes of lore and folios of letters, collections of journals and the scribbled notes of sages and scholars for some piece of important lore.

Either of these approaches allow him to understand the spell in question. Researching Spells Automatic Research: As mages advance through their levels, they are assumed to constantly be researching, studying, experimenting and discovering or awakening new magical techniques and understandings. These form a body of ongoing \u201cresearch\u201d. At each level, a mage may add 2 new spells to his spellbook. These spells must come from the list of common spells, or from spells whose formulae the wizard has had a chance to read but not copy. There is no cost to scribe these spells. Additional Research: In addition to the normal, ongoing but painstakingly slow research that goes on for most wizards, others also maintain more immediate research projects, as detailed in the Downtime page. Once A Spell is Learned: Once a spell has been successfully researched, it must be immediately scrivened into a spellbook to be prepared. Even if this doesn\u2019t happen immediately, the insights and notes are there: they just have to be set down and codified into something useful. If more than a week passes between successfully researching the spell and writing down, the mage must make an Intelligence check DC 5 + 1 per week that has passed DC 5 + 1 per week that has passed and the amount of time needed to scribe the spell. Failure on this roll results in wasted time, and 1d6gp worth of wasted scrivening materials. Copying A Spell The other way to learn new spells is to copy and already-finished formula, whether one that is written out in another mage\u2019s spellbook or one that has been imbued onto a spell scroll. Another\u2019s Spell Book: Whether a mentor\u2019s spellbook lent for the purpose of copying, or an enemy\u2019s taken as a trophy of war, a mage may copy a spell out of another spellbook. This process takes a number of hours equal to the level of the spell in question. Once this time passes, the mage now knows the spell as though he\u2019d just successfully finished researching it, and can move on to scrivening it in his spellbook. This spell need not be scrivened into the mage\u2019s spellbook. If he continues to have access to the written form of the spell he studied already, he may simply prepare the spell from that book, rather than also add it to his own. This is the reason so many mages collect the spellbooks of their foes and end up with vast libraries: it is expensive to both scribe spells, so it is often easier and cheaper and cheaper to simply keep the other spellbook on hand to learn from. Many mages will consolidate the best of their trophies\u2019 contents into singular traveling spellbooks and the like sometimes. Spell Scroll: Perhaps the easiest of the methods, it literally takes only a single round and no materials in order to divine the formula of a spell from a spell scroll on which it is written. Using this method does consume the spell scroll as though its spell had been cast, however. The downside is that there is no room for lolly-gagging - the mage must immediately scribe it into his spellbook. If even an hour passes between the reading of the scroll and the beginning of the scrivening, the spell is lost. Scrivening New Spells By whatever method is used, once a spell is understood by a mage, he may now copy it into his spellbook. No roll is involved to do so. This takes one hour per level of the spell to be added. Note that if copying another's spellbook, the hours spent experimenting during that process count as time towards this total. Note that if copying another's spellbook, the hours spent experimenting during that process count as time towards this total. This requires the expenditure of 25gp per level of the spell to be added. Once both these requirements have been met, the spell is added to the character\u2019s spellbook. A newly added spell takes up a number of pages in a text equal to 1d4+level of the spell in pages. This is halved if the spell is being scribed into a folio, or doubled if being scribed into an octavo.

Components: V, S Duration: 10 days A target point within range is the center of a 15\u2019 radius effect for the duration of the spell. Extradimensional travel within this area is completely barred, preventing passage into other planes including the astral and ethereal including the astral and ethereal , all teleportation magics, phasing, and similar abilities. The dimensional lock does not interfere with the movement of creatures already in ethereal or astral forms, nor does it block extradimensional perception. It also does not prevent summoned creatures from returning to their home planes at the end of a summoning spell, but it does prevent creatures from being summoned from other planes within it. Disguise Undead 2 nd level illusion Casting Time: 1 action Range: Touch Components: V, S, M cocoon of a death's head moth cocoon of a death's head moth Duration: 1 hour You make one mindless or willing corporeal undead look different, including clothing, armor, weapons, and equipment. You can make it seem one foot shorter or taller, and anywhere between very thin or very fat. You cannot change the creature\u2019s body type, however: bipedal creatures retain that form. Otherwise, the extent of the change is entirely up to you. This spell can alter how the creature in question smells, as well, allowing even rotting undead to be disguised by it - although the spell does only work in the moment, so that a putrescent undead disguised by it will fool viewers in the moment, but may leave the stench of death in its wake. The changes wrought by the spell fail to hold up to physical inspection. For example, if you use this spell to add a hat to the undead creature, objects pass through the hat, and anyone who touches it would feel only the creature\u2019s true form beneath. To discern that the undead is disguised, a creature can use its action to inspect its appearance and must succeed on an Intelligence Investigation Investigation check against your spell save DC. Dunragarr\u2019s Steelstone 1 st -level transmutation Casting Time: 1 action Range: Touch Duration: 1 hour You touch an item made of steel or iron, and it transforms into a strange amalgamation of stone and steel with a gout of non-damaging non-damaging steam. This can transform items no heavier than 15lbs in weight. This transformation has the following effects: Weapons inflict +1 damage. Armor reduces all damage taken by 1 point to a minimum of 1 to a minimum of 1 . Metal barriers and objects inflict disadvantage to attempts to force, damage or destroy them. At Higher Level: For each additional spell level above 1 st used to cast this spell, add another 15lbs of weight that may be so transformed. Dweomerflow 4 th -level transmutation Casting Time: 1 action Range: Touch Components: V, S Duration: 1 round One of the works of Wyara of Mystra, dweomerflow is a work of meta-magic, creating a field of magic that encompasses another spell and shifts them into or out of a receptacle without permitting the spell to manifest normally. There are two forms of this spell, which the caster chooses to use when the spell is cast. Fill Receptacle: With this version, the spell causes the next spell the target casts to flow from the caster into a prepared receptacle instead of taking its usual effect. Only receptacles innately prepared to accept a spell can be targeted by this effect. These include a focal stone, a magic item into which spells can be stored, or other myriad items, such as crucibles empowered to accept enchantments, certain artifacts, and the like. If the magic item is one that can already accept spells such as a ring of spell storing such as a ring of spell storing , the spell level limit of the item becomes equal to the level at which dweomerflow is cast instead of its normal limits. This function can also be used with effects such as glyph of warding; in that case, the subsequent spell cast is imbued into the glyph as a secondary magical effect that is triggered at the same time as its main effect. Charge Transference: With this version, the caster may alter the charges contained by magic items that use them, such as wands. It functions as the Fill Receptacle effect above, but the spell that is cast into the item must be one of the spells that item can cast, and it regains a number of charges equal to the cost of casting that charge for the item. Alternately, it can be used to siphon charges from one item to another, transferring up to one charge per level of spell slot used in casting dweomerflow. Excess charges are wasted, and an item that is reduced to 0 charges has its normal effect. If one or both of these items are in the possession of an unwilling owner, that owner is permitted an Intelligence save to totally negate the effect. At Higher Levels: When this spell is cast using a spell slot of 5 th or higher, increase the possible spell levels of the effects noted above. Examine the Weft 2 nd -level divination ritual ritual Casting Time: Swift, or Reaction Range: Self Duration: Instantaneous You immediately peruse a spell as it is being cast as a Reaction as a Reaction , is currently in effect if it has no visible effects, you must study it while using detect magic if it has no visible effects, you must study it while using detect magic or that is in written form before you. You tap into the Weave to discern the pattern of that magic, and then fill your mind with its weft. As long as you are able to prepare a spell of that level, you prepare the studied spell; if necessary, you lose a spell you already have prepared in order to make room for the new one. As long as you retain the prepared spell, you may scribe it or cast it as normal. If the spell is too high in level for you to cast, you take 1d6 radiant damage per spell level above your ability from the attempt to read and incorporate something of spell power too great for you to manage. Gods Granted: Any god that can grant the Arcane Domain. Fiery Fists 3 rd -level transmutation Casting Time: 1 bonus action Range: Self Components: V, S, M a lump of coal a lump of coal Duration: 1 minute Your hands burst into flames that emit noxious smoke and shed light as torches.

If your target was a torch, the creature takes 2d6 damage on a failed saving throw. If your target was a campfire up to a 5-foot cube of flame up to a 5-foot cube of flame , the creature takes 2d8 damage on a failed saving throw. At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2 nd level or higher, the target takes an additional die of damage for each slot level above 1 st .

Components: V, S, M a silver bar with 50gp a silver bar with 50gp Duration: Permanent You permanently seal a gate or portal you designate within range as part of the casting. This prevents any activation of the gate or portal, although the gate seal remains as a magical effect around the gate or portal, and is subject to effects such as dispel magic. A knock does not function on a gate seal, though a chime of opening does. Gembolt 3 rd -level evocation Casting Time: 1 action Range: 200 feet Duration: Instantaneous Holding aloft a gemstone, you map tap into the power locked within it, causing it to streak forth in the form of a bolt of energy that shimmers with the same hue as the stone itself, striking a single target in range. This inflicts six dice worth of damage, with the specific die type being based on the quality of the gem: ornamental gems inflict d4s of damage, semiprecious inflict d6s of damage, and precious stones inflict d8s. This does not consume the gemstone, although you may choose to do so in the casting. In such case, the damage is d6s for ornamental stones, d8s for semiprecious and d10s for precious. All that remains of the stone after the casting is simple, inert grey dust of half the volume of the original stone. At Higher Level: For each level of spell above 3 rd used to cast this spell, increase the damage by one additional die. Material Component: A gemstone of ornamental, semiprecious or precious quality. This does not usually consume the stone, but you may choose to have the casting of the spell do so in order to inflict additional damage. Glyph of Revealing 2 nd -level evocation ritual ritual Casting Time: 1 action Range: Touch Duration: 1 hour You write a glyph upon any surface that will retain the ink necessary to cast the spell, even for just a few seconds. When it is complete, the glyph glows for a moment and then sends out a wave of white light 120\u2019 in every direction and then vanishes. When the wave of light touches anything magical, it begins to glow with a white radiance the same brightness as faerie fire. The outlines of magically hidden inscriptions or magical writing of any kind is immediately revealed. This allows them to be read without triggering their effects.

As the magically conductive hailstones fall, they spark with lighting that leaps from stone to stone in a torrent, filling the area with a web of blue-white burning threads and the smell of ozone. Creatures in the area of effect take 6d6 points of lightning and bludgeoning damage and are knocked prone. A Strength save prevents being knocked prone, and reduces the damage to half. At Higher Levels: When this spell is cast using a spell slot of 5 th level or higher, add 1d6 damage to the damage for each spell slot above 4 th .

You gain a +3 AC bonus from the holy star, which swerves to intercept attacks against you. Starbolt. As an action, you may cause the holy star to fire a bolt of searing white-blue stellar fire at a target within 90 feet.

Spell Reflection. As a reaction, you can cause the holy star to reflect back a spell directed at you or that includes you in its area of effect. The holy star may reflect up to six levels worth of spells; as a spell is reflected, the level of that spell is subtracted from the remaining levels worth of spell turning available. When a spell is reflected, its target is simply moved to the originator of the spell - all other effects are as though the original caster were still its caster. If there are not enough levels left to reflect a spell, they may still be expended to instead counter it, as though by a counterspell cast at a level equal to the number of spell levels available. If the last spell level of a holy star\u2019s spell reflection is used, the spell ends early. Gods Granted: Mystra, Azuth Invigorate 1 st -level evocation Casting Time: 1 action Range: Touch Duration: Instantaneous You touch the target of the spell, refreshing it and undoing the effects of weariness. The creature\u2019s Exhaustion Level drops by one.

Irithra\u2019s Spelltouch 2 nd -level enchantment Casting Time: 10 minutes Range: Touch Duration: 1 hour, or until discharged You cast this spell on a non-living item. Another spell is then cast \u201cinto\u201d that item on the subsequent round - you do not have to be the caster of the second. This second spell is then \u201cstored\u201d in the item, awaiting touch by a trigger creature. You determine the trigger creature when you create this spell: it can be race and/or sex, or by \u201ctype\u201d undead, etc undead, etc . When the trigger creature touches the item, the stored spell is unleashed, taking immediate effect as though cast by the one who cast that spell into the item. This second spell cannot be directed i.e., it must work without choosing a specific target i.e., it must work without choosing a specific target , and the item is ground zero for any spell effect. Neither you nor the caster of the second spell can trigger the stored spell, even if you meet the requirements for the trigger. Someone may throw the item to strike a target, making a normal Dexterity attack roll to do so. If the item hits a creature that is its trigger, the magic is unleashed. The spelltouch item radiates magic faintly, and identifying magics never reveal more than the fact that this item has \u201ca single to-be-triggered magic stored by another, underlying enchantment\u201d. If the spelltouched item is shattered or more than half of it is broken away, the stored spell is lost, silently and harmlessly dissipating. This also occurs if the spelltouched item comes within the area of effect of a dispel magic effect, or within 10 feet of any other spelltouched item. Higher Levels: For each spell level beyond 2 nd level this spell is cast at, double the duration so 2 hours at 3rd level, 4 hours at 4th, etc so 2 hours at 3rd level, 4 hours at 4th, etc .

When any part of a ranged magical attack of 3 rd level or lower that inflicts lightning damage passes within 150 feet of the item thus imbued, the attack is diverted away and pulled into the item imbued with lightning rod. If someone is in contact with the item affected by lightning rod, that person receives the full damage of the attack; if the attack normally permits a Dexterity saving throw, it instead becomes a Constitution saving throw that is made at disadvantage. Though nominally a defensive spell used to ground out lightning attacks by an enemy, Rogaster was also fond of using this spell offensively, imbuing an enemy\u2019s breastplate or weapon. At Higher Levels: When this spell is cast using a spell slot of 3 rd level or higher, increase the level of the spell the lightning rod may coopt by two levels for each spell slot level above the 2 nd .

The spell that is sent against the target must be equal to or lower in level than the one it absorbed. Both of these spell selections must be made when the mantle of Mystra is cast.

At any time within the duration, you may cause a number of these stars to race after a target of your choice, deploying either a number equal to your Intelligence bonus as a standard action, or a single star as a bonus action. Targets may make a Dexterity saving throw to resist being struck; success on this save causes the star to also wink out of existence. This save is at disadvantage if the target is attacked with a number of stars equal to or greater than the target\u2019s Dexterity bonus. A living creature struck by one of these stars takes 1 point of poison damage, or 2 points if the creature is undead. Living creatures must also make a Constitution save or become Intoxicated for one minute though at the end of each of their rounds, they may attempt to throw off the remaining effects with another Constitution save though at the end of each of their rounds, they may attempt to throw off the remaining effects with another Constitution save .

While within it, you can see both ends of the portal, although it is murky and indistinct, as viewed through a fog. When the spell ends, you exit the space at either end of the portal, according to your choice. A successful dispel magic or other magic that inhibits the functioning of the portal traps you in the space for the duration of that effect, although creatures within the space may make an Intelligence save at the casting of the spell to be ejected from their choice of portal end to avoid being so trapped. Any effects that destroy the portal ejects all creatures within from a random end of the portal, inflicting 5d6 points of force damage to them; each creature is ejected out of a different end of the portal.

The spell may destroy up to four cubic feet of rock, giving it a maximum damage of 4d4+4 piercing damage, but only if sufficient stone exists to be affected. This spell destroys the structural integrity of the stone in question, and so can do damage to structures, caverns and the like as well.

This creates an area of tranquility surrounding the staff for up to 60 days. All thunder attacks within 300 feet of the staff are made with disadvantage and saving throws against thunder are made with advantage; all creatures within 300 feet of the staff resist thunder damage. The spell ceases to function if the staff is moved before the 30 th day. If the staff is removed after the 30 th day, it functions as a limited staff of thunder and lightning, except it can only produce one thunder or thunderclap effect for each full 10 days that it was in place before the staff loses its potency.

Detect Life 1 st -level divination ritual ritual Casting Time: 1 action Range: Self Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes For the duration, you detect the presence of intelligent, living creatures within 30 feet of you, and such creatures cannot become hidden from you. You can tell if each creature is aware, but not exactly what the life is. It also does not give exact numbers - merely an indication of life and sentience in a general direction relative to the caster. Detect Metals and Minerals 1 st -level divination ritual ritual Casting Time: 1 action Range: Self Components: V, S, M a bit of the material sought a bit of the material sought Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes For the duration, you can sense the presence and location of a single type of ore or mineral deposit within 30 feet of you.

Components: V, S Duration: 10 days A target point within range is the center of a 15\u2019 radius effect for the duration of the spell. Extradimensional travel within this area is completely barred, preventing passage into other planes including the astral and ethereal including the astral and ethereal , all teleportation magics, phasing, and similar abilities. The dimensional lock does not interfere with the movement of creatures already in ethereal or astral forms, nor does it block extradimensional perception. It also does not prevent summoned creatures from returning to their home planes at the end of a summoning spell, but it does prevent creatures from being summoned from other planes within it. Disguise Undead 2 nd level illusion Casting Time: 1 action Range: Touch Components: V, S, M cocoon of a death's head moth cocoon of a death's head moth Duration: 1 hour You make one mindless or willing corporeal undead look different, including clothing, armor, weapons, and equipment. You can make it seem one foot shorter or taller, and anywhere between very thin or very fat. You cannot change the creature\u2019s body type, however: bipedal creatures retain that form. Otherwise, the extent of the change is entirely up to you. This spell can alter how the creature in question smells, as well, allowing even rotting undead to be disguised by it - although the spell does only work in the moment, so that a putrescent undead disguised by it will fool viewers in the moment, but may leave the stench of death in its wake. The changes wrought by the spell fail to hold up to physical inspection. For example, if you use this spell to add a hat to the undead creature, objects pass through the hat, and anyone who touches it would feel only the creature\u2019s true form beneath. To discern that the undead is disguised, a creature can use its action to inspect its appearance and must succeed on an Intelligence Investigation Investigation check against your spell save DC. Dunragarr\u2019s Steelstone 1 st -level transmutation Casting Time: 1 action Range: Touch Duration: 1 hour You touch an item made of steel or iron, and it transforms into a strange amalgamation of stone and steel with a gout of non-damaging non-damaging steam.

Armor reduces all damage taken by 1 point to a minimum of 1 to a minimum of 1 . Metal barriers and objects inflict disadvantage to attempts to force, damage or destroy them. At Higher Level: For each additional spell level above 1 st used to cast this spell, add another 15lbs of weight that may be so transformed. Dweomerflow 4 th -level transmutation Casting Time: 1 action Range: Touch Components: V, S Duration: 1 round One of the works of Wyara of Mystra, dweomerflow is a work of meta-magic, creating a field of magic that encompasses another spell and shifts them into or out of a receptacle without permitting the spell to manifest normally. There are two forms of this spell, which the caster chooses to use when the spell is cast. Fill Receptacle: With this version, the spell causes the next spell the target casts to flow from the caster into a prepared receptacle instead of taking its usual effect. Only receptacles innately prepared to accept a spell can be targeted by this effect. These include a focal stone, a magic item into which spells can be stored, or other myriad items, such as crucibles empowered to accept enchantments, certain artifacts, and the like. If the magic item is one that can already accept spells such as a ring of spell storing such as a ring of spell storing , the spell level limit of the item becomes equal to the level at which dweomerflow is cast instead of its normal limits. This function can also be used with effects such as glyph of warding; in that case, the subsequent spell cast is imbued into the glyph as a secondary magical effect that is triggered at the same time as its main effect. Charge Transference: With this version, the caster may alter the charges contained by magic items that use them, such as wands. It functions as the Fill Receptacle effect above, but the spell that is cast into the item must be one of the spells that item can cast, and it regains a number of charges equal to the cost of casting that charge for the item. Alternately, it can be used to siphon charges from one item to another, transferring up to one charge per level of spell slot used in casting dweomerflow. Excess charges are wasted, and an item that is reduced to 0 charges has its normal effect. If one or both of these items are in the possession of an unwilling owner, that owner is permitted an Intelligence save to totally negate the effect. At Higher Levels: When this spell is cast using a spell slot of 5 th or higher, increase the possible spell levels of the effects noted above. Examine the Weft 2 nd -level divination ritual ritual Casting Time: Swift, or Reaction Range: Self Duration: Instantaneous You immediately peruse a spell as it is being cast as a Reaction as a Reaction , is currently in effect if it has no visible effects, you must study it while using detect magic if it has no visible effects, you must study it while using detect magic or that is in written form before you. You tap into the Weave to discern the pattern of that magic, and then fill your mind with its weft. As long as you are able to prepare a spell of that level, you prepare the studied spell; if necessary, you lose a spell you already have prepared in order to make room for the new one. As long as you retain the prepared spell, you may scribe it or cast it as normal. If the spell is too high in level for you to cast, you take 1d6 radiant damage per spell level above your ability from the attempt to read and incorporate something of spell power too great for you to manage. Gods Granted: Any god that can grant the Arcane Domain.

If your target was a torch, the creature takes 2d6 damage on a failed saving throw. If your target was a campfire up to a 5-foot cube of flame up to a 5-foot cube of flame , the creature takes 2d8 damage on a failed saving throw. At Higher Levels.

This prevents any activation of the gate or portal, although the gate seal remains as a magical effect around the gate or portal, and is subject to effects such as dispel magic. A knock does not function on a gate seal, though a chime of opening does. Gembolt 3 rd -level evocation Casting Time: 1 action Range: 200 feet Duration: Instantaneous Holding aloft a gemstone, you map tap into the power locked within it, causing it to streak forth in the form of a bolt of energy that shimmers with the same hue as the stone itself, striking a single target in range. This inflicts six dice worth of damage, with the specific die type being based on the quality of the gem: ornamental gems inflict d4s of damage, semiprecious inflict d6s of damage, and precious stones inflict d8s. This does not consume the gemstone, although you may choose to do so in the casting. In such case, the damage is d6s for ornamental stones, d8s for semiprecious and d10s for precious. All that remains of the stone after the casting is simple, inert grey dust of half the volume of the original stone. At Higher Level: For each level of spell above 3 rd used to cast this spell, increase the damage by one additional die. Material Component: A gemstone of ornamental, semiprecious or precious quality. This does not usually consume the stone, but you may choose to have the casting of the spell do so in order to inflict additional damage.

When the wave of light touches anything magical, it begins to glow with a white radiance the same brightness as faerie fire. The outlines of magically hidden inscriptions or magical writing of any kind is immediately revealed. This allows them to be read without triggering their effects. Material Components: An ink made of the juiced of crushed eyebright, white chalk and crushed quartz. Gods Granted: Any god that can grant the Knowledge or Logos Domains. Hailcone 4 th -level evocation Casting Time: 1 action Range: x Components: V, S, M pinch of dust and a few drops of water pinch of dust and a few drops of water Duration: x The spellcaster causes large hailstones 2 inches across and greater 2 inches across and greater to rain down in an cylindrical area 30 feet across and 30 feet high. As the magically conductive hailstones fall, they spark with lighting that leaps from stone to stone in a torrent, filling the area with a web of blue-white burning threads and the smell of ozone. Creatures in the area of effect take 6d6 points of lightning and bludgeoning damage and are knocked prone. A Strength save prevents being knocked prone, and reduces the damage to half. At Higher Levels: When this spell is cast using a spell slot of 5 th level or higher, add 1d6 damage to the damage for each spell slot above 4 th .

You gain a +3 AC bonus from the holy star, which swerves to intercept attacks against you. Starbolt.

Spell Reflection. As a reaction, you can cause the holy star to reflect back a spell directed at you or that includes you in its area of effect. The holy star may reflect up to six levels worth of spells; as a spell is reflected, the level of that spell is subtracted from the remaining levels worth of spell turning available. When a spell is reflected, its target is simply moved to the originator of the spell - all other effects are as though the original caster were still its caster. If there are not enough levels left to reflect a spell, they may still be expended to instead counter it, as though by a counterspell cast at a level equal to the number of spell levels available. If the last spell level of a holy star\u2019s spell reflection is used, the spell ends early. Gods Granted: Mystra, Azuth Invigorate 1 st -level evocation Casting Time: 1 action Range: Touch Duration: Instantaneous You touch the target of the spell, refreshing it and undoing the effects of weariness. The creature\u2019s Exhaustion Level drops by one.

Irithra\u2019s Spelltouch 2 nd -level enchantment Casting Time: 10 minutes Range: Touch Duration: 1 hour, or until discharged You cast this spell on a non-living item. Another spell is then cast \u201cinto\u201d that item on the subsequent round - you do not have to be the caster of the second. This second spell is then \u201cstored\u201d in the item, awaiting touch by a trigger creature. You determine the trigger creature when you create this spell: it can be race and/or sex, or by \u201ctype\u201d undead, etc undead, etc . When the trigger creature touches the item, the stored spell is unleashed, taking immediate effect as though cast by the one who cast that spell into the item. This second spell cannot be directed i.e., it must work without choosing a specific target i.e., it must work without choosing a specific target , and the item is ground zero for any spell effect. Neither you nor the caster of the second spell can trigger the stored spell, even if you meet the requirements for the trigger. Someone may throw the item to strike a target, making a normal Dexterity attack roll to do so. If the item hits a creature that is its trigger, the magic is unleashed. The spelltouch item radiates magic faintly, and identifying magics never reveal more than the fact that this item has \u201ca single to-be-triggered magic stored by another, underlying enchantment\u201d. If the spelltouched item is shattered or more than half of it is broken away, the stored spell is lost, silently and harmlessly dissipating. This also occurs if the spelltouched item comes within the area of effect of a dispel magic effect, or within 10 feet of any other spelltouched item. Higher Levels: For each spell level beyond 2 nd level this spell is cast at, double the duration so 2 hours at 3rd level, 4 hours at 4th, etc so 2 hours at 3rd level, 4 hours at 4th, etc .

When any part of a ranged magical attack of 3 rd level or lower that inflicts lightning damage passes within 150 feet of the item thus imbued, the attack is diverted away and pulled into the item imbued with lightning rod. If someone is in contact with the item affected by lightning rod, that person receives the full damage of the attack; if the attack normally permits a Dexterity saving throw, it instead becomes a Constitution saving throw that is made at disadvantage. Though nominally a defensive spell used to ground out lightning attacks by an enemy, Rogaster was also fond of using this spell offensively, imbuing an enemy\u2019s breastplate or weapon. At Higher Levels: When this spell is cast using a spell slot of 3 rd level or higher, increase the level of the spell the lightning rod may coopt by two levels for each spell slot level above the 2 nd . Thus, a 3 rd level spell slot may ground out up to a 5 th level spell, a 4 th level spell slot may ground out up to a 7 th level spell, and a 5 th level spell slot may ground out up to a 9 th level spell.

If such a creature is used as a mount, it acts independetly and can also attack as one of it\u2019s actions, as stated in the official rules. Intelligent creatures are independent creatures. Indeed there can be communication between the creature and it\u2019s master, however the creatures acts independently and thus have a turn of their own. This applies to also to riden mounts. These creatures are controlled by the DM. {% hint style=\u201dinfo\u201d %} NOTE: The only exception for this rule is the mount from the Find Steed spell. Due to the nature of the spell, that mount is controlled by the PC. Whether intelligent or not, each creature is still a beast at heart. It might disagree with the rider going in a certain direction such as jumping great heights. The DM might ask the PC to make a particular check whether to remain mounted or maybe the creature just runs off. Intelligent creatures might challange their master more then non-intelligent creatures, especially when the mount is being asked to do something that might hard for it, it considers dangerous or maybe something that it fears. Death of a Mount or Companion \u00b6 Mounts roll for death saves. A dead mount can be resurrected if the requirements for a ressuraction spell are met. This applies also the companion creatures. Potions Potions and other consumables work as intended even on mounts. But so do the harmful effects of negative potions and poisons. Owned Stable Creatures in Sessions \u00b6 As your character is represented by a character sheet so are animal companions. Whenever you purchase a mount a character sheet is provided to you by the stable keeper DM. If you acquire a mount by different means then you should discuss it with the stable keeper DM and a character sheet will be drawn for your mount. During a session the player has to control the mount\u2019s token the same way he does with his own PC. Any action that the mount does also has to be stated by the PC. The DM will treat the mount as if it was another PC. This is required for companion creatures as well. Companion Needs \u00b6 Just like a normal PC, mounts and pets have basic needs. They need: Food and Water to survive Rest after a long day To breathe Someone to take care of them Food and Water is either brought along before the adventure started or else it can be scavanged while in session. Most of the time it will be easy for the mount to be sustained while on an adventure, however some enviroments such as deserts or frozen landscapes such as deserts or frozen landscapes will make it very hard and might possibly starve your mount. Normal exhaustion rules apply if a mount is not sustained. Food and Water Needs Creature Size Food per Day Water per Day Tiny \u00bc pound \u00bc gallon Small 1 pound 1 gallon Medium 1 pound 1 gallon Large 4 pounds 4 gallons Huge 16 pounds 16 gallons Gargantuan 64 pounds 64 gallons Official Ruling from the D&D Player\u2019s Handbook 5e Resting after a long day is a big must if you want your mount to remain healthy. They will suffer normal exhaustion effects if they fail to rest or are being pushed over the limit. Breathing is a rather obvious need. Depending on the nature of the mount, different mounts can breathe in different enviroments and cannot in others. Sometime a PCs has to leave his mount behind if the mount cannot breathe in a certain enviroment he wants to explore. This takes us to the following need. Someone to take care of the mount is needed, especially if the mount is not Intelligent. As discussed before, most of the time the PC has to provide nurishment for his mount. If in danger, the PC needs to protect his mount. Most mounts cannot really fend of for themselves but are a very valuable asset when guided by someone. All of the above applies also for companion creatures. In town, adventurer owned mounts and beasts can be left at the stables were all their needs will be looked after. Stables are discussed in the next chapter. Riding a mount with no saddle \u00b6 No saddle while mounting means that both the beast and the rider and uncomforable. The rider does not have anything that supports him on his mount. Any check done by the PC to remain mounted is done at a disadvantage. Any attack preformed by the PC will be at a disadvantage. While in combat, the rider has to perform a check to remain mounted if the mount moves and the rider does any other action other then try keep steady Combat Mechanics \u00b6 In this section we are going to discuss the combat mechanics of a mounted PC and his mount. Mount Actions in Combat \u00b6 A non-intelligent mount can take three different types of actions in combat, while an intelligent one can also attack. Dash. \u00b6 A mount can take this action to move twice his normal movement speed. Disengage. \u00b6 When disengaging a mount can move without triggering attacks of opportunity. Homebrew Homebrew The rider will still provoke an attack of opportunity.* Dodge. \u00b6 The mount can take the dodge action as normal PC or NPCs can. However, only creatures attacking the mount itself will get disadvantage on attack rolls and only the mount will get advantage on Dexterity saving throws. The rider is not affected. Area of Effect on Mounted Creatures \u00b6 When a mounted PC and his mount are inside the Area of Effect of a spell or effect, the rider can be affected too. If HALF the squares that make up the mount\u2019s token are inside the are of effect, and that effect affects in a 3D spectrum not only the ground not only the ground , then both rider and mount are effected. Ranged Attacks while Mounted \u00b6 Riders doing ranged attacks while mounted will have disadvantage on the attack roll. This also applies to both ranged weapon attacks and ranged spell attacks. Animal Handling \u00b6 Animal handling is a vital skill when it comes to mounts. A rider needs to be good with animals if it wants to ride one. If a character does not have proficiency in Animal Handling, all rolls related to keeping control of the mount and related will be at a flat DISADVANTAGE, no matter all the other roll modifiers. You still get the \u00b1 modifier related to Animal Handling. Note: A mount summoned by SUMMON STEED does not require proficiency in animal handling since the nature of the spell. Keeping Control of the Mount \u00b6 At the start of every turn, a mounted creature has to succeed a DC 10 Animal Handling check. This check is straight forward. If the character has proficiency in Animal Handling then he rolls with advantage. If the character does not have Animal Handling, he rolls with disadvantage. If he fails the Animal Handling check then he must succeed DC 10 Dexterity saving throw modifiers from saddle's apply modifiers from saddle's apply otherwise he will be knocked prone 5ft away from the mount and take 1d6 bludgeoning damage. The mount will dash as far as possible away from it\u2019s rider. That will be the end of the rider\u2019s turn. If the rider succeeds the Dexterity saving throw, he will land on his feet 5ft next to the mount. He will still have his turn, but the mount will still be spooked off. Melee Reach \u00b6 Mounted combat adds a 3 Dimenstional element to combat. Every creature has his own height.

History: The people of Savona are usually stereotyped as hedonistic ne\u2019er-do-wells, concerned with nothing more than enjoying life to its fullest.

Due to this, a number of schools teach the art of dueling to supply the city with sufficient swordsmen for hire to bring satisfaction to the aggrieved.

Once an item\u2019s rune slots are full, any attempt to inscribe another rune on the item without first clearing one of its slots will cause the item to tear itself apart. Inscribing Runes Inscribing a rune is time-consuming, expensive and dangerous. Such a task requires the specialized training and experience of a runesmith who spend decades learning and perfecting their craft. Due to the challenging nature of their studies, runesmiths often demand rare materials, help with a difficult task or promises of future favors, in addition to the materials costs of the rune. In order to inscribe a rune, a runesmith must be of an appropriate character level and spend an amount of money and time as indicated on the chart below. If you are inscribing a blessed rune, you must dedicate the rune to a deity that you worship. Magic items \u00b6 Knowledge scrolls Knowledge scrolls are commonly produced by spellcasters to record what they have learned and teach the reader the proper mental state, body position, hand motions, and any material components necessary to cast a spell. To learn a spell from a knowledge scroll, the spell must be of a level that you have spell slots. The spell must also be one that could normally be on your spell list. For example, you cannot learn an arcane spell from the Elder Tradition if you are a human cleric, nor can you learn a val\u2019Borda secret spell if you are a val\u2019Inares. After 1 hour spent studying the scroll, make an ability check. The ability you use depends on the Arcanum of the spell. If the spell is divine, you must make a Intelligence (Religion) skill check; if it is an arcane spell you must make an Intelligence (Arcana) skill check. In either case, the DC is equal to 15 + the spell\u2019s level. If you succeed, the spell is added to your spell list. If you prepare spells, you can now select the spell you learned as one of your prepared spells. If you have a separate list of spells known, you can choose one of the spells you know and replace it with the spell you learned. You can also replace one of the spells you know with the spell you just learned when you gain a level in your spellcasting class, like normal. If you fail, you do not learn the spell. Regardless of whether the check succeeds or fails, the scroll is destroyed in the process. Spell Scrolls Spell scrolls allows anyone, even someone without the ability to wield the Arcanum, to cast the spell inscribed upon it without providing any material components. Casting the spell by reading the scroll requires the spell\u2019s normal casting time. Once the spell is cast, the scroll crumbles to dust. If the casting is interrupted, the scroll is not lost. If your proficiency bonus does not equal or exceed the minimum proficiency bonus show in the Spell Scroll table, you must succeed on an ability check to determine whether you can successfully channel the magic of the scroll. If the spell is divine, you must make an Intelligence (Religion) ability check. If it is an arcane spell you must make an Intelligence (Arcana) ability check. In either case, the DC is equal to 10 + the spell\u2019s level. If you succeed, you successfully cast the spell. If you fail, you speak meaningless words of power and nothing happens. Regardless of whether the check succeeds or fails, the scroll is destroyed in the process. The level of the spell on the scroll determines the spell\u2019s saving throw DC and attack bonus as well as the spell\u2019s rarity, as shown in the Spell Scroll table.

Trained sorcerers and priests scoff at such items as foolish superstition or the work of charlatans, but those that believe know better and pay trusted shamans, witchdoctors and undir dacoi for these gifts. For additional fetishes see Forged in Magic: Reforged. Animal Fetishes The most common fetish created by shamans across Arcanis, animal fetishes are made by infusing the power of primal animal spirits into an item. These fetishes must be worn openly on your person, not concealed in a pouch or pocket, in order to gain their benefits. Boar Fetish Wondrous item (fetish), common Description: This fetish is made from a pair of boar tusks held together by rawhide straps and decorated with fur strands holding colored beads. Abilities/Effects: Wearing this fetish grants you advantage on death saving throws. If you ever roll a 1 on a death saving throw, you can call on the power of this fetish to succeed on that saving throw. The fetish then crumbles into dust. Dolphin Fetish Wondrous item (fetish), uncommon Description: This colorful bracelet consists of shells and beads, tethered to a strap of rawhide stained with the dried blood of a dolphin. Regardless of its age or conditions, the bracelet always smells of brine. Abilities/Effects: Wearing this fetish grants you a +2 bonus on Strength (Athletics) checks to swim. You can call on the power of this fetish to cast water breathing once, without expending a spell slot or requiring components. The fetish then crumbles into dust. Serpent Fetish Wondrous item (fetish), rare Description: This fetish consists of thin strips of snake skin wrapped around the crowns of snake fangs, binding them to a strip of rawhide. It is commonly made in the form of a bracelet, anklet, or necklace. Abilities/Effects: Wearing this fetish grants you advantage on all saves to resist the poisoned condition. When you take poison damage or gain the poisoned condition you may, as a reaction, call on the power of this fetish to end the condition and gain resistance to poison damage for 1 hour. The fetish then crumbles to dust. Monster Fetishes These fetishes are rarer than animal fetishes as the talisman requires some portion of the creature to draws forth it\u2019s power. These fetishes must be worn openly on your person, not concealed in a pouch or pocket, to gain their benefits. You must wear a monster fetish for a full day before you receive its benefit. Ssanu Fetish Wondrous item (fetish), very rare Description: This headdress consists of the upper half of an adult ssanu skull, bleached white and inscribed with runes. Due to the components required, these fetishes are incredibly rare. Abilities/Effects: Wearing this fetish grants you the ability to cast detect magic as a ritual. You can also cast arcane sight* (DC 15) once, without expending a spell slot or providing components. Once you do so, you cannot use the fetish in this way until you complete a long rest. Additionally, while wearing this fetish you can speak the Ssethric and Ss\u2019ressen languages as if you were a ssethric creature. Bloodbeak Hummingbird Fetish Wondrous item (fetish), uncommon Description: This fetish consists of several bloodbeak hummingbird feathers set into a bone clasp. It is commonly worn as a hair clasp. Abilities/Effects: If you fall while wearing this fetish, you may, as a reaction, call upon the power of this fetish to slow your descent. Your rate of descent slows to 60 feet per round. When you land, you take no damage from falling and you land on your feet. The fetish then crumbles into dust. WHY RUNES? With so many magical items, why runes? Runes grant both players and game masters a way to customize items within a structured rules format. Beyond that, they help alleviate one of the oldest issues in most roleplaying games: discarding one magical item for a better one, regardless of the weapon\u2019s history or significance. When characters find \u201cbetter\u201d items, they are suddenly seeking a buyer for their less potent items By adding a rune to a non-magical suit of armor or weapon of personal or historical significance, a character can create a useful magical item without sacrificing a roleplaying hook. Picking up your father\u2019s blade to hunt down his assassins is more appealing, when the blade has a rune or two to make it a magical sword, rather than just a sharp hunk of metal. No one is certain who developed the techniques for inscribing runes, but evidence shows that they were used by the Eladru cyclops as well as the ssethrics of Yahssremore. Scholars debate how humanity learned this craft. The dominant theory is that they were taught by the elorii before the Great Betrayal, or perhaps gifted humans learned to duplicate the power of eloran enchantments through sheer determination. Dwarven runesmiths all agree that their ancestors, the celestial giants, had mastered the craft, though there is no consensus as to when they appeared upon Arcanis. Runic magic is a complex merging of magical ritual and exacting craftsmanship in order to produce magical reservoirs that capture and direct energy into desired patterns. Few have the patience and devotion required to become a runesmith as mastering these techniques is a long, difficult, and sometimes deadly process. Each rune is an individual work of art, a pattern carefully inscribed into an item and then imbued with magical energy. Runes are visually distinct by type and craftsman, and individual runesmiths can be easily identified by their designs. Runes GFFeCtS & uses Runes are inscribed on non-magical items to grant them magical properties. Each rune\u2019s effect depends upon the type of item the rune is inscribed upon. A fire rune on a weapon allows you to envelop the weapon in flames, while that same rune placed upon on a suit of armor grants you a measure of protection against fire damage. With few exceptions, runes may only be inscribed upon mundane items such as spellcasting foci, weapons, shields, or suits of armor. While there are other enchanted items which may take advantage of runes or have space for additional runes, these are exceedingly rare. Rune Quality and Slots Runes come in a variety of rarities, from uncommon all the way to legendary. Very rare and legendary runes require the wielder to be attuned to the item bearing the rune in order to gain their full potential. If the wielder is not attuned to the item, it is treated as having the effects of an uncommon rune of that type (if one exists). Magic is the power of creation, and just as the strain of its use takes its toll upon a spellcaster, it also takes its toll upon the various inanimate materials it infuses. Since magical energy is not woven into the item during its creation but instead added later, inscribing a rune creates a great deal of tension within the item. Any one mundane item has 3 rune slots, each of which can hold a single uncommon rune. Inscribing a rune onto an item fills one these slots. Runes at higher rarity take up more slots since they must have larger and more intricate patterns in order to hold more magical energy. Runesmiths have rituals and techniques they can use to remove runes from an item, emptying a rune slot and preparing the item to receive another rune. Once an item\u2019s rune slots are full, any attempt to inscribe another rune on the item without first clearing one of its slots will cause the item to tear itself apart. Inscribing Runes Inscribing a rune is time-consuming, expensive and dangerous. Such a task requires the specialized training and experience of a runesmith who spend decades learning and perfecting their craft. Due to the challenging nature of their studies, runesmiths often demand rare materials, help with a difficult task or promises of future favors, in addition to the materials costs of the rune. In order to inscribe a rune, a runesmith must be of an appropriate character level and spend an amount of money and time as indicated on the chart below. If you are inscribing a blessed rune, you must dedicate the rune to a deity that you worship. Runes Effects & Uses Runes are inscribed on non-magical items to grant them magical properties. Each rune\u2019s effect depends upon the type of item the rune is inscribed upon. A fire rune on a weapon allows you to envelop the weapon in flames, while that same rune placed upon on a suit of armor grants you a measure of protection against fire damage. With few exceptions, runes may only be inscribed upon mundane items such as spellcasting foci, weapons, shields, or suits of armor. While there are other enchanted items which may take advantage of runes or have space for additional runes, these are exceedingly rare.

Runesmiths have Rune Types RUNE RARITY CHARACTER LEVEL INSCRIBING COST TIME RUNE SLOTS Uncommon 1 st or higher 1,000 gp 1 week 1 Rare 5 th or higher 3,000 gp 2 weeks 2 Very Rare 10 th or higher 5,000 gp 3 weeks 2 Legendary 3 SPECIALIZED TECHNIQUES Amalgamated Base cost of both runes +50% time for both runes +0 Blessed Base cost +25% + 3 days +0 Entwined Base cost +75% +1 week +0 Amalgamated Runes \u00b6 As runes (attunement required) Description: This technique allows the runesmith to create a specialized rune that allows the wielder access the powers of one of the two runes that make up an amalgamated rune, with but a moment\u2019s concentration. The technique required to inscribe an amalgamated rune are known only by a select few, making the cost of such an inscription quite costly. Abilities/Effects: An amalgamated rune entwines two runes into one, allowing you to switch to either rune\u2019s properties as a bonus action. Thus, you may have an amalgamated fire/air rune and switch between one benefit or the other. The runes that form the amalgamated rune must be of the same quality and each may only be of uncommon or rare quality. An item may only hold one amalgamated rune. You must attune to an item bearing an amalgamated rune in order to use the rune\u2019s properties. Blessed Runes \u00b6 As runes (attunement required) Description: These runes are frequently used by religious institutions for use by their priests and holy champions.Accessing the powers of a blessed runes is as much a test of faith as of skill and power. Abilities/Effects: Blessed runes work in all ways like standard runes except that they are dedicated to a particular deity. Regardless of rarity, you must attune to an item bearing a blessed rune and in order to attune to the item you must worship the same deity the rune is dedicated to. If multiple blessed runes are inscribed on the same item, they must all be dedicated to the same deity. Entwined Runes \u00b6 Description: Dariac, a young apprentice of Elebac of Solanos Mor, accidentally rediscovered the techniques required to access a rune\u2019s full range of abilities. Abilities/Effects: These specialized runes allow a wielder to access two of the rune\u2019s effects, switching between them as a bonus action. For example, if you wield a sword with an entwined fire rune you are able to access both the rune\u2019s weapon and spellcasting focus abilities, while that same rune upon armor also grants access to the rune\u2019s weapon ability, allowing you to empower your unarmed strikes. An item can only have one entwined rune inscribed on it. You must attune to an item bearing an entwined rune in order to use the rune\u2019s properties. The knowledge of crafting legendary runes was lost with the fall of the Imperium of Man and only those recovered from ruins and moldering crypts can be transcribed and then, by only the most skilled runesmiths. Some believe that elder elorii retain the knowledge necessary to create new legendary runes, though zealot Sarishans argue that these powerful runes come directly from His divine inspiration. If you wish to use legendary runes in your campaign, they should not be for sale in the village blacksmith shop. They should be found only among the truly wealthy or in the most ancient of fortresses. They should be given as special rewards to only higher level player characters. These items should be given out in much the same context as legendary magic items, and have powers consistent with very rare to legendary items. Like rare and very rare runes, only a single legendary rune may be inscribed in a single item, lest the item simply combust due to the immense magical forces trapped within it. Rune Stacking \u00b6 Each rune creates its own unique pattern that cannot operate when combined with duplicates. If the same rune is inscribed on a single item multiple times, only the most powerful version of that rune is active even if there are other forms of that rune inscribed on the item. This limitation also applies to effects that have limited number of uses. Those limits are accessed per item, not per rune, thus inscribing multiple copies of a rune onto an item will not allow you to bypass that limitation. Several runes sheath the object in some form of energy (fire, frost, electricity, etc). An item may be sheathed in only one form of energy at a time; activating another such rune will just change the kind of energy surrounding the item. Rune Formulas \u00b6 Much like magic items, runes require formulas for creation. A rune\u2019s formula describes the intricate and delicate process of inscribing the specific pattern of the symbol on the item as well as the ritual required to enchant the rune with magical energy. A runesmith collects many formulas over time, and providing a runesmith with a formula they don\u2019t have is a sure way to get into their good graces. Since each rune comes in different rarities, the formula for creating a rune creates a specific rarity of that rune. A formula to create a thunder rune (uncommon) is different than one for creating a thunder rune (rare). Likewise, the formula for creating amalgamated, blessed and entwined runes is different than the formulas to create the usual versions of the runes in question. So a formula for a blessed necrotic rune (uncommon) is different than a formula for ad entwined necrotic rune (uncommon). No formulas exist for legendary runes; it is thought that the skill needed to create such things has vanished. Creating a rune\u2019s formula is the pinnacle of a runesmith\u2019s art since it captures the unique combination of artistic and magical skill required to inscribe a rune in a way that others can reproduce, if they are skilled enough to understand the formula. In order to create the formula for a rune, a runesmith must have an example of the rune in question and spend twice the amount of gold and time it would cost to inscribe the rune. The rune that provided the basis of the formula is destroyed during this process, along with the item it is inscribed upon. Learning Runes \u00b6 During their long training, runesmiths study over the formulas in their master\u2019s collection and dedicate themselves to mastering the craft of inscribing runes. By committing the intricacies of a rune\u2019s formula to memory, eventually a runesmith can learn how to inscribe that rune. Learning a rune in this way takes three times the normal amount of gold and time needed to inscribe it. During this time, the runesmith makes many attempts at creating the physical pattern of the rune and learning the ritual necessary to capture magical energy within its design. Erasing Runes \u00b6 As part of their training, apprentice runesmiths are often called upon to erase a rune from an item, in preparation for a new one being inscribed. Erasing a rune takes the same amount of time it would to inscribe the rune. This is the best way to learn a rune; while unraveling its pattern and carefully releasing the stored magical energy, a runesmith can learn how to create the rune again. As the last step in erasing a rune, the runesmith must make an Intelligence (Arcana) check, with a DC determined by the rarity of the rune, as show in the table below. On a success, the rune is erased from the item, leaving an empty rune slot, and the runesmith has learned how to inscribe that rune. On a failure, the rune is erased but the runesmith wasn\u2019t able to grasp the intricacies of how it was inscribed. RUNE RARITY INTELLIGENCE (ARCANA) DC Uncommon 15 Rare 17 Very Rare 20 Legendary 23 Amalgamated +2 Blessed +1 Entwined +3 TRANSFERRING RUNES Most of the time, if you bring a runesmith an item bearing a rune they don\u2019t know they will be happy for the opportunity to learn it and then inscribe it for you at significant discount, if not for free. This process takes a great deal of time and there is always the risk that in the process of erasing the new rune, the runesmith will fail to fully understand it. Runesmiths have created this spell as a solution, allowing them to transfer a rune from one item to another but losing the chance to learn the rune in question. The usual cost for transferring a rune is half of what it would cost to transcribe it but some runesmiths will charge more if they are asked to transfer a rune they do not know. Some runesmiths may even refuse such a request. Rune Descriptions Air Rune, uncommon/rare/very rare Description: Items etched with this rune seem to manipulate the air around them.

Finally, after an oath of loyalty is made, the blade is bestowed and the champion is given a holy quest to fulfil. Should the champion ultimately fail in completing their quest, their life is forfeit as the blade fills them with necrotic energy, killing them and trapping their soul with the sword itself. Abilities/Effects: You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magical sword; all damage dealt by this weapon is both slashing and necrotic. Every time you reduce a target to 0 hit points with this weapon you gain ldlO temporary hit points, which remain for 1 minute before they fade away. To become attuned to one of these blades you must swear a Sarishan oath of loyalty to the Church of the Dark Triumvirate. The attunement process for this weapon also includes a holy quest that the wielder must accomplish. Should the wielder either violate their oath or fail in completing their quest, the weapon will flood their body with necrotic energy, dealing necrotic damage equal to twice their hit point maximum. This damage bypasses all resistances and immunities. If this effect kills the wielder, their soul is trapped within the weapon. A soul trapped in this fashion is unable to pass on to the afterlife but can telepathically communicate with whoever becomes attuned to the weapon next. If the trapped soul can convince a wielder of the weapon to complete their failed quest. If this happens, the trapped soul is immediately released to the afterlife. If there is a soul trapped in the weapon when another wielder fails in their quest, the trapped soul is utterly destroyed and the soul of the most recent wielder becomes trapped in the weapon. Capharran War Glaive Weapon (glaive), rare (requires attunement) Description: The haft of this weapon is solid oak, polished to a golden sheen. The blade is forged from magically hardened silver etched with fine silver tracery. History: These war glaives are crafted for the honor guard of Capharran nobility, and are retained by these guards after their retirement. After generations, some have found their way through inheritance, gift, or seizure, throughout the League of Princes. Each is individually named, and the history of these glaives is highly honored by their bearers. Many claim the most ancient glaives were crafted in the Sky Kingdoms, but others doubt this, pointing out that the first recorded glaive was crafted by Naphthala val\u2019Sungha, personal bodyguard to the Prince of Capharra in the third century. The consensus of most scholars is that Naphthala created the first of these items, though the Kio vehemently disagree. Abilities/Effects: You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. Additionally, while wielding this glaive, you may spend your reaction when attacked in melee to grant yourself or an adjacent ally a +2 bonus to AC against the triggering attack.

Culdari \u201cFinal Repose\u201d Weapon (war scythe), legendary (requires attunement by a follower of Neroth) Description: Culdari, called \u201cFinal Repose\u201d, is the holy scythe said to have been once employed by the Valinor, the Hand of Neroth. This legendary weapon appears to be a jet\u00acblack scythe, made of a wood never seen upon the surface of Arcanis. The entire haft is etched in hymns to Neroth, the symbols making serpentine patterns along its length. Pure silver was used to fill each symbol, creating a stark contrast to the dark handle. The top of the haft is mounted with a large skull and from its open mouth projects the silvery-steel scythe blade. History: With the fall of the Imperium of Man, the god Illiir feared for the His children. He looked about and found the Celestial Giants waging a losing battle against the True Dragons and their wyrms. Illiir struck a deal with these giants saying, \u201cWatch over my people, be unto them as protectors and guardians, and I shall save your people\u201d Desperate, the giants agreed and with the bargain struck and the Valinor, the servants of the Gods, took to the skies once more. Titanic battles raged across the continent, with the less powerful wyrms falling quickly to the valinoric host. But the wyrms had numbers on their side, as well as the devastating power of the True Dragons of Arcanis. In the end, the Valinor had to combine their powers, slaying a few of these forces of nature while only able to bind the most powerful of these Dragons into a dreamless slumber. Their own hosts decimated, the Valinor looked across the continent and saw that one last True Dragon remained; its name was Luqun\u2019qun\u2019ovn, and it fell to the Hand of Neroth to face the beast alone. The titanic battle leveled mountains and changed the course of mighty rivers, with neither gaining the advantage. Finally, suffering horrific wounds from Culdari\u2019s long blade, Luqun\u2019qun\u2019ovn fell from the sky. The Hand of Neroth was so in awe of the Dragon, that decided to grant the beast the God of the Dead\u2019s blessing and make the undead Dragon its steed. Unfortunately for the Valinor, it made the mistake of thinking the creature cowed by its defeat. Upon its resurrection, the Dragon swallowed the Valinor whole, entrapping it within its belly before taking flight upon tattered wings. The surviving Valinor arrived in time to see their brother, the Hand of Neroth, reaching for them through the Dragon\u2019s ribcage that now served as his prison, pleading for help. But the Host was too battered and weakened to pursue and battle the now Undead Dragon. Shaken by the loss, the winged angels took flight, leaving the scythe, Culdari forgotten and unclaimed on the battlefield. Abilities/Effects: You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic scythe. It has the following additional properties.

The item can communicate telepathic ally with and knows all the languages of whomever is attuned to it. Personality: Culdari was once wielded by the Hand of Neroth; it does not suffer fools lightly. It is imperious and demanding but also dedicated to its purpose \u2014 protecting humanity. It is convinced that the best way to do this is to destroy ever dragon, including such draconic entities as Jeggal Sag and The Fire Dragon. Culdari tends to forget that most mortals cannot withstand such challenges. It is a stern taskmaster but it does have the best interests of humanity at heart A conflict will occur if a dwarf, giant, ssethric, or ss\u2019ressen attempts to attune with Culdari. Also, taking actions that would jeopardize humanity as a whole will prompt a conflict between the weapon and its wielder. See Chapter Nine for the rules and properties of a war scythe.

Despair Weapon (war scythe), very rare (requires attunement by an undead creature or worshiper of Neroth) Description: This profane weapon was crafted by the Lich- Lord Hegrish val\u2019Mordane of Sohbuk from the bones of priests from the Mother Church of Coryan. History: Few creatures have shaped the history of Canceri like Hegrish val\u2019Mordane, the longest serving Dark Apostate in Cancerese history thanks to his\u2003 undead nature. During the Heretic Wars, some murmured that a Dark Apostate who sat on his throne while others fought for him was a weakling, speaking with fondness of Arthmoor val\u2019Virdan\u2019s famous death on the front lines. In response Hegrish unveiled Despair, crafted through his own knowledge of arcane arts and calculated to make him appear as Neroth himself on the battlefield, where he reaped the lives of many Milandisians.

Devil King\u2019s Lash Weapon (whip), legendary (requires attunement) Description: This is a long black whip that at first glance appears to be made from tightly braided strips of black leather. Closer inspection reveals the leather to be roughly textured, even scaled, which seems to writhe and recoil under the touch of mortals. Woven into the braided strips are hooks and barbs, fashioned from human bone fragments and designed to flay the flesh from the living with each stroke. At the base of the whip\u2019s blood-stained handle is a human skull. While anyone can wield this weapon, its true powers are only evident to its real masters, those whose blood courses with the taint of Infernal blood. History: During the Time of Terror the mankind was pitted against foul hordes from the Abyss. Hundreds of thousands died during that time as the bloody conflict raged across the Known Lands. The blood of the innocent paid for the eventual decimation of the endless invading forces of Infernals and their generals, each armed with terrible artifacts from their blasted Realm. One such item is the horrid fiery whips used by the Devil Kings to drive forward the Abyssal ranks. Some were taken as trophies of war, while most were confiscated and destroyed by the priests that accompanied the mortal host, assuring that such relics would not corrupt future generations. Sadly, not all were accounted for and these lashes keep turning up in the hands of madmen and butchers. Abilities/Effects: You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.

Duelists\u2019 Surprise Weapon (Any melee weapon), uncommon (no bonus), rare (+1) Description: A favorite among hot-headed young nobles, and other miscreants of a more dubious nature, this miniature blade, complete with kidskin leather grip, is a mere two inches long, but with a flick of the wrist becomes a full-size sword. History: The first of these weapons was created not by a duelist, but by an assassin during the Shadowed Age. Fin Raghnaid might be no more than a legend, but it is said that he visited the fractured ourts of warlords and petty despots, entangling himself in their intrigues and, when necessary, producing a sword from what appeared to be thin air to slay a rival. A limited number of these swords were crafted through the ages, but it was not until the great dueling schools of Savona were founded that they became popular. No longer a weapon of assassins, those dueling schools with a reputation for deadliness over honor popularized these items, and now they can be found in wide variety. Abilities/Effects: All duelists\u2019 surprise weapons are magic weapons, but only the rare variety grants a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls.

Soon she could best any canton in physical combat, and with their support she sought entry into the Tralian Knights. She was rejected due to her height alone. Undaunted, she asked that they grant her combat to prove herself. They set her against their mightiest knight to teach her a lesson. She brought him to the ground with a single blow.

To stave ofl^ disaster without compromising their faith, the Emerald Scales crafted new magical items for their egg clutch, including the first tail bracers. When next they entered battle, these new items allowed them to dominate the enemies of Ssethregore, and made the nagas take notice. Already leery of exterminating the Emerald Scales, the nagas also wanted tail bracers for their other ss\u2019ressen warriors. As more clutches devoted themselves to the Varn, the naga allowed them access to the new weapons as well. When the Black Talons left the Ssethregoran Empire they took several tail bracers with them, making them now common in both the Kraldjur Morass and the Sulfur Marsh. Abilities/Effects: You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.

History: Kihuk-Mak was a dark-kin of black reputation beyond the Godswall, where he served as an agent of Uhxbractit\u2019s dictatorship. Enemies of the state were slaughtered by his flail, crafted for him by Uhxbractit\u2019s own forge master. The weapon drank deeply from the blood of the innocent, until one rebel from Bastion unleashed the Word of Xabal in his dying moments. Kihuk-Mak\u2019s compatriots were destroyed, and Kihuk-Mak fell near death. When he recovered, the purity he had felt shook him to his core.

This group was warred upon almost to extinction by the priestesses of Saluwe and the val\u2019Dellenov family. The death of so many of his order, as well as being prohibited to practice their faith so enraged Kanutus that he vowed vengeance on the Mother Church and the val\u2019Dellenovs. The Myrantians played on his hatred, coaxing Kanutus to craft forestbane, making copies for him and the few remaining druids and embark on a personal war of vengeance against the pristine glades of the empire. For a year Kanutus and his band ravaged the land, evading agents of the val\u2019Dellenovs, and destroying many sacred groves in the process.

For centuries, however, no truly great warhammers had been made, beyond the standard magical enchantments any human smith could duplicate. That changed with the return of the Sword of the Heavens and the rise of master smith Berenike of Nol Dappa. As the Erdukeens were experiencing a renewed passion for their history, so Berenike experienced a renewed passion for hers. Already a talented master smith, she was determined to create a warhammer to equal the legendary weapons of old.

Centuries would pass before it was once again seen, again in the hands of a gar, as these bestial men waged war against the Imperium of Man. In modern times, the chieftain of the marauding Gar Tiche, whose wanderings have them raiding towns and caravans from the western edge of the Corlathian Mountains to the shores of the Lauriol Sea, has been seen wielding a weapon matching Heart\u2019s Fang\u2019s description. This tale contradicts the infamous Ig of the Many Tongues, who claims that heart\u2019s fang is in the hands of a very dangerous warlord of the Gar Dahl, the People of Iron, in far off Quagga. The blade is said to remember every betrayal and sworn enemy of the gar tribes and the spirit within vows to take vengeance upon every member of that race, until they are no more. The spirit demands that blade be heated white hot and then quenched, over and over again, in the hearts of a score of the race it has sworn to destroy This, along with the stories of others possessing Heart\u2019s Fang, lead scholars to conclude that there must be more than one copy of the blade. Ig of the Many Tongues agrees. He believes that while each gar tribe may have made copies of their own, the original Heart\u2019s Fang, the one wielded by the extinct Gar Ormal chieftain, is the one held by the Gar Dahl warlord, for it is covered in sigils and said to hunger for the blood of all that have hunted the gar over the ages.

Infernal Harvest KELISAR, \u201cSERPENT EATER\u201d Kelisar, \u201cSerpent Eater\u201d \u25a0\u25a0 Weapon (longsword), legendary (requires attunement by an elorii) Description: Kelisar is an elegant single-edged longsword. The blade has a series of runes etched upon it. The golden hilt wraps elegantly around the wielder\u2019s hand forming an intricate basket portraying a mongoose attacking a serpent. Kelisar\u2019s pommel is adorned with a flawless emerald of the deepest green, its perfect balance is apparent to anyone lucky enough to hold this magnificent sword in their hands. History: Kelisar or serpent eater in the Eloran language, is an ancient elorii blade forged by Auros, the legendary elorii warrior that slew the ssanu archmage Ss\u2019koreth. After the elorii overthrew their scaled overlords, the elorii craftsman Ferelas, affixed its distinctive hilt to the blade. Kelisar hung in a place of honor in Belestor, removed only in times of great need, such as the various Ssethric incursions occurring every few centuries. Kelisar was last used in battle against humans during the Great Betrayal, where the reborn hero Auros used it to wound a Valinor. It is not known if the famed blade was taken with retreating elorii forces or if it fell into the hands of their human foes. Abilities/Effects: You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage when attacking with this magical weapon.

Lance of the Errant Knight Weapon (lance), rare Description: Crafted from wood gathered in the Faerdwalden, these lances are often carved with mythical creatures, such as unicorn, or other horned animals, such as the narwhal. History: The woodsmen of the Faerdwalden have made intricately carved lances since before the founding of the Milandisian League, but it was during the reign of Oswald val\u2019Inares, the Usurper, that these works of art became all the rage in the court of Naeraanth. Oswald II granted an enchanted lance carved with a unicorn to Ermingild Traudottir, a knight sworn to his service whom he favored. Ermingild secretly loathed the line of the Usurper, but was bound by her duty to the king. She served Oswald II until the end, then exiled herself in penance and wandered the land as a knight errant. As the Faerdwalden lances, seen as symbols of the Usurper\u2019s reign, fell out of style at court, her noble actions brought them a different reputation, and many knights errant now seek out similarly enchanted lances to follow in her footsteps. Abilities/Effects: You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magical lance; this bonus increases to +2 when you are directly protecting the defenseless. Additionally, any time you are engaged in mounted combat this weapon grants you and your mount a +1 bonus to AC. Lantas Dalo: Cleaver of Trolls Weapon (longsword, unique), very rare (requires attunement) Description: Lantas Dalo appears to be the perfect longsword with a heavy, over weighted tip to smash through the rocky carapace of Singarthan Trolls. The handle is carved from straight-grained ironwood and the pommel capped with a replica of a gauntleted fist. Dwarven runes cover the blade; retelling the tale of the troll invasion of Solanos Mor, while a multitude of small diamonds encrust the hilt causing the hilt to sparkle in the light. History: Lantas Dalo was forged a century ago by Master Smith Elebac of Solanos Mor. At the time of its forging, the city fell under siege by a horde of Singarthan Trolls that swept down out of the Corlathian Mountains and into the numerous tunnels that riddle that mountain range. The siege lasted for one hundred days until the valiant defenders of the City of Shameful Penance finally drove off or destroyed the troll host, but not before suffering heavy casualties. Master Elebac soon learned that his eldest son had fallen in the battle. Heartbroken, Elebac swore vengeance and returned to the unfinished sword in his forge with unbridled determination and fury. When the blade neared completion, Elebac had the city guard bring a live troll before him. This Singarthan Troll was the warlord Thragris, captured on the field of battle and imprisoned before his broken body could recover. As the last hammer blow rang upon the blade, Thragris was set free and Elebac turned to face the unfettered Troll lord. \u201cMy vengeance begins at the source!\u201d shouted Elebac as he waded into battle, the sword\u2019s blade still glowing red-hot. Thragris never stood a chance. Afterwards, Elebac pulled the now cool sword from the ruined body of the troll and looked upon the finished blade. He raised the sword above his head and, in a soft voice, christened the new blade Lantas Dalo, the Cleaver of Trolls. Elebac then strode across the cavern to his eldest daughter, Betra, and presented the sword to her hilt first. \u201cDuty binds me here to continue my craft, but take up this sword my daughter, and avenge your brother and all the others who fell to these beasts,\u201d said Elebac. And with that, Elebac strode back to his forge to continue perfecting his craft, while Betra girded for war and left Solanos Mor on her own crusade.

Lion of Winter Weapon (longsword, unique), legendary (requires attunement by the head of the val\u2019Tensen family) Description: This longsword\u2019s blade is ice blue, as if made of solidified cold, with an elegant pattern etched along the flat side. The elaborate cross guard is fashioned to resemble a lion\u2019s head, complete < with fur to simulate its mane. History: This longsword has been in the hands of the val\u2019Thnsen family since the days of the Imperium of Man. But since the sundering of the val\u2019Tensen line after the secession of Milandir from the Coryani Empire, the sword has made its displeasure known by killing anyone attempting to take the blade from its scabbard who was not the rightful leader of that family. The governor of the Coryani province of Ulfila, Augustos Titus val\u2019Thnsen, determined to humiliate his separatist cousins by wielding the blade and thus proving that they were no longer a part of the family had his blood freeze in his veins upon taking the sword from its sheath. Emboldened, the newly crowned Duke\u2003 of Moratavia took possession of the sword and suffered the same fate when he attempted to wield the sword. Fearful that none were now worthy of claiming the sword, it was given to the monastic Order of the Blade, where it will remain until the true head of the family comes forth to claim it.

Mastbreaker Weapon (bardiche), rare (requires attunement) Description: This gruesome bardiche has been pieced together using the masts and metalwork from the first ship the pirate captain Yacobin Bike plundered. History: Most pirates from the Pirate Isles refrain from preying on each other, but not so Yacobin Bike. He was a boy when his crew was betrayed to the Coryani by fellow pirates. Yacobin escaped execution and swore all the world would be his target, particularly fellow pirates. He stole his first ship, then stole a better one. The first time he plundered a fellow pirate he ripped apart the mast and metalwork of her ship, and reforged them into a bardiche. Now he is a legend to be feared. His swift ship draws near under cover of darkness or fog, and then Yacobin himself swims silently aboard. With mastbreaker he cripples the ship, leaving it vulnerable as his first mate pilots Yacobin\u2019s vessel to attack. He takes no prisoners, sinking ships with all hands after he has plundered the cargo. Abilities/Effects: You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.

Moon Blade Weapon (longsword), very rare (requires attunement by a val\u2019Dellenov) Description: This curved blade, meant to represent the crescent moon, shimmers and glows like a moonbeam. History: The val\u2019Dellenov family, being scions of the goddess Saluwe, feel a deep connection to nature and the beasts that roam the land. Many can tap into the power of their heritage, calling forth many aspects of animals to aid them. When learning to use their abilities, they are taught to always retain control, but a few are unable to resist the dark lure of giving into the more savage side of nature and revel unabashedly in it. One of the most infamous killers in the empire was Luciana Titus val\u2019Dellenov, a woman who allowed the primal urges of the wild to overwhelm her, hunting down her fellow man as a wolf hunts prey. She was eventually captured and tried by the Mother Church for heresy, after which she was promptly burnt alive. Various random acts of murder and mayhem soon followed, which were blamed on rampaging humanoid wolves that turned back into normal humans at first light. Many point to Luciana\u2019s death curse as the root of this lycanthropic scourge. Altherian scholars scoff at the idea that lycanthropy is a curse that can be spread through bites from the infected, and believe instead this is a blood curse aimed at those who witnessed Luciana\u2019s death, which was passed down to their descendants. If they are correct, then there may be many thousands of potential victims, as the execution was conducted just outside the walls of Grand Coryan, with many thousands in attendance. Others believe that the blood curse is perpetuated by a secretive group known as the Conclave of the Claw that believes that unleashing the beast within all of us is the true representation of Saluwe\u2019s will. Seeing this as a stain upon their family honor, the val\u2019Dellenov train members of the family to be hunt down those afflicted by this curse, just as they pursue other shapechangers, such as the wererats that infest cities. Due to the inherent dangers involved in the slaying a shapechanger, these hunters are issued a moon blade. Within the Golden Boughs of Saluwe is a shrine to a little known aspect of Saluwe, the Lady of Moonlight. Here, Saluwean priestesses enact a ritual consecrating a blade on the first night that Viridis, the green moon, is full. The owner of the blade stands vigil throughout the night, which culminates when the blade is immersed in a hallowed reflecting pool as it catches the last of the moon\u2019s glow. Retrieving it from the cool waters, the blade shimmers with the glow of a moonbeam, feeling almost weightless in the owner\u2019s grasp.\u2003 Abilities/Effects: You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon, which increases to +2 when fighting shapechangers. Furthermore, the blade shimmers a pale green whenever any shapechanger, regardless of form, approaches within 60 feet. Any shapechanger that is successfully struck with this weapon must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or be forced to revert to their original form and be unable to shift form until the next dawn. Finally, the blade can cause the tracks of shapechangers to shimmer with a pale moon-lit glow. This grants you advantage on Wisdom (Survival) checks made to track shapechangers. Screaming Sword Weapon (longsword), legendary (requires attunement) Description: The actual appearance of a screaming sword varies greatly; however, all incorporate a jagged piece of crystal. The type and color of the crystal depends on where the wailing stone was discovered. For example, green and blue crystals are common throughout the Corlathian Mountains, but Thandras, Givahi val\u2019Ishi\u2019s personal blade, was fashioned from a blood-red crystal. Regardless of the crystal used, these blades are magically hardened and sharpened to preserve their cutting edge. The design of the hilt is chosen by the creator, although most incorporate some type of geometric design that follows the shape of the bound crystal. History: In the days immediately following the curse that turned Celestial Giants to the dwarves, they found that most souls passed on to oblivion when they died, though a few became trapped in crystal deposits near the enclaves where the dwarves gathered. Val psions later discovered that these stones, charged with the energy of dwarven souls, could be tapped to power psionic items, though doing so released the soul within. Givahi val\u2019Ishi of Enpebyn, a brilliant val artificer found a way of permanently sealing the energy within the stones. Givahi further refined this sealing technique to allow him to infuse his own power within the crystal alongside the soul energy, creating the first screaming sword in 123 I.C. The techniques developed by Givahi vaFIshi spread quickly among the val, to the point where the dwarves demanded that all such stones be turned over to them, so that they could be given a place of rest within the Chamber of Final Repose, leading to one of the few modern conflicts between the Solani dwarves and the Coryani Empire. All dwarves bear a great hatred towards anyone seen wielding one of these blades. Abilities/Effects: You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. When you attack psionically awakened creatures or creatures whose natural attacks deal psionic damage, this bonus increases to +3. Also, whenever you make an attack using this weapon, all sentient creatures within 20 feet can telepathically \u201chear\u201d the weapon moaning, muttering, and screaming in their minds; these noises do not cause any benefits or penalties, but most creatures find them unsettling and disturbing. Psiscream: A screaming sword has 3 charges. While holding the weapon, as a bonus action you may expend 1 charge to force each creature in a 15-foot radius to make a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 2d8 psychic damage and is pushed 10 feet away from you. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and is not pushed. This sword regains 1 charge daily at dawn. Sea Rover Weapon (scimitar), rare (requires attunement) Description: This scimitar is crafted of Milandisian steel and has a crescent guard inlaid with mother-of-pearl and coral. Its hilt is wrapped in sharkskin to give it a strong grip, while the end of the pommel is set with a pure aquamarine gemstone. History: Though many who craft this weapon in Savona and the League of Princes do not know its history, those in Naeraanth tell of Merireiks val\u2019Ossan, the wild centurion who had as many disciplinary actions as he had awards of honor, who once wrestled a shark bare-handed, and who crafted Sea Rover with a Savonan artificer on a drunken dare. He was sent with the legions to quell the Eppion rebellion, and while stationed in Metra he fell in love with an Undir who shared his interest in artificing and the sea, and who learned the falchion\u2019s secret. When the legion left Metra she declined to go with him, and after many more campaigns, Merireiks finally retired to Naeraanth. The original Sea Rover is still used by the Dolphin Guard. Abilities/Effects: You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. While holding this falchion, you may stand on and move across any liquid surface as if it were solid ground (when crossing molten lava or some other dangerous surface, you can still take damage from heat or fumes).\u2003 Shadow Mother Weapon (longsword), legendary (requires attunement) Description: This black longsword is unique in the fact that its matte black finish seems to drink up all light around it. The material does not rust or tarnish, and always appears to be the deepest possible black. The blade itself is forged with deep fullers carved into the blade to drain the blood of its victims. History: Osvaldus Ephrem had one goal in life: Power. He falsely joined the temple of Cadic to gain access to the Shadowstone, rumored to be a crystalized Valinor of the dark god. He stole the Shadowstone and crafted a sword to steal the essence of the Valinor and bind it to his own soul. But the Shadowstone was not a Valinor of Cadic. It was not a Valinor at all. It was an artifact of death beyond Osvaldus\u2019s ability to control. That was when the Cadician assassins struck, putting down Osvaldus\u2019s heresy, but not before he had finished his creation. They took Shadow Mother for further study, but the cursed blade overwhelmed the wielder, who slew several of his brethren before escaping. Abilities/Effects: You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. When you hit with an attack using this weapon the target takes an additional ldlO necrotic damage with the wielder of the weapon suffering half of the necrotic damage dealt to the target. Curse: This weapon is cursed, a fact that is revealed only when an identify spell is cast on the sword or you attune to it. Once attuned up, you feel a constant desire to use this weapon to kill others and must succeed at a DC 10+1 per character level Charisma saving throw to use any other weapon while you are bearing this weapon. To drop or stop being attuned to this weapon requires a DC 20 Charisma saving throw, with a failed save preventing the wielder from dropping the weapon and triggering a Rage per the Barbarian class ability. Should the wielder of this weapon ever be reduced to 0 hit points or lower, their soul is pulled from their body into the blade. While in this form, the soul is still in control of the body\u2014 which is not considered to be an undead\u2014but separate from it. Without the soul present in the body, it is now has resistance to healing effects, only being healed for half the amount rolled. While in this form, the body does not require food or drink, as the energy of the sword keeps it sustained. While in this form, whenever shadow mother deals necrotic damage to a target, the wielder\u2019s body is healed the full amount of the necrotic damage dealt. If the wielder of this blade does not kill another creature before midnight every day, the body of the wielder has its hit point maximum reduced by 5 as the magical connection to their body withers away. For each 5 hit points drained from the body, it begins to look increasingly skeletal until it looks little more than a desiccated mummy. At this point, should the body ever be reduced to 0 hit points by any means, the wielder is permanently killed and the soul is forever trapped in the sword. Sickle Sword of the Myrantian Lord Weapon (khopesh), legendary (requires attunement) Description: The lapis-lazuli inlayed into the ivory hilt of this sickle is stained by the blood of the countless creatures slain by this hungry blade. Slightly tarnished and notched, the iron blade of this khopesh is still sharp. History: This sword was created not by a Myrantian, but by Blasius Toranestus, Coryani governor of the province of Toranesta. He styled himself as one of the Phaerons of old, and commissioned Caecus val\u2019Abebi, a Coryani artificer, to fashion him a weapon reminiscent of the royal khopesh held by the ruler of ancient Myrantis. Blasius\u2019s love of all things Myrantian did not extend to its people, and his oppressed provincials eventually slew him with his own sickle sword. The sword was later stolen from Coryani custody and delivered anonymously to the new governor of Toranesta, still stained with Blasius\u2019s blood. Each future Coryani governor found a similar khopesh delivered to them, as a warning, and a similar weapon is now held by the Phaeron of the Abessian Dominion. Abilities/Effects: You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. Any time you reduce a creature to 0 hit points with this weapon, the target is instantly killed. Additionally, when you roll a 20 on an attack roll made with this weapon, you may force the target to make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or fall dead. Once used, this ability cannot be used again until the next dawn.

History: Two elorii Laerestri were spying on several Ymandrake agents when they were captured and forced unto one of the Black Ships bound for the Isle of Tears. Fortunately, a Milandisian naval captain, Nevis val\u2019Ossan, rescued them while leading an attack that resulted in sending the Ymandrakes into Yarris\u2019s cold grasp, one of the few victories the Milandisians scored against the Black Fleet.

History: Spell spinner was discovered in the ruins under the First City by the Warrior Sage Vinas val\u2019Mehan of the Emerald Society. Vinas was able to successfully date the blade\u2019s design back to the beginning of Imperium of Man, but the weapon\u2019s powers remained largely a mystery to him until the expedition crossed paths with an ancient undead horror while returning to the surface. During the battle, the creature unleashed a series of destructive spells, one fired directly at Vinas\u2019 chest. Reflexively, he raised the blade to block the blow, and, to everyone\u2019s amazement, deflected the eldritch bolt back, destroying the creature. From that point forth, the blade became a fixture at his side, but upon his death, Vinas ordered the blade be given to the Emperor of Coryan as a gift. The messenger and the blade never made it to Grand Coryan however, and Spell Spinner has been lost ever since.

Granting this sword to their greatest warrior, the Fiurrianites made war upon the Other. After the betrayal of Osalian, however, the spirit within the sword went wild, and sought to slay all humans surrounding it.

Furthermore, Wrath will not harm an unarmed opponent (individuals who possess the Martial Arts class feature or something similar are considered to be armed for these purposes); it merely passes through such individuals without leaving a mark. If you are val\u2019Emman, you may use an action to speed your attacks allowing you to can make one attack with this weapon as a bonus action on each of your turns for 1 minute. Once this ability is used it cannot be called upon again until you complete a long rest. If you are a val\u2019Virdan, you may use your reaction to gain immunity to fire damage for 1 minute. Once this ability is used it cannot be called upon again until you complete a long rest. Addertongue Weapon (blowgun), very rare Description: Fashioned from the hollowed stem of a rare desert plant, the blowgun is about 4 feet in length and carven to resemble a serpent. History: The Pengik have used their signature long blowguns from time immemorial. Even before other humans came to Onara, Ichna\u2019gi shamans would use the blowguns as instruments to emit strange droning sounds that carried messages for miles across the Flinterlands. But while many Pengik used darts tipped with\u2003 deadly poisons in their blowguns, it was only during the Time of Terror that the first addertongue was created. The Ichna\u2019gi shamans were reluctant to alter their traditional weapons, but they finally relented in order to counter the greater threats of the infernal-ruled world. Today addertongues are primarily found among shamans, though some warriors carry them as well, while others have been traded to outsiders. Abilities/Effects: This magic weapon may be used as blowgun, mace or musical instrument. As either a mace or a blowgun, you gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls. When used as a blowgun, you may use a bonus action to whisper into the mouth piece to imbue a loaded needle with a deadly poison. Any creature hit with an imbued dart suffers an additional 2d8 poison damage and must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 minute. Once used, this ability cannot be used again until midnight. If this blowgun is played as an instrument, like a digeridoo, you gain advantage on all Charisma (Performance) checks made with it. See Chapter Nine for the rules and properties of a blowgun. Althares\u2019 Gift Weapon (flintlockpistol), very rare Description: This flintlock pistol is engraved with benedictions to Althares, the God of Wisdom and Knowledge. History: Altherians are never satisfied. Having learned the secrets of blastpowder, it was only a matter of time before they sought to maximize this gift. Pallas val\u2019Abebi, a young artificer, stumbled upon the secret of this flintlock early in his career, and with the abandon of youth he developed it. While the Council of Wisdom acknowledged his craftsmanship, they felt that the weapon took Althares\u2019 precious gift for granted, and would incur his wrath. After the Battle of Semar however, necessity forced the Altherians to reconsider Pallas\u2019s creation. They have begun manufacturing Althares\u2019gifts for the Shining Patrol and certain favored others. It remains to be seen if Altheria will once again pay a price for such hubris. Abilities/Effects: You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. You may use your action to load this weapon and say a prayer to Althares. This causes the weapon to lose its loading property and allow it to be fired 1d4+1 times before needing to be reloaded. It only consumes one piece of ammunition and magically duplicates it for each shot. The GM should roll for the exact number of shots but only inform the wielder when they have run out. Once the weapon is out of shots, you may either fire it as a normal flintlock or use another action to invoke Althares\u2019 blessing. Bow of the Five Peoples Weapon (longbow), very rare (requires attunement) Description: Tassels of preserved leaves and fine runes decorate the ends of this birch bow. History: The first of these bows were created by Arfeas, the renowned artificer of Malfea. These bows are given as high honors to elorii who prove themselves worthy, normally by slaying humans during the never-ending Malfelen War of Vengeance. Almost immediately the bows began appearing in Elonbe and Entaris as well. No elorii has officially admitted the obvious, that these warriors earned the bows by joining the Malfelens on their fell quest, and effort has been made to cover up the dark origins of these useful weapons. Abilities/Effects: You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. If you are an elorii, this bow also possesses additional abilities depending on your bloodline. Blessings to the Bloodline of Life (Ardakene): Arrows fired from this bow deal an extra ld6 radiant damage. As an action, you may transform a nocked arrow into radiant energy and fire it at a point within range, casting magic circle (affecting undead) centered on that point. Once this ability is used it cannot be called upon again until the next dawn. Blessings to the Bloodline of Water (Berokene): Arrows fired by this bow deal an extra 1d6 cold damage. As an action, you may transform a nocked arrow into frigid water and fire it at a point within range, casting sleet storm (save DC 16) centered on that point. Once this ability is used it cannot be called upon again until the next dawn. Blessings to the Bloodline of Fire (Kelekene): Arrows fired by this bow deal an extra ld6 fire damage. As an action, you may transform a nocked arrow into arcane\u2003 flames and fire it a point within range, casting fireball (save DC 16) centered on that point. Once this ability is used it cannot be used again until the next dawn. Blessings to the Bloodline of Earth (Marokene): Arrows fired by this bow deal an extra ld6 acid damage. As an action, you may transform a nocked arrow into enduring stone and fire it, casting wall of stone along the arrow\u2019s path. Once this ability is used it cannot be called upon again until the next dawn. Blessings to the Bloodline of Air (Osalikene): Arrows fired by this bow deal an extra ld6 lightning damage. As an action, you may transform a nocked arrow into rushing air and fire it, casting wind wall along the arrow\u2019s path. Once this ability is used it cannot be called upon again until the next dawn. Weapon (longbow), very rare (requires attunement) Description: This eloran longbow is exquisitely crafted to resemble winged dragons and made of enchanted silver, giving it the flexibility of a normal wooden bow. History: Among the elorii who fought on behalf of Yahssremore few were as feared as the Wyrm Riders, who rode their namesakes into battle and traveled in the company of the great wyrms. For this elite unit, the first silverbows were created by ssethric artificers, forged from the silver ore of the mountains where the drakes dwelled. The elorii no longer capture or ride drakes, nor have they allied with wyrms since their rebellion. Like most of their history as slaves, the elorii are not proud of the actions of the Wyrm Riders. The silverbows themselves, however, were too valuable to abandon, and their sculpted dragons remain as a reminder of the ancient past. Abilities/Effects: You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. When you hit with an attack with this weapon, it deals an additional ld6 cold damage. Any creature you attack with this bow with vulnerability to cold damage must make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or gain the paralyzed condition until the end of their next turn. Thunderbow Weapon (longbow), rare (requires attunement) Description: This longbow is constructed from hollow tubing and has a strange aquamarine hue, with accents molded into it that are reminiscent of avian wings. Each time a thunderbow is fired, its hollow construction creates a deep resonant booming that sounds like distant thunder. History: In the aftermath of the rebellion of Eppion, the Coryani took a renewed interest in the League of Princes, and a brief period ensued where imitation Kio styles were all the rage in the city of Savona. Enthralled by this style, Xaviera val\u2019Sheem, who despite her family was an adherent of Hurrian, crafted the beautiful thunderbow as a signature weapon for her swashbuckling adventures. The adventuring life hardened her, and within a decade she was no longer so concerned with frivolous beauty and elegance. She eventually sold the bow to an artificer from Ulfila. Abilities/Effects: You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic bow. As a bonus action, you may charge a nocked arrow with the power of the storm and fire it at a target within range. If the attack hits, it deals an additional 2d6 thunder damage and if the target is a creature it must succeed on a DC 16 Strength saving throw or be pushed 10 feet and knocked prone. Regardless of whether the attack hits or misses, this property cannot be used again until the next dawn.\u2003 SimPL\u20ac ra\u20acLGG Weapons Athame of High Magic Weapon (dagger), very rare (requires attunement) Description: This curving dagger is etched with sigils of power and draws energy that can empower spells. History: In the Far West, the Mad Magi of Lakhrion are a scourge upon the people of that region. To defend themselves, the various city-states that dot the area scavenge through ruins, crypts and barrows for these daggers to curry the favor of the Coven of the Wailing Sisters, a group of women who have suffered at the hands of the Mad Magi. These sorceresses, while able to wield arcane might, are not as skillful as their sworn enemy and find that the daggers boost their abilities. Like a pack of wolves, they harry their nemeses en masse as the Sisters know that even with the daggers, they are no match for more than one or two of the Magi. Abilities/Effects: This is a magic weapon which may be used as an arcane focus. This dagger possesses 3 charges. When casting a spell while using this weapon as an arcane focus, you may spend a bonus action and 1 charge to increase the effect of that spell as if you cast using a spell slot one level higher. This dagger regains ld3 of its spent charges daily at dawn. Bandoleer of Foe Daggers Weapon (daggers), uncommon (requires attunement) Description: These broad belts of Canceri design, are meant to be worn over the shoulder and across the breast. Crafted from finely tooled leather that is inlayed and decorated to make them appear as if the wearer is being consumed by a demon; with the creature\u2019s teeth replaced by eight daggers. History: Despite its appearance this bandoleer was not crafted by the Sarishans, but rather by the Nierites of northern Canceri. Borbala Soroka created the first belt during the First Crusade, containing a single knife deadly to fiends. Over centuries other Nierites crafted variations of the item, improving on Borbala\u2019s original enchantments. By the time of the Cancerese insurrection there were dozens of variations being made. With the Nierites forming the backbone of the new Cancerese military, however, artificers were encouraged to work together to create new items for the brave warriors. During such a council, the best features of many bandoleer designs were combined into the modern one, with eight daggers. Abilities/Effects: This bandoleer contains 8 magical daggers, each one imbued to do additional damage to a specific creature type. Each dagger deal an additional 1d6 piercing damage to its respective creature type. The creature types the daggers are imbued against are: aberrations, beasts, constructs, goblinoids, giants, infernals, monstrosities and ssethrics. Additionally, when performing a ranged attack using any of these daggers, the dagger returns to your hand immediately after the attack. This allows you to perform multiple attacks with the dagger using the same action, as long as you have a feature or ability that grants multiple attacks. Weapon (mace), very rare (requires attunement by a follower ofBeltine) Description: This is mace is made of strips of the highest- grade steel, painstakingly folded hundreds of times and wrapped to create the head of the mace. It has a long handle to counterbalance the heavy head, allowing it to be both a one-handed and two-handed weapon. History: Deimas val\u2019Ishi was a Beltinian Hospitaler whose skill in battle and devotion to Beltine were legendary, and matched only by her arrogance. In her hubris, she declared that she would reclaim the Twin Citadels ofBeltine and Neroth in the Blessed Lands, and reopen these holy shrines to the pilgrims. Against the wishes of her order she marched with fifty soldiers into the Blessed Lands. Only she emerged, bearing Beltine\u2019s Kiss. Attempts to question her were fruitless. Deimas val\u2019Ishi\u2003 had become quite mad. Scholars note that the mace does not appear to be ancient, however, indicating that either she had crafted it, or it had been crafted recently by someone, or something, else. Abilities/Effects: You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic mace. When you hit an undead creature with this weapon, it takes an extra 2d6 radiant damage. Should that undead have 25 hit points or fewer after taking this damage, it must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be destroyed. Clubs of Deuce Weapon (pair of clubs), very rare (requires attunement) Description: These twin belaying pins are elaborately carved from ironwood and with highlights lacquered in either red or blue to symbolize fire and ice. History: Many Solani dwarves reject the path of the perfect item, and instead follow the path of penitence. Among these was Baraut, who dedicated his life to the defense of humanity. His adventures took him to Coryan, where he found the poorest plebeians lived lives of fear in the slums. Baraut became their protector, never giving his name or asking for reward. The narrow alleys of the city made his traditional warhammer unwieldy, so he crafted these clubs. Many criminals preying on the poor learned to fear the flash of fire and ice as Baraut\u2019s clubs ricocheted off close-set walls to find their target. Abilities/Effects: These clubs are considered to be a single weapon for attunement. While welding both clubs in combat you gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage when attacking and possess the ability to deal bludgeoning or piercing damage with these magic weapons. Unlike common clubs, the clubs of deuce possess the thrown property with a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 40 feet. When you hit with a ranged attack utilizing either of these clubs it deals an additional 1d8 fire or cold damage, depending on which one of the two clubs where thrown. Immediately after the attack, the club flies back to your hand. Cradok Durass \u201cEarthshaker\u201d Weapon (great club), very rare (requires attunement) Description: The heavy steel head is carved to resemble a bull, the flat of the maul crafted as the bull\u2019s forehead. From the stomach of the bull extends a long, dark haft of ironwood, carved with runes of power. The pommel is a simple steel ring from which a lanyard hangs. History: On a rainy evening, a huge figure lumbered out of the night and approached a Shining Patrol station in the no man\u2019s land between the Ssethregoran Empire and the Altherian Republic. As the figure entered the dim illumination from the firelight, it was revealed to be an Ibon, an eight-foot-tall, yellow crested humanoid, dressed and girded for war. The Altherian soldiers, dumbfounded, reached for their weapons in preparation for a fight. The Ibon, looking unconcerned sat down at the fire, and began to prepare a meal. Perplexed, the men questioned the hungry giant as to its intentions. In perfect Low Coryani, responded, \u201cYou need all the help you can get against these snakes and I\u2019m very good at killing things\u2026 for a price.\u201d This was the beginning of one of the oddest arrangements in the history of the Shining Patrol. It seems that the Ibon, named Radjuborn, used to be an indentured slave/body guard for a Ymandrake \u2018merchant\u201d. His master was killed while traveling through the southern provinces of the Coryani Empire and Radjuborn decided to seek employment elsewhere. He had heard of the Shining Patrol and how they accepted anyone regardless of nationality, race or background and decided to join where he could be guaranteed constant food and shelter. It took some time and many solo forays by Radjuborn across the border to prove himself, but eventually he was accepted into the Patrol. Radjuborn swung Cradok Durass with bone shattering force, and the last sight of many Ssethregorans was the great club shattering their shield before smashing into them. Many of his fellow patrolmen asked about the incredible weapon, but all he would say was that it was given to him by his previous employer, a sorcerer of some lepule. After two decades of battling the ssethrics, he rose to be an officer, before finally being dragged down during an ambush. It took over a dozen Agamassi ss\u2019ressen to finally overwhelm\u2003 him, but it was there that Radjuborn\u2019s legend was writ, as he made a last stand to allow those under his command to escape. He was last seen beneath a veritable hill of the large lizard men, his famed shield, Cradok Morket torn from his grasp, while still swinging his great club. Abilities/Effects: You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magical great club. When you roll a 20 on an attack roll with this weapon, the target takes an extra 2d8 bludgeoning damage. In addition, when targeting a creature with a shield you may make an attack roll with disadvantage to strike the shield instead of the creature. If the attack hits, the creature takes no damage but their shield is destroyed. If the creature is using a magical shield, the creature must drop it but it remains intact. Dagger of One Thousand Cuts Weapon (dagger), very rare (requires attunement) Description: This finely crafted dagger appears for all appearances like a simple dagger. However, whenever it is thrown, or swung about, a swarm of partially real daggers seems to flow after it. History: This finely crafted dagger was as a gift by the mage Telven, to a rogue lost an arm while protecting him. This rogue was a master at wielding twin daggers in combat, but the loss of his left arm left him at quite the disadvantage. Feeling somewhat responsible for his friend\u2019s predicament, Telven fashioned a new, and quite special dagger for his friend. Abilities/Effects: You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. If you use this weapon to make a ranged attack and your attack hits, add ld4+l dice to your damage roll. If you score a critical hit, these additional dice are doubled as normal. Additionally, when you use this weapon to make a ranged attack, the weapon flies back to your hand immediately after the attack. Demonsbane Weapon (dagger), very rare (requires attunement) Description: This is a curved dagger, its steel stained sickly red by infernal blood. The edge appears ragged and corroded, yet it neither crumbles away nor grows dull. The hilt is wrapped with thin strips of white cloth, each printed with fine invocations and sigils of protection against Infernals. History: While this dagger is normally found among Sarishans and those who hunt Infernals, it was first created by the blasphemous Seekers of the Hidden Master. Though these heretics consort with demons, they are not stupid, and crafted the first such daggers in case their Infernal patrons preferred slaughter to bargains. The dagger must be crafted precisely, according to arcane geometry and wrapped in sigils of protection. The Seekers use blasphemous infernal litanies for this, though others tend to use cants of binding from the temple of Sarish. Finally, the dagger must be tempered in the blood of an unbound infernal. This last requirement accounts for the rarity of the dagger, even after the unsealing of the north. Abilities/Effects: You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. This bonus increases to +3 when you use this dagger to attack an infernal. Furthermore, while holding this weapon you gain advantage on saving throws made against spells cast by infernals or those with tainted blood, such as a dark-kin. Doomherald Weapon (hand axe), very rare (requires attunement) Description: This magnificent hand axe represents the pinnacle of forging technology known to the dwarves of Tultipet. Like many superior magical weapons of dwarven manufacture, the blade is made from ingots of green-iron and black-iron steel, superheated then compressed, folded and magically cooled hundreds of times, ensuring a durable and razor sharp edge. The center of its blade is carved out, leaving a hollow space behind the edge, with a haft of ribbed ironwood and a chain to secure the weapon against a possible slip. History: Duleng Firand of Tultipet crafted this axe under the inspiration of an oracular dream. He did not know why he was so compelled, but he felt a great dread from the vision, naming the axe Doomherald. Both he and his apprentices used the axe as a template for other creations, but the original always stayed in his forge, waiting for its time. That time finally came when the great dragon, Villa\u2019tavorentes, exacted his revenge and destroyed the enclave of Tultipet. Finally, Duleng knew the purpose of his vision. He has abandoned the forge to wander the land,\u2003 his axe does heralding the doom of not the True Dragon that devastated his home and people, but the humans and their descendants that released it. Abilities/Effects: You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage when attacking with this magic weapon. While this weapon is held, you may use an action to see through up to 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt for up to 10 minutes. This axe has the thrown property with a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet. When you hit with a ranged attack using this weapon it deals an extra ld8 thunder damage or, if the target is a giant, 2d8 thunder damage. When used to make a ranged attack, this axe immediately returns to your hand once the attack is finished. Fangs of Vapriss Weapon (javelin), rare Description: These weapons are built from the bones of serpents and have been enchanted so as to transform into serpents when thrown in combat. History: These javelins were created during the elorii uprising and used with great efficacy by the ruthless ssanu general, Vapriss, the Venom of Yig. This holy champion of the Ssethric deity delighted in taking elorii skulls as trophies, which she would hang on a specially crafted net that covered her long, sinuous body. She commanded the artificers of Yahssremore to create javelins that changed shape into a likeness of her blessed goddess. She particularly terrified the elorii for she dedicated every elorii killed as a tribute to the goddess Yig. To this day, none of the elorii souls killed by Vapriss has been resurrected through the Orumar. Abilities/Effects: This javelin is a magical weapon. When you hurl it and speak the command word, it transforms into a large viper and attacks your intended target at the beginning of your turn for 8 turns, or until your intended target is dead. When either of these conditions occurs, the viper dissolves into green mist, reappearing as a javelin in your hand. Once this ability is used it cannot be called upon again until the next dawn, though the javelin continues to function as a magical weapon. For stats on the giant viper, use the snake (poisonous, giant) stats from the Core rules. Forger of Chains Weapon (dagger), rare (requires attunement) Description: This dagger has a cross guard shaped like the gaping mouth of a fiend, with the blade sticking out of its mouth as if it were its tongue. This cross guard is connected to a bracelet worn by the wearer, while the blade is inscribed with Sarishan sigils. History: During the Time of Terror, when the infernal hordes marched south, there was a great need to study unbound infernals to develop tactics against them. Ceren val\u2018Mehan saw an opportunity to gain a profit while also increasing humanity\u2019s knowledge of these fiends. She crafted the first of these weapons, and became renowned as an infernal bounty hunter. For a princely sum, she and her mercenary band would hunt down an unbound infernal of the type desired, paralyze it with forger of chains, and drag it back to civilization to be studied, enslaved, or dissected as their patrons wished. It was not long before the infernals learned of this and began hunting her down, at which point she decided she had earned enough wealth and retired, leaving the weapon to her prot\u00e9g\u00e9. Abilities/Effects: This Sarishan steel bladed bracer is a\u2003 must make DC 12 Charisma saving throw or be magically bound within a cocoon of energy, gaining the paralyzed condition but being protected from all outside forces. The bound creature remains cocooned for 7 days; this duration is reduced by 1 day for every CR of the creature, with creatures with a CR greater than 6 breaking free from the blade\u2019s binding power at the end of their next turn. While you may only bind one creature at a time, as a reaction you may choose to shed your own blood with the weapon, utilizing your blood to empower the binding. For every 10 hit points of damage you sacrifice, you increase the duration of the creature\u2019s entrapment 1 day. This damage may not be healed while the creature is bound by this weapon. For the worn weapon quality see Chapter Nine under new weapons. Kur\u2019s Tooth Weapon (spear), very rare (optional attunement) Description: This magical spear appears to be crudely made, its point made of unnaturally hard, carved and scrimshawed horn. History: About the ancient Yahssremoran city of Tasmek ranged the nomadic Gar known as the Gar Kur. These Gar were constantly harried by undead created by the ssethric necromancer-priests of Wantir, the God of the Death. Within Tasmek, these reptilian necromancers created undead servants, some of which rose again as intelligent undead, unsuitable to their needs and cast them out into the wilderness. With so many Gar falling prey to these undead, the shamans of the tribe gathered to create a weapon to protect their people. In a dark ritual, they invoked the spirits and consecrated the spear by using it to sacrifice their chieftain. The blood- soaked spear was given to the chieftain\u2019s eldest, to hunt down and destroy the undead. But a weapon created by black magic cannot be used for long without tainting the wielder. The spear awakened and whispered its secrets to the tribe\u2019s new leader. It tempted him with more power, enough to challenge the might of priests of Wantir. Eventually, the Gar chieftain led a raid with many of his own raised from the dead and began slaughtering the ssethrics of Tasmek. The High Priest of Wantir, Prasshk, was forced to call for assistance to fend off the attack and as well as take back control of the city, as the dead now outnumbered the living. In the end the empire had to raze the entire city to the ground. The Gar Kur were exterminated, though the spear was never found. Abilities/Effects: You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. Optional Attunement: If you choose to become attuned to this spear and are not attuned to any other weapons, Kur\u2019s Tooth begins to whisper to you, revealing its greater power. Eventually, as an action the spear grants you the ability to call forth a wave of necrotic energy that you may focus on one of two effects: You may force all undead with a CR of 2 or lower within 60 feet to make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the undead is utterly destroyed. Undead who succeed on this save or have a CR greater than 2 are unaffected. You may use this energy to cast animate dead, creating three skeletons who follow your commands until the next dawn. Once either of these abilities is used, neither may be used again until the next midnight. Legionspear Weapon (spear), rare Description: The legionspear, called a pilum by the legionnaires, is a primarily a throwing spear, though it can be used in melee, if necessary. History: When Aneas val\u2019Assante was made general of the Legion of the Triumphant Rays of the Invincible Sun, the legion had been nearly destroyed in the recent Coryani-Ymandrake war. Aneas reorganized the legion from the ground up, developing new tactics focusing on the pilum. Playing on the legion\u2019s name, he trained his men to throw the pilum in tandem, like the triumphant rays of the sun flashing out at the darkness. The Emperor was impressed that Aneas had salvaged a legion so near destruction, and granted him resources that the general used to make the first legionspears for his best commanders. Abilities/Effects: You gain a +1 bonus to ranged attack and damage rolls made with this magical weapon. Furthermore, while throwing this spear, if you hit a creature with this weapon in the same round that one of your allies hit the same creature with a ranged attack, you deal an additional ld6 piercing damage. Mercy Weapon (quarterstajf, unique), legendary (requires attunement by a val\u2019Ishi) Description: Smoothed by centuries of use, this stout, undecorated, oaken staff is a blessed weapon of the Flealer aspect of Beltine. History: The origins of the necrotic plague that swept the southern reaches of the Imperium of Man\u2003 are unknown. Some blamed Ssethregoran bio-engineering, or an infernal curse, while others saw judgment of the Gods. Those it did not kill swiftly suffered a far worse fate, a wasting illness that ended with transformation into a hideous undead horror. Thais val\u2019Ishi, priestess of Beltine, insisted on traveling to the afflicted land to study the plague. There she dwelled, healing whom she could. Those that she could not heal she slew, for the destruction of the undead was a mercy. It was during these years that she crafted this staff, to aid her both in healing, and in destruction. Thais and her followers were able to stem the tide of the disease, but not before it claimed her life. Her apprentice took up the staff, and showed Thais its final mercy by destroying the creature she became. Abilities/Effects: This magic weapon functions as a staff of healing with the additional ability to cast regeneration (10 charges). Unlike a normal staff of healing, this magic weapon has no risk of being lost forever, nor can it be used to attack a living creature. When attacking undead, you gain a +2 to attack and damage rolls with this magic weapon. When you hit a corporeal undead (such as a zombie) it takes an extra 3d10 radiant damage. Nerothian Assassins Blade Weapon (dagger), uncommon Description: Pitted and badly rusted, this unassuming blade is nonetheless a dangerous and powerful tool. History: After their initial defeats in the Heretic Wars many Milandisians began to talk of surrender. At that moment, however, death struck Ashvan. Children, innocent townsfolk, and even priests of the church were slain by a contagion which healers soon declared to be magical and deliberately inflicted. Passions against the Nerothian disease-bearers raged, and the people of Milandir rallied to battle once again. But it was not Nerothians who had committed the deed. A Priest of Hurrian, seeking to motivate the people, had crafted this dagger to cast blame on the Cancerese. When this was discovered investigators were horrified. The priest was given a swift traitor\u2019s death, and the entire incident was silenced by order of King Andreas II. The dagger itself was stolen by thieves, and the copies eventually created can be purchased on the black market. Abilities/Effects: If you score a critical hit against a creature or deal sneak attack damage to a creature, you may cast contagion (save DC 14, disease option slimy doom) targeting that creature. Once this ability is used it may not be used again until midnight. Nightfire Weapon (mace), legendary (requires attunement) Description: This fluted silver rod is capped at one end with white-silver quartz. The other end of the rod opens out into a concave space with a decorated rim around it. History: Gusta Gloriana\u2019s signature weapon reflects her many adventures in the eighth century. She acquired it as a gift from the Kio after fending off a barbarian horde from Uggur. From there she traveled to the Lhauzyr Mountains and befriended the Tir Betoqi dwarves, who laid the first enchantments upon it. With her allies, she took the long trek through Canceri and in Nishanpur she endeared herself to the Illiirites known as the Confraternity of the Just Death, who further enchanted the mace. Gusta was slain defending pilgrims during the second Coryani- Khitani war, but Nightfire was recovered and remains a weapon of great interest, though Gusta\u2019s own tale is seldom remembered. Abilities/Effects: You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. When you wield this weapon, the concave end fills with a ball of radiant energy that sheds bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. While this light is active, your attacks with this weapon deal radiant damage instead of bludgeoning. Additionally, if you roll a 20 while attacking with this weapon your target must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be stunned until the end of their next turn.

A devil\u2019s tooth caps the end of the hilt, painted with Sarishan sigils in ichor. The blade itself is Sarishan steel, thin and double-edged. One edge is serrated near the hilt, to cause extra pain. History: An outbreak of unbound infernals unleashed by the Seekers of the Hidden Master took everything from Jamshi Feroze, and merely killing the fiends was not vengeance enough. They needed to suffer. He became a Sarishan who specialized in binding, and once bound he would subject the infernals to cruel tortures with the help of oathmaker. He crafted the blade himself from the body parts of his victims around a blade of Sarishan steel. Jamshi is now an old and frail man, but that has not stopped him from filling his dungeon with the screams of bound infernals.

One of these was Zephyra val\u2019Dellenov, daughter of the first val\u2019Dellenov. Legend has it that she changed the course of the Nardau River, drove a great evil out of the Faerdwalden, and first peopled Sylvania with her children. Always in these tales her magical spear Pathfinder is at her side. Zephyra had only to name a thing, and Pathfinder would unerringly point the way.

Petrus Kafan: \u201cHope\u2019s Dart\u201d Weapon (spear), very rare (requires attunement) Description: This simple ash hafted spear has a remarkably adorned cold iron spearhead, depicting the eternal struggle between the Infernal Lord and the First Emperor. History: At the battle of Hope\u2019s End, the Infernal Horde finally turned and faced the assembled forces of the armies of the First Emperor of Coryan. There, a legendary duel was fought between the forces of the Devil King Uhxbractit and the First Emperor. According to legend, the battle raged for eight days until the First Emperor was struck with a poisoned dart. The base attack was witnessed by young Yolim val\u2019Tensen and vowed that the cowardly attack would not go unanswered. As the mass of humanity rushed down on their Infernal foes in vengeance, Yolim took up his shortspear, called upon the strength of the god Hurrian and let fly. It is said that Hurrian and Sarish looked down upon the young warrior and the treachery that befell Illiir\u2019s chosen and sent Their blessings, with Hurrian strengthening his arm and Sarish blessing the dart. The spear flew over the charging legionnaires and struck true, burying itself in the breast of the foul, fiend that had poisoned the Emperor. There was a blinding flash of light and a howl of pure terror from the creature. As the light cleared, the Infernal was no more; vengeance had been served. Since that time, priests of Hurrian and Sarish worked together to recreate Petrus Kafan, literally \u201cHope\u2019s Dart\u201d in ancient Altharin. Their efforts produced shortspears of amazing powers, which are given to those legions venturing into Canceri or any place where Infernals may be found.

History: Ivor Kilmek was a Milandisian bard of noble birth who came to Savona to add wine and women to his life of song, but instead found himself caught up in the Savonan dueling culture. Here was a thrill he did not know he had needed, and he threw himself into the dashing world of the swashbuckler, favoring the shortsword and dagger. He raided his family treasury, discovering vials of infernal ichor handed down from an adventuring ancestor. Using the blood, he crafted shadowsong, and with it he won many duels. It is whispered that when a rival finally slew him his soul passed into the dagger, damned by his use of the tainted fluid. Abilities/Effects: You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic dagger. This increases to +2 when you wield it against infernals. When you use a bonus action to attack with this weapon, it deals an additional 3d6 piercing damage. Any time this dagger is thrown as a ranged attack, it immediately flies back to your hand after the attack. Sickle of the Mighty Oak Weapon (sicklej, rare (requires attunement) Description: This sickle is comprised of a silver blade ornamented with oak leaves and acorns with a shaft made from the finest oak. History: The legends of the Legion of the Mighty Oak are too numerous to count, but outsiders rarely hear of the cadre of Saluwean druids who forego their sacred groves to join the legion as a support unit. Dressed in hide and leather instead of lorica, and performing sacred rituals to heal the wounded and cleanse the land after every battle, the powers of these druids have contributed greatly to the success of the legion. In the fourth century Lebuin val\u2019Dellenov, archdruid of the Golden Boughs of Saluwe, acknowledged their sacrifice by commissioning new weapons for the druids who were averse to the traditional gladii. For their leader Lebuin created the sickle of the mighty oak personally, to thank him for his service. The original sickle is still held by the leader of the cadre today. Abilities/Effects: You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. While this weapon held any spell you cast of 1 st level or higher to restore hit points to a creature heals an additional number of hit points equal to your proficiency bonus.

Once used, this second ability cannot be used again until the next dawn. Torment Weapon (dagger, unique), legendary (requires attunement by a val\u2019Inares or worshiper ofAnshar) Description: Torment is an ancient basalt dagger that brings agonizing pain to all that it strikes. Vicious serrations along the blade\u2019s length cause brutal wounds that have difficulty closing. The handle of this blade is wrapped in blood-stained leather; blood drawn by the thorns that pierce the leather and the hand of the wielder. History: Agrippas val\u2019Inares is said to have created this blade during the Shadowed Age. He did not. As he grew older Agrippas felt the calling to enter a portal for an unknown destination, like all val\u2019Inares. He was met on the other side by Ssanu of the Ssethregoran Empire, eager to sacrifice him. One of them wielded Torment, and Agrippas ripped the dagger from the creature\u2019s grip. Immediately he felt a kinship with the blade, and could wield it expertly and escape. The experience addled his mind deeply, and little of what he was able to express to the val\u2019Inares family made sense, but his rantings were written down in scrolls kept secret by the family, and Torment itself became a holy relic of Anshar. Agrippas re-entered a portal three years later, and never returned. Abilities/Effects: You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. If you hit a living creature with this weapon, their hit point maximum is reduced by ld4. All monks and divine spellcasters who venerate Anshar automatically have proficiency with this weapon, and this weapon is considered a monk weapon for worshipers of Anshar.\u2003 Wind Staff Weapon (quarterstaff), very rare (requires attunement) Description: A quarterstaff made from the wood of a white ash tree, decorated with carvings depicting swirling air and a pair of horns on top. History: During the First Crusade of Light, the leader who forged the Coryani Empire found himself pinned with the Corlathian Mountains at his back and besieged on all sides by hordes of infernals. Undaunted, the First Emperor climbed to the summit of Mt. Olmacha, found a white ash tree that grew there, and broke off a branch. Within moments, he had fashioned a staff whose top was curved like ram\u2019s horns. As he crafted the staff, he was observed by a val\u2019Tensen shepherd who hid behind an outcropping of rocks and stared in wonder at the Emperor\u2019s calm demeanor, knowing that an army of infernals stood ready to smash his fledgling legions at nightfall. The shepherd\u2019s reverie was broken by his commanding voice, calling him from his hiding place. \u201cCome to my side, Lenes val\u2019Tensen, and see what I have wrought. \u201d Shaken, the young shepherd approached. The First Emperor held the staff aloft and suddenly the faint winds began to swirl and gather strength, until they roared like a wounded beast. A small whirlwind appeared, unfolding like a fresh bloom. Nestled within, a great air elemental lord appeared and bowed its head. \u201cWhat is thy bidding, co us in ? \u2019\u2019With but a few words, the Emperor made clear his desires. That evening, the infernals were routed by not just the forces of the Coryani legions, but by the might of the Lord of the Howling Winds and his hosts. After the battle, the Emperor called for the val\u2019Tensen shepherd and gave him the staff. Fie spoke of the deadly evil that roamed the lands on the other side of the mountain range and his desire that his people be guarded against these perils. The Emperor tasked the young man with forming a cadre of rangers to patrol the mountains, and whispered in his ear the secret of crafting such a staff so that they could be armed with the power of the winds. Years passed and the infernal hordes became trapped behind the Wall of the Gods. The First Emperor passed on and the fledging alliance of territories grew into the vast Coryani Empire. True to his vow, Lenes val\u2019Tensen gathered men about him and taught them to survive and thrive in the rugged mountainous terrain. When the training of his first group was complete, he called upon the power of the staff to contact the Lord of the Howling Winds and was surprised to see that a lone small elemental of air appeared instead. \u201cYou are not the Lord of the Howling Winds,\u201dLenes gaped in surprise. \u201cYou are not the Emperor,\u201d the elemental replied matter-of-factly. The wind staff is the symbol of the val\u2019Tensen rangers who protect those who travel throughout the Corlathian mountain range. The secret of its creation has been handed down exactly as the First Emperor instructed. An apprentice ranger must craft his own staff, empower it, and attune an air elemental to heed its call. Abilities/Effects: You gain a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. While you are attuned to this item, you gain a fly speed of 30 feet. Summon Air Elemental: As an action you may summon an air elemental of a CR equal to double your proficiency bonus. The elemental appears in an unoccupied space you choose within 120 feet of you. It remains for a maximum of 1 hour, until you use another action to dismiss it, or until it drops to 0 hit points, after which it returns to its elemental plane. While summoned, the elemental is friendly to you and to your companions. It obeys any commands you give it, no matter what language you use. If you fall unconscious or fail to command it, the elemental defends itself and you against attackers but takes no other actions. After the elemental departs, this property cannot be used again until 7 days have passed. Simple RfingGD weapons Seeking Sling Weapon (sling), very rare Description: This plain and unremarkable strip of leather is popular with thieves, and other ne\u2019er-do-wells. These weapons are ideal for use in the confined, crowded spaces such as the busy street markets of Grand Coryan or other large cities. History: Young Bianca Desiderio, unlike many of her peers on the streets of Old Coryan, was determined to make something of herself. She spent what coins she could beg or pickpocket on lessons, studied magical crafting, and eventually became apprenticed to an artificer, but she never\u2003 forgot where she came from. When Big Dario was killed in a turf war, she made the first seeking sling so her old gang could avenge him. Using her creation her friends were able to make names for themselves in the Fellowship of Little Savona, and soon Bianca\u2019s skills were in high demand from Old Coryan\u2019s criminals. Abilities/Effects: You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic sling. Also, while holding this weapon, as a bonus action, you may whisper a name of a creature to the weapon. The creature named does not benefit from cover or being in an obscured area if attacked with this weapon.

Silent Death Weapon (short bow, unique), legendary (requires attunement by a val\u2019Borda) Description: Silent Death is an ancient composite short bow crafted from the finest polished ebony wood. History: Idesta val\u2019Borda was only fifteen when she fought at the Battle of Hope\u2019s End. When the Second Crusade began, she was an old woman, but her intelligence had not diminished. She saw that Abessios itself was impenetrable, for the Vizier of the Phaeron Kefrin had mastery of the magical spells warding that city. She could no longer enter battle herself, but she strained her powers to the breaking point crafting her finest weapon, Silent Death. When the bow was completed she died, her spirit spent in the summoning of such power. Taking up the bow the val\u2019Borda marched on Abessios. As the Vizier opened his mouth to command his arcane powers the bow was fired, and silence fell upon him. Before he could recover, Twilight Warriors had jumped through shadow and buried their blades in him. The way to Abessios was opened. Abilities/Effects: You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic bow. All arrows fired from this bow create no sound as they pass through the air, and this weapon\u2019s normal range is extended out to its long range of 320 feet. When the arrow strikes a target, a 30-foot bubble of silence surrounds the target for 1 minute. No sound can pass through the bubble and any creature inside the bubble is deafened and immune to thunder damage. Any spell that requires a verbal component cannot be cast inside the bubble. WOnDRQUS Items Amulet of Belisarda\u2019s Fury Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement by an elorii) Description: These amulets appear as simple wooden holy symbols bearing the symbol of Belisarda. History: After the Godswar, the priesthood of Belisarda knew that while their vengeance might be postponed, the elorii homelands must remain defended. These amulets were first forged in Elonbe for that purpose and enhanced the reputation of the Vastwood as being impenetrable to humans. After the Malfelan elorii began using these amulets on their assaults on mankind, the Life Wardens altered these items, requiring an oath, dedicated to Belisarda, to defend the elorii homelands in order to activate the amulet. While this might seem a simple thing, it has nonetheless been effective at dissuading the abuse of these items by elorii who might ignore Ardelia\u2019s prophecy. Abilities/Effects: This amulet has 3 charges and regains ld3 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a roll of 1 the amulet cannot regain charges until submerged in an Orumar for 1 day. While you wear this amulet, you can use an action and expend 1 charge to send yourself into a divinely inspired frenzy. For 1 minute, all your melee weapon attacks and unarmed strikes deal an additional ld4 damage of their usual type and you gain advantage on all Strength checks. While this effect is active you can only use lethal force. You may not use this ability if you have levels of exhaustion Once the duration of the effect has ended, or if you fall unconscious, or if all enemies within 30 feet of you have been killed, you suffer 1 level of exhaustion. Amulet of Illiir\u2019s Perfect Brilliance Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement by a divine spellcaster ofllliir) Description: This amulet that is fashioned from hand-carved alder branches and shaped into a sunburst after weeks of pain-staking work. It is then blessed and consecrated to Illiir. History: When humans arrived on the shores of Onara they faced a dilemma. The amidet of Illiir\u2019s perfect brilliance, worn by the most faithful of the King of the Gods, must be crafted from freshly cut, hale branches of the alder tree. Seeds of the alder tree had been brought to the continent, but the trees that grew from them were subtly changed by the new soil and climate, and were no longer perfect in Illiir\u2019s sight. For a full one thousand years, holy orders of Saluwe tended to sacred groves across the Imperium in the grandest husbandry project known to human history. Finally, with much rejoicing and great celebration, the Priesthood ofllliir pronounced one of their alder trees to be sufficiently perfect to once again craft the amulet. This \u201cperfect\u201d strain of trees has been carefully guarded and cultivated ever since, and only a few branches are allowed to be cut each year by properly consecrated artificers. Abilities/Effects: This amulet may be used as a divine focus. While this amulet is worn, it will emit a faint light equivalent to a candle, shedding bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet. You can activate or suppress this ability at will. This amulet has 3 charges and regains ld3 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a roll of 1 the amulet cannot regain charges until you place it in the light of the sun for a total of 24 hours. While wearing this amulet, you may use an action and expend a charge to cast daylight. Amulet of the Faithful Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement by worshiper of the deity of the amulet) Description: These amulets are simple platinum discs etched with a deity\u2019s holy symbol on the front and a prayer to the deity on the obverse. History: The first records of these amulets stretch back to the early days of the Imperium of Man. According to records, the priesthood and those mages among the faithful worked together to mass produce these amulets as tokens for the clerisy. Alas, since the fall of the Imperium such production is impossible, and these amulets have become both rarer and more valuable. Some examples have been found among the elorii, which are officially explained as the elorii corrupting human symbols of devotion. Fiowever, a few obscure\u2003 reports from the Emerald Society claim to have found similar items written in Ssethric, stretching back to the Empire of Yahssremore, suggesting that perhaps it was the humans who learned the art of these amulets from the elorii instead. These reports are controversial and are dismissed by most scholars. Abilities/Effects: These amulets are inscribed with the holy symbol of a single specific deity. If you worship the god whose symbol is on the amulet, you may use the amulet as a divine focus. Also, any time you use the Channel Divinity feature you gain 1d10 temporary hit points for 1 hour. Amulet of Vigilance Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement) Description: Crafted from jade and carved to appear as a holy symbol of Kassegore (a serpent devouring its own tail), this armlet will increase or decrease in size to fit any wearer\u2019s bicep. History: At the height of the Ssethregoran Empire these armlets were crafted by the Priesthood of Kassegore to protect their troops from the many enslaved and oppressed beings who sought to revolt against their reptilian masters. These items have become increasingly rare in modern times, mainly because elorii will destroy them wherever they find them, and wearing the symbol of Kassegore in the Ssethregoran Empire is considered blasphemy since the coming of the Varn. All attempts to alter the appearance of these armlets by the Ssethregorans have failed, which some see as a sign that the items are inherently blasphemous. Abilities/Effects: While wearing this amulet you have a +5 bonus to your passive Perception and advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks. If you are surprised while wearing this amulet, you can call upon its power to act normally during your first turn. Once used, this ability cannot be used again until the next dawn. Anklet of the Harlot Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement) Description: This beautiful, finely wrought, golden chain is studded with blood-red rubies and sparkling diamonds. Designed to be worn about the ankle, it is often seen in the possession of wealthy women across the Known Lands. History: This item was created by a besotted mage for his Larissan priestess and the sisters of her \u201ctemple\u201d. What followed was a series of robberies and bloody murders in every major city of the Coryani Empire and into the Kingdom of Milandir. The crime spree ended abruptly in the city of Tralia, when the entire coterie was found strangled in a local brothel. Though the assassins were never identified, many believe it was the Troupe of the Final Note, posing as the entertainment in the brothel. Abilities/Effects: While this anklet is worn you are immune to the poisoned condition. Additionally, as an action you may cast sleep (save DC 12). Once used, this ability cannot be used again until the next dawn. Apron of the Artificer Wondrous item, rare Description: This blackened and fire-scarred leather apron contains numerous tiny pockets. When worn by an artificer, this apron grants access to a number of different tool-kits, all readily available at hand. History: The dwarven master-smith Tergaunt of Solanos Mor is remembered both for his skill and as a cautionary tale. Like many of his brethren, he was dedicated to crafting the perfect item in order to free his enclave, yet he found the inefficiency of the crafting process intolerable. He turned his prodigious skill toward time-saving devices. One of his greatest successes was the creation of the apron of the artificer, thus saving precious minutes by avoiding having to search for the right tool in a cluttered smithy. Ironically, Tergaunt\u2019s obsession with creating time-saving magic items consumed him, and he died without ever attempting to craft the perfect item. Abilities/Effects: While this apron is worn you may take an action to reach into any of the apron\u2019s many pockets and produce a tiny set of mundane tools, which grow to full size once placed upon the ground. You may only produce one set of tools at a time, any previously drawn tools vanish into mist. Tools drawn from the apron of the artificer remain in existence until the next dawn. Armbands of Blade Turning Wondrous item, rare Description: Worn high on the arms, these bracers temporarily protect their wearer from blows. Made from board hide, they are lined with linen or silk and are edged with iron bands, sewn on with catgut. History: These armbands are a recent creation, dating from the withdrawal of the Coryani empire from the Hinterlands. The Yhing hir realized they needed better tools to expand\u2003 and thrive in a region suddenly empty of the legions, and their Nawals overcame their suspicion and rivalry to command their greatest crafters to work together to create such tools. Several magical items were created, but one of the most renowned and most sought-after by the horsemen of the Yhing hir were armbands of blade turning, which best suited the lightly-armored and highly-mobile horsemen. Abilities/Effects: These armbands possess 3 charges. While worn, as a reaction to being struck by a melee attack, you can expend 1 charge to gain resistance to slashing damage, including damage from the triggering attack, until the end of your next turn. These armbands recover 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn. Armguard of Talisos Wondrous item, very rare Description: This eloran item is designed to wrap around the forearm, and consists of a triple layer of leather with cords on one end and button attachments at the other. History: The height of the eloran empire was a time of peace, protected by swift arrows and shining blades. Thus, the great Osalikene mage Talisos crafted weapons of war to preserve the peace. The armguards of Talisos are among his most treasured creations. For years he toiled, crafting precisely one thousand of the armguards, of which an unknown number have survived to the present day. While rare and jealously guarded, the armguards are not considered sacred and so have, rarely, been given to outsiders that perform acts of great courage and self\u00acsacrifice to help the elorii nations. Abilities/Effects: While wearing this armguard you ignore half and three-quarters cover when attacking with a longbow or shortbow. Winds of Osalian: You must be an elorii to attune to this item. As a bonus action, you can gain advantage on a ranged attack with a bow. Once used, this ability cannot be used again until you have completed a short rest. Armillus of the Laurel of Vigilance Wondrous item, rare Description: This golden armband is ribbed and stamped with the seal of the Coryani Empire, a falcon with its wings outspread. History: One of the highest honors that can be given by the Coryani Empire, the armillus of the Laurel of Vigilance is awarded for acts of extreme heroism in the service of the Empire. Non-citizens who are given the armillus of the Laurel of Vigilance are considered citizens of the Empire and granted all the rights and privileges thereof. Coryani citizens awarded the armillus are held in the highest esteem by all imperial citizens and accorded places of honor when and where appropriate. Abilities/Effects: The armillus grants advantage in Charisma (Persuasion) checks when dealing with citizens of the Coryani Empire. Protection of the Empire (Requires Attunement): You gain a +1 bonus to AC and saving throws while wearing the armillus. Aros\u2019 Unforgettable Mark Description: These small rectangular bookmarks are crafted from the tanned wings of a bat and embossed in gold-leaf with an arcane glyph. History: Originally created for the absent-minded eloran scholar Aros to help him recall bits of obscure lore, the enchantment was copied by the magi of the Imperium after the bookmark was discovered in a burning ruin during the razing of Belestor. bilities/Effects: When you place this bookmark within a book, you can easily recall information from its pages. You have advantage on Intelligence checks relating to the subject matter of the tome in which the bookmark is placed. This bonus is granted so long as you and the book and are on the same plane. You can only benefit from one Aros\u2019 unforgettable mark at a time; you are always connected to the most recent bookmark you placed in a book. Description: Warders appear to be weird puppet-like dolls commonly made in the image of gar, infernals or other grim creatures. They are sewn or pinned onto backpacks, pouches, hats or other equipment. Warders are fashioned from any material used to fashion dolls, but jade or a precious metal is sometimes used. History: These decorative objects were originally created by the paranoid and eccentric Moratavian wizard Badua the Strange, who made them to foil assassinations, ward belongings from thieves, and guard her while she slept. They remain constantly active, scaring off would- be assailants and ruining surprise attacks by emitting unearthly howls and haunting sounds as a warning to their wearer Abilities/Effects: During a long rest, you can place a warder anywhere within 20 feet of you, as long as it remains in your sight. When you place the warder, you can designate creatures that will not trigger its scream. While you rest the warder watches over you; if any Tiny or larger creature comes within 20 feet of you it will emit a high pitched scream, loud enough to wake up any creature within 50 feet. As a reaction, you may trigger your warder to shed bright light 20 feet and dim light for an additional 20 feet beyond that. Warders have an AC of 15 and 30 hit points. Barding of Grace Armor, rare Description: This suit of finely crafted chainmail barding has patterns of colored links, fine threads woven through the mail and brightly colored tassels hanging from its lower edge. History: This enchanted barding is sought after by the richest of knights in the Milandisian territory of Eastmarch as a way of counteracting Yhing hir raiders\u2019 speed with greater protection. Abilities/Effects: This suit of chainmail barding grants a +1 bonus to your mount\u2019s AC and advantage on Dexterity saving throws. Barding of Power Armor, very rare Description: Tightly packed steel plates, designed to cover the entire horse, provide the basis for this full-plate barding. The plates are engraved and inlayed with the crest and colors of Milandir, while ritual symbols for strength and courage are engraved in black iron into the sides. History: It is said that few things are as terrifying as standing one\u2019s ground against a charge of Milandisian mounted knights. Tales of horsemen tearing through lines, leaving nothing but a bloody smear in their wake are particularly true of those mounts equipped with this enchanted armor. The tactic known as the \u2018steel storm\u2019, so called because of the thunder of the horses\u2019 hooves and the clouds of dust raised, was originally developed by the val\u2019Tensen using mounts wearing this armor strategically placed throughout the line. It proved so effective that other armies using cavalry have their own variation of this tactic. Abilities/Effects: This suit of plate barding grants a +1 bonus to your mount\u2019s AC, and increases the Strength score of the mount to 21, to a maximum of 21. Barding of Stamina Armor, uncommon Description: Strong steel plates form the basis for this breastplate barding. Symbols of stamina and courage are etched in platinum into the barding\u2019s sides. History: These enchanted suits of barding were crafted by the lords of Haina so that their cavalry could contend with the unnatural endurance of the hell-horses used by the Himmatah Riders of the Fiendish Expanse. With the fall of the Godswall and the increased trade between the formally isolated Haina Empire and the people of the Known Lands, this enchanted piece of barding is seeing use beyond the Unsealed Lands. Abilities/Effects: This suit of breastplate barding grants your mount advantage on Constitution saving throws. Beltine\u2019s Blessed Relief Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement by a worshiper of Beltine) Description: These pins are forged in the shape of a censer, the holy symbol of the Goddess Beltine. History: During the Imperium of Man a great theological debate raged between Beltinians and Nerothians over the virtues of Neroth\u2019s gift. The Beltinians believed the gift should only be tolerated when spontaneously granted by Neroth, if at all. The Nerothians, on the other hand, believed the gift should be deliberately spread to the worthy. While the debate raged the Beltinian priesthood took matters into their own hands, crafting these pins to protect themselves from rogue Nerothian necromancers, whom they warned preyed upon the newly deceased faithful and destroyed their soul. A panic began, and those wealthy enough gladly donated to the Beltinian temple to receive a pin and protect themselves from the Nerothians. On a wave of public paranoia, the Beltinians won the debate, and the temple continues to create the pins to this day.\u2003 Abilities/Effects: While this pin is worn you have advantage on all death saving throws.

History: In the early days of the Coryani Empire, the priesthood of Anshar became aware of a fanatical sect of Ansharan monks who had crossed the line into heresy. While Ansharans of all kind endure pain as a holy devotion, this sect devoted themselves to an aspect of Anshar wholly devoted to experiencing and causing all forms of pain, purely for its own sake. Seeking to deal with this threat internally before the Inquisition became involved, the Ansharans dispatched their holy champions, the Bearers of Woe. What the Bearers of Woe found in the sect\u2019s monastery has never been revealed, but the sect ceased to exist, and the Bearers of Woe emerged with the first blood robes.

History: Poor Alwan was a good boy; bright, respectful of his elders, and brave. Unfortunately, he had no talent when it came to riding a horse and in the Yhing hir culture, that is tantamount to being less than nothing. The Yhing hir prize their mounts above all things and believe firmly that a man without a horse is no man. Fearing that his inability to ride competently would doom him to a life of servitude, his mother begged an Ehtzara to help her boy. The night before his right of passage, the mystic gave his mother a magical bridle and by mid\u00acafternoon, Alwan was inducted into the tribe as an adult. Sadly, his mother could not celebrate with the young man, as the Ehtzara came to collect his due, claiming her as his new apprentice, just as they\u2019d bargained.

Once used, this ability cannot be used again until the next dawn. Boots of Balance Wondrous item, uncommon Description: These boots are made from glossy-black whale skin and are prized by duelists. History: The dueling schools of Savona have long been famed for their acrobatic and theatrical fighting styles, and thus an enterprising young crafter by the name of Ciro val\u2019Sheem felt it would be the perfect place to market his boots of balance. He found that the most respected duelists disparaged him; no one would rely on such a crutch rather than skill alone. Still, his boots were very popular among those who cared more about results than etiquette, and Ciro val\u2019Sheem died a wealthy man, even if he never had the respect he desired. Abilities/Effects: While you wear these boots you gain advantage on Dexterity (Acrobatics) checks.

History: The first of these boots were made famous during the early years of the Coryani Empire, when the famed warrior, Deveros val\u2019Assante, single-handedly quelled a revolt at the ancient walled city of Sulpecci. Reports vary in some details, but all agree that Deveros is said to have kicked in the sealed, barred and bolted gates to the city before cowing the leaders of the insurgency. When Deveros perished in a Voei ambush, his boots were lost with him. Since then, the boots have surfaced occasionally, before finally falling into the hands of Vespoltoc, a Tultipetan craftsman. Vespoltoc managed to determine that these boots were created in the lost dwarven enclave of Corett Palas, famed for creating exquisite and unique magical garments.

History: During the Imperium of Man, the secrets of these boxes were tightly held by the Pantheonistic Church, which used them to disenchant items that they considered cursed, heretical, or just too dangerous to be allowed to exist. With the fall of the First Imperium, however, these boxes and the secrets of their manufacture spread to become the bane of mages everywhere. While these items are not illegal to own, their use is widely despised by magical craftsmen across Onara. The Sorcerer King sees the very existence of these boxes as an affront to his magical power. He has instructed his minions to harvest anyone they discover with such a box, regardless of their magical ability. Abilities/Effects: Any non-artifact magical item placed within this box is rendered non-magical after one hour. Sentient items placed within the box receive no save to resist this effect.

He recently returned from a trading expedition to that island bearing a chest full of wondrous gifts. Amongst them were a dozen pair of bracers with a unique property. The Naori chieftain claimed that their god, a being that lives in the active volcano in the center of the island, empowered the bracers to protect the natives from the raiders that came from the \u201cblack ships made of stone\u201d. While the Naori consider the bracers to be a gift from their god, these mysterious raiders had not landed on their shores since before the chieftain\u2019s grandfather\u2019s time.

Bracers of the Thunderer Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement) Description: These are a set of golden bracers inscribed with the glyphs of the Storm Lord, Hurrian. History: During the Shadow Age, the lands that now comprise the war-torn lands of Almeric were crushed beneath the tyrannical heel of the Auxunite warlords. Resistance towards these oppressive tyrants created strange bedfellows. On such instance was the dear friendship struck between the Solani dwarf Entalwen and a monk by the name of Aidic val\u2019Tensen. Aidic belonged to a pacifistic order that refused to involve themselves in the rebellion, but the young monk could not stand idly by while his fellow man suffered. Entalwen crafted a magnificent set of golden bracers inscribed with the glyphs and symbols of the Storm Lord, Hurrian to aid him in his battles. Unfortunately, the bracers of the thunderer were not enough to save Aidic from the wrath of the mighty Warlord Khidath, who left the monk\u2019s broken body draped over the central gates of Nevanne as a warning to those contemplating further insurrection. In the dead of night, Entalwen snuck into the city and retrieved his friend\u2019s shattered corpse. Recovering the bracers, BRACERS OF THE THUNDERER he worked feverishly to recreate them and months later delivered twenty sets to Aidic\u2019s brethren in the Monastery of the Iron Wind. Eventually, a coalition of dwarves from Solanos Mor, the val\u2019Tensen family and the human populace of the region overthrew the occupying forces of the Auxunite Empire. Aidic\u2019s death galvanized the monks of the Iron Wind to action; they lead the rebellion against their oppressors at the cost of their lives. With their death, the Monastery of the Iron Wind faded from memory and with them vanished the bracers of the thunderer. Emerald Society scholars believe that the bracers are hidden away in some as yet undiscovered Auxunite treasure trove or within the lost monastery of the Iron Wind.

To this end, they crafted collars that allowed their male slaves to bond more closely to their \u201cpack\u201d.

The hinged lid has a mirror on the underside, and the exterior of the box is decorated with images depicting a harem of dancing girls. History: When the priesthood of Larissa first changed to embrace Her aspect of forbidden pleasure, there was much debate among the clergy. Even among those who embraced aspect, some thought it should be curtailed or tempered with her oracular aspect. Many of the younger followers of Larissa saw this as the doddering conservatism of old age, and they first created cosmetics of comeliness as a symbol of rebellion against the oracular establishment, as well as their embrace of Larissa\u2019s debauchery without reservation. As time went on this symbolic meaning of the cosmetics faded, and now these magical items are even carried by priestesses of the oracular school, albeit not frequently.

Once captured, a detailed illustration of the creature is displayed within the book as well as information about the creature\u2019s powers, weaknesses and equipment.

During the elorii revolt, the gauntlets were used to devastating effect, obliterating scores of their former servants. But it was not enough to overcome the overwhelming number of rebels.

History: During the Shadowed Age, Licinius Dovitoni led a group of bandits that terrorized the eastern coast of what is now the province of Cafela. Though the merchants and government officials offered hefty rewards for his capture, he became a folk hero to the people of Sulpecci, as he shared his ill- gotten wealth with the impoverished and oppressed. He was particularly popular with the itinerant priestesses of Larissa in the town, his good looks and charm making him welcome in Sulpecci\u2019s many brothels. During one of his robberies, Licinius attacked a procession of travelers and inadvertently killed one of the passengers. The victim was the High Priestess of Larissa, traveling from Savona to the outlying towns and settlements in the region. With her last breath, she cursed Licinius, forever depriving him of the Goddess of Luck and Beauty\u2019s favor. Instantly, the handsome young raider\u2019s body became twisted, with boils and seeping ulcers covering him. He fled wailing, knowing that his life enjoying the pleasures of the world were now denied to him. The years of living the life of a hermit slowly drove Licinius mad. In his lunacy, he wrote prayers in supplication to the Divine Harlot, pleading for Her forgiveness on small placards with strange figures on their reverse.

Others were found scattered across the cave and they were quickly collected and divided among the group.

Demonhide Cloak Wondrous item, legendary (requires attunement) Description: This crude cloak, repulsive to most people, is created from the uncured hide of an infernal. These cloaks vary as much in appearance as the creatures they are crafted from, but the one thing that remains constant is the general aura of malaise that surrounds them. History: The first demon hide cloak was created during the First Crusade of Light as trophies. The priesthood looked askance at wearing the skins of such abominable creatures, but it was not until over a century later, when the Inquisition found themselves with more power, that the Mother Church declared these items blasphemous and ordered them destroyed on sight. What was a symbol of opposition against infernals became a symbol of devotion, and the Seekers of the Hidden Master sought to save as many demonhide cloaks as they could from the Inquisition\u2019s cleansing flames. With the opening of the Sealed Lands, some infernal hunters have taken to crafting these items as trophies once again, as priests are reluctant to criticize the brave defenders at the Wall of the Gods. Abilities/Effects: While this cloak is worn you gain a +1 bonus to your AC and resistance against acid, cold, and fire damage. Additionally, you can use an action to cast fear (save DC 16). Once used, this ability cannot be used again until the next dawn. Devilskin Knot Wondrous item, legendary (requires attunement) Description: A devilskin knot appears to be a fist sized knot of tightly wrapped strips of black leather. Upon closer examination, the strips of leather are rough and pebbly, and seem to constantly strain against their current configuration. In actuality, the knot is created by flaying strips of skin from a captive barbed devil. As the final step of creating the knot, the barbed devil is imprisoned inside the item. The knot constantly writhes and struggles to undo itself as the infernal inside it seeks release. History: Not all the clergy of Sarish wish to drive the infernals from Arcanis. There are numerous practitioners of magic, including many of Sarish\u2019s worshippers, who take unholy glee from binding infernals to their will. The worst of these individuals, known as the Seekers of the Hidden Master, are located in the dark bowels of Canceri, where their twisted pacts with the infernals are smiled upon and encouraged. This secret society wishes to defy the will of the gods, and bring back the Devil- Kings of old, reinstating their rule over mankind as it was during the Time of Terror. Abilities/Effects: When this item is hurled at a creature the knot explodes into a flurry of tentacles, restraining the creature and sapping its life force. As an action, you can throw the knot at a creature within 30 feet of you. That target must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or become restrained as the knot wraps securely around it. As an action on its turn, a restrained creature may attempt to escape the knot by making a DC 15 Strength or Dexterity saving throw (affected creature\u2019s choice). On a successful saving throw, they escape the knot. If the target succeeds on their initial saving throw or later escapes the knot, it returns to you immediately, dropping next to you if you cannot grasp it. Once the knot is restraining a creature, as an action you can force the restrained creature to succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or suffer 2d10 points of necrotic damage. The restrained creature suffers 1 level of exhaustion for every 20 points of damage inflicted by the knot. If the restrained creature dies while affected by the knot, the knot immediately returns to your side. Whenever the knot deals damage to a creature, roll a d20. On a roll of 1 the barbed devil trapped within breaks free, destroying the knot. This barbed devil is an unbound infernal and is not under your control; it will attack you if n can. The knot has an AC of 20 and 20 hit points. It regenerates 1 hit point every 5 minutes if it has at least 1 hit point. If the knot is ever reduced to 0 hit points, it is destroyed. Roll a d8. On a roll of 1 the barbed devil is released as above. Diadem of Mental Clarity Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement) Description: These golden diadems are always set with one or more star sapphires. History: Karaz val\u2019Abebi was one of the greatest Altherian artisans ever known, and a member of the very Council of Wisdom that petitioned Althares for his First Gift. While his most famous works included the magnificent floating city of Khafre, he was a tireless craftsman who created many of what he called \u201cbaubles\u201d, which to any other artisan would be masterworks. One of these was the diadem of mental clarity. While the diadem was not as great a creation as Khafre, it was perhaps more significant. Several diadems were sold to others, and it was those wearing these diadems that saw through the network of illusions protecting Khafre during its construction and hastened its end. Abilities/Effects: This diadem has 3 charge and regains ld3 charges daily at dawn. If you expend the diadem\u2019s last charge, roll a d20. On a roll of 1, diadem crumbles to dust. .

Dimitri\u2019s Dimensional Doorknob Wondrous item, legendary Description: This plain doorknob, fashioned from brass, looks like any doorknob that you might find in any villa or manor home across the Known Lands. History: These doorknobs were first created by Dimitri Fealgren, a gnomish devotee of Cadic. Dimitri used the doorknob for several years to both steal money and food from the rich. Eventually, he perished when he carried a stolen bag of holding through the passage he created and was scattered across the Astral Plane. Abilities/Effects: As an action, you can place this doorknob on any non-magical wall. Once affixed, a standard sized door appears in the wall and can be opened as if it was a normal door. Once you walk through it, the door can be closed and the doorknob removed the other side, causing the door to disappear. If the wall is greater than 10 feet thick, opening the door reveals a 5 foot by 10-foot alcove or closet. Once you enter the alcove, the doorknob can be removed as normal, but the space created remains and can be hidden in. The alcove holds enough air for one Medium creature to survive for 1 hour. If an item containing an extra-dimensional space is brought through a passage created by the doorknob, a rift to the Astral Plane is created and the offending item, its contents and the contents of the passageway are scattered onto that plane. If the doorknob itself is placed into an extra-dimensional space, a rift to the Shadow Plane is created and the space, its contents, the doorknob and everything within 10 feet of the doorknob are sucked through into the Shadow Plane. Dolphin Tabard Wondrous item, rare Description: These tabards are embroidered with images of dolphins and decorated with gold trim. History: In the first centuries of the Coryani Empire many magical items were created for the Coryani legions, but General Maeda val\u2019Ossan found that few of these items served the marine tactics of her Legion of Naeraanth. With the outbreak of the Children\u2019s Crusade she was finally able to convince Empress Shar val\u2019Assante that new magical items were needed for her legionnaires. To assist the Legion of Naeraanth in its sea battles against the Black Fleet, the first Dolphin Tabards were created, bearing the symbol of the legion\u2019s dolphin standard. To this day, the Dolphin Tabard is a high honor granted only by the Dolphin Guard, the Milandisian successor to the Legion of Naeraanth. Abilities/Effects: While this tabard is worn you can breathe underwater and have a swim speed of 60 feet. Additionally, while openly worn you gain advantage on Charisma (Persuasion) checks made when dealing with citizens of the Kingdom of Milandir.\u2003 Doom Bell of Canceri Wondrous item, legendary (requires attunement to a location [building]) Description: These are large funerary bells crafted from a glittering blue-black meteoric ore. Each bell weighs over 500 lbs. and must be properly balanced and mounted on its wooden stand. History: As the Canceri insurrection against the Coryani Empire spread south, Milandisian legions stood against them in the Blighted Mire. In what the Dark Triumvirate regards as a miracle, a Nerothian priestess named Mohana val\u2019Mordane and her outnumbered Cancerese rebels stumbled upon a vein of meteoric ore in that swamp. Struck by a vision from Neroth, the priestess commanded her fellows to mine the ore, from which she crafted the first crude doom bell, which slew many of the Milandisians and forced the rest into retreat. To this day doom bells protect many Dark Triumvirate churches, and all are crafted from the ore found only in the Blighted Mire. It is illegal in Canceri for anyone outside the Church of the Dark Triumvirate to possess any of this precious ore. Abilities/Effects: This bell and its stand are a Large object and in order to attune the bell to a building you must place it on the roof of the building or in a bell-tower.

History: The Forsaken Wastes is a bleak and forbidding place, appearing at first glance to be completely devoid of life. Yet, within its scorched confines there are some nomads, ascetics, and wild wanderers who manage to eke out a meager and difficult life. They developed these bottles to defend themselves from the dangerous creatures that also pass through the Forsaken Wastes at times. Abilities/Effects: Each bottle of dust of ephemeral allies contains enough dust for 3 uses. As an action, you may pour some dust on the ground to create a beast or beasts as if you had cast conjure animals. After you have used the last of the dust, the bottle loses all magical properties. Dust of Mirages Wondrous item, very rare Description: A golden-cream colored glass bottle, shaped as a cat, holds this dust. When the stopper, which is the cat\u2019s head, is removed, a handful of dust streams into the air, creating mirages to confound the user\u2019s foes. History: Despite its modern origins, scholars debate who created the dust of mirages. Some claim the cat shape of the phylactery that holds the dust points to a Sarishan origin, while some suggest the Troupe of the Final Note or even the elorii. One thing they are quite certain of is that the gnomish mage Reatho Gromajj could not be the creator as he claims. Granted, he does always seem to have a ready supply of the stuff, and no one can remember the dust being available before Reatho began selling it, but most val and humans simply refuse to accept that a gnome could have created something so useful. Abilities/Effects: Each bottle of dust of mirages contains enough dust for 5 uses. As an action, you, can scatter a use of dust into the air to cast mirage arcane. After you have used the last of the dust, the bottle loses all magical properties. Dust of Size Alteration Wondrous item, rare Description: A plain leather pouch contains this dust. At first glance, this dust appears to be a dull grey, but upon closer inspection each grain of the dust randomly shifts in color between white and black. History: Tradition attributes the creation of this useful magical dust to Cadic himself. According to legend, while Cadic was attempting to woo Larissa he feared that her distaste for him would lead to rejection regardless of his music. Thus, he hid himself and began to play his enchanting song, but when she searched for the musician he used the dust of shrinking and enlargement to become small and sneaked away. After three nights of this Larissa\u2003 was so entranced by his music, and so longed to meet the musician, that Cadic revealed himself and his wooing of Her began in earnest. Abilities/Effects: Each pouch of this dust contains enough for 5 uses. As an action, you can sprinkle a use on a creature to cast enlarge/reduce (save DC 13) on it. After you have used the last of the dust, the pouch loses all magical properties. Dust of Warding Wondrous item, very rare Description: This slender ebony tube, carved to appear as a stretching demon, holds a single dose of this rare and powerful dust. History: This dust is rumored to have been created by the Order of the Emerald Flame under the personal direction of the Sorcerer King during the Time of Terror. Use of this dust provided wards against the infernals that conquered the mainland, leaving Ymandragore free of the fell creatures that the Sorcerer-King\u2019s own actions had unleashed. Regardless of the truth to that rumor, this dust is most commonly found in the employ of Ymandrakes. Recently, members of the Sanctorum of the Arcane managed to steal the secrets of dust of warding from Ymandrakes operating on the Pirate Isles. Since that time the Sanctorum of the Arcane has been able to create a small amount of this rare powder. Abilities/Effects: Each pouch of this dust contains enough for 1 use. As an action, you can pour this dust on an area or object and cast the antipathy spell (save DC 23) on it. This action takes 1 hour.

History: Many are the people that visit Sweet Savona every day, and deep is the intrigue that lies beneath the city\u2019s carefree veneer. Sweet Savona, so called for the ever-present scent of incense, is renowned for its festivals and dedications to Larissa, Goddess of Passion. Indeed, merchants, nobles, and peasants alike flock to the City of Joy to partake of its delights, pleasures and sins. Like all cities, Savona does have a business side. With so many visitors from across the Known Lands passing through its gates every day, it\u2019s na\u00efve to think the city is all pleasure and no work. Business deals are transacted in darkened warehouses or across tables in smoky tavernas. Because there is such high merchant traffic through the city, a few enterprising artificers began crafting small baubles to aid in these dealings. Abilities/Effects: While this earring is worn you gain advantage on all Wisdom (Perception) checks dependent upon hearing. As an action, you may focus your hearing on a particular spot you can clearly see within 30 feet. You can hear anything that would be audible from that spot as if you were physically there.

You can focus your hearing for up to 10 minutes. Once used, this ability may not be used again until the next dawn. Eelskin Cloak Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement) Description: Each cloak is fashioned from vertical strips of eel hide and lined with oiled sheep-skin for a modicum of comfort. Unfortunately, there is no way to disguise the rancid fish smell that lingers around the cloak. It is easy to spot someone wearing one of these cloaks, due to the conspicuous open space that surrounds them in crowds, rather than because of the cloak\u2019s unusual silver color. History: The precise origins of these cloaks are shrouded in mystery. They almost certainly originated with the Undir of the Western Lands, though where they got them none can say. Some scholars believe they were given these items as a gift by the elorii of Entaris, while others point to their legendary undine ancestors. Regardless, despite their smell, these cloaks are highly prized among Undir fishermen. Indeed, some Undir fishermen wear non-magical eelskin cloaks as a sign of their dedication to their craft. Such an act shows devotion to the sea above social niceties.\u2003 Abilities/Effects: While this cloak is worn you have resistance against lighting damage and advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks while under water. While wearing this cloak out of the water you suffer disadvantage on Charisma (Persuasion) checks and give advantage to anyone attempting to locate you though scent. Additionally, while wearing this cloak you gain the ability to cast the shocking grasp cantrip, using Dexterity as your spellcasting ability. Eloisa\u2019s Dancing Shoes Wondrous item, very rare Description: These black veldt shoes have a pair of green silk straps that tie up to the knee. History: Prince Rogan of Milandir, great-uncle to King Osric II, was known as a womanizer and a scoundrel. Despite his reputation, Rogan was at least careful to keep his trysts and sordid affairs out of the court, so as to not embarrass the other members of the Royal Family. However, one of these affairs became rather conspicuous. A young courtesan from Savona, Eloisa Gevane, caught Rogan\u2019s eye. The two began to meet secretly late at night as a playful tryst, but eventually fell in love. Unwilling to keep their romance a secret any longer, Rogan invited Eloisa to a ball as his partner and gave her a pair of wonderful dancing shoes made of the finest veldt and green silk. The reaction of the court was swift and unmerciful. Amidst shouts of outrage and derision, he and Eloisa were forced to leave the ball, shamed and humiliated. Abilities/Effects: While wearing these shoes you have a +1 bonus to you AC, advantage on all Dexterity (Acrobatics) checks, and advantage on Charisma (Performance) checks made while dancing. Everburning Coal Wondrous item, uncommon Description: This lump of coal glows red-hot without ever extinguishing or being consumed and is usually found in a tin censer. History: The first everburning coals were created by the Nierites during the Theocracy of the Cleansing Flame. To possess and carry one of these coals showed devotion to Nier and to the Theocracy. Conversely, those not possessing the coals were viewed with suspicion. After the fall of the Sword of the Heavens these items were treated with disgust, but soon enough their general usefulness won out. While some Nierites still carry these coals as signs of devotion, for the most part they are prized for purely utilitarian reasons, particularly among those who travel in the wilderness. It is rare to find a legion without at least a half-dozen of these items on hand to assist in rapid preparation of meals while on the move. Abilities/Effects: The lump of coal is carried in a small tin censer, and comes with a pair of small tongs sized to handle the lump. If the coal is handled with bare hands it deals ld6 fire damage. The coal sheds bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet and can be used to start fires. Eyepatch of the Corsair Description: This eyepatch is an oval piece of black leather secured to the wearer\u2019s face by long black thong. In the center of the patch are red glyphs that glow menacingly. History: The infamous Armind One-Eye sailed the Pale Sea in his ship the Corruptor for over two decades. Launching out of the city of Freeport, Armind plied his trade, cutting a bloody swath through merchant fleets and dragging the wretched prisoners to Garundi to sell for slaves. Armind\u2019s fierce countenance, scars crisscrossing his face and a ruined left eye, struck fear in the hearts of his enemies. In return for services rendered, Ymandrake artificers crafted an eyepatch to compensate for his loss. This patch and his bloodthirsty reputation as scourge of the seaways earned Armind his nickname \u201cOne- Eye\u201d. Abilities/Effects: You must wear this eye patch over an empty eye-socket to gain any of its benefits or use any of its effects. While this eyepatch is worn, you gain advantage to Dexterity (Acrobatics) and Wisdom (Survival) checks while sailing. As an action, you may cast fear (save DC 16). Once you use this ability, it cannot be used again until the next I 111. linglll. Eyes of Arcane Sight Wondrous item, very rare Description: These dark tinted lenses, set in an ivory frame, are said to have been created by Nurion val\u2019Assante.\u2003 History: The legendary Nurion val\u2019Assante created these lenses sometime after he had established the Sanctorum of the Arcane. Sanctums were often marked with arcane sigils only visible to those with the magical gift, as a precaution against the Harvesters. Unfortunately, this made it very difficult on Nurion\u2019s non-mage allies in the Coryani Senate, whose funding and support were desperately needed. To solve this problem, Nurion created these lenses. Nurion hoped his creation would bring about a closer understanding and kinship between mages and non-mages. In actuality, these items are most sought after by senators and other rich citizens to give to their bodyguards, to protect them from magical attack. Thus, they are often another sign of fear and suspicion against mages. Abilities/Effects: These lenses have 3 charges. While worn over the eyes, as an action you can expend 1 charge to cast one of the following spells, using your spell save DC detect magic, see invisibility, arcane sight. These lenses regain 1d3 charges daily at dawn. See Chapter Nine for the new spell, arcane sight. Fan of the Courtesan Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement) Description: Painted silk and stretched over a silver frame, this lustrous fan is in great demand in Sweet Savona. History: Originally crafted by the 5 th century Imperial Arcanist Ipicon, this fan was a gift to the legendary Savonan courtesan Sashastra. The truth of Sashastra\u2019s life is hidden behind a maze of rumors, half-truths and outright lies, but the greatest mystery remains her death. Any of her many lovers could have murdered the alluring courtesan, but many believe she was murdered by either His Holy Patriarch Cartalla or Emperor Lucian val Assante with the very fan that made her famous. Abilities/Effects: While this fan is held open before your face, you have advantage on Wisdom (Insight) and Charisma (Deception) checks.

Fan of Voice Throwing Wondrous item, uncommon Description: These paper and wooden fans, usually undecorated, are a commonlyemployed by many traveling performers. History: In the back-country of Onara, troupes of gnomish nomads often put on traveling shows for needed coin. They cannot perform in the big cities, where they are generally driven out of everywhere but the worst slums, but in the country they can sometimes find a sympathetic audience. Even here, though, it is not uncommon for a group of humans to turn hostile. In such situations, the gnomes will turn to trickery, and one of the tricks in their arsenal is the fan of voice throwing. Many gnomish troupe leaders carry such a fan, and are adept at throwing the right phrase to the right place in order to distract an angry mob long enough to pack up the wagons and escape. Tales of how these fans were first created are as varied and colorful as the gnomish performers themselves. Abilities/Effects: This fan has 6 charges and regains 1d4+1 expended charges daily at dawn.

Abilities/Effects: If you use an action to speak the command word and throw a figurine to a point on the ground within 60 feet of you, the figurine becomes a living creature. If the space where the creature would appear is occupied by other creatures or objects, or if there isn\u2019t enough space for the creature, the figurine doesn\u2019t become a creature. The creature is friendly to you and your companions. It understands your languages and obeys your spoken commands. If you issue no commands, the creature defends itself but takes no other actions. The creature exists for a duration specific to each figurine. At the end of the duration, the creature reverts to its figurine form. It also reverts to its figurine form if it drops to 0 hit points or if you use an action to speak the command word again while touching it. When the creature becomes a figurine again, its ability to become a creature can\u2019t be used again until a certain amount of time has passed, as specified in the figurine\u2019s description. Adamantine Ants (rare): These ants come in a small steel case which holds twelve half-inch long figurines. They can become giant ants that are each able to lift 35 pounds for 4 hours. You must activate all the ants of the set at once. Once used, these figurines cannot be used again until 2 days have passed. Adamantine Spider (very rare):) Originally the work of the Vyhrnil family of Capharra, this tiny figurine is in the shape of a spider with eight sapphires for eyes.

Making this shelter takes 1 hour. Once activated this figurine may not be called upon again until 7 days have passed. Bone Leviathan (very rare): This item is carved from the baleen of a whale. When placed in a body of salt water at least 1 mile across, it can be activated to become a baleen whale for 24 hours. This whale can carry up to 6 medium sized creatures across the water. You cannot control this whale, and it will not necessarily take the most direct route across the water but will not dive if it has creatures on its back. Once it has been used, it cannot be used again until 2 days have passed.

Once activated this figurine may not be called upon again until 7 days have passed. Emerald Hedgehog (uncommon): First created by the pilgrim Virega val\u2019Abebi during his travels in the Blessed Lands, this small item is carved from an emerald the size of a normal hedgehog. Each spine is individually carved and small black pearls are inlayed as its eyes. The figurine can become a hedgehog for up to 4 hours. You can command the hedgehog mentally and it has 3 charges. As an action, the hedgehog can expend 1 charge to release its quills in a 5-foot square. This 5-foot square is now considered to be filled with caltrops.

Obsidian Monkey (very rare):: Believed to originate from somewhere far to the south, these obsidian figurines were brought to the Known Lands by a crazed gnome who babbled incoherently about gigantic maze with people trapped and living therein. This figurine can turn into a baboon for 4 hours. The baboon has advantage on all Dexterity (Stealth) checks, and animates with a dagger that it somehow has proficiency with.

Once activated this figurine may not be called upon again until 2 days have passed. Fins of Yarris Wondrous item, very rare Description: These oddly shaped slippers flatten and widen towards the toes to a width of about six inches. They appear to be made from a very tough grayish leather of some unknown sea mammal. They smell of brine, and if someone puts their ear to the opening, they hear the sounds of waves. History: Officially these slippers were first created by the priesthood of Yarris within the Mother Church sometime during the Imperium of Man, and the scholars agree. Yet there are rumors. Rumors that these slippers were not created under the auspices of the Mother Church. Rumors that they predate the Imperium. Rumors that they were first crafted by humans who dwelled on Onara before the Pantheon of Man arrived, and yet nonetheless still worshiped Yarris. Rumors that those who frequently wear these slippers often simply dive into the waters off the coast of Salantis, and are never seen again. Strangely enough the few scholars who have ever given credence to these rumors have either immediately retracted their statements, or have been found to be heretics and liars, and swiftly silenced. Abilities/Effects: When worn and submerged in water, these shoes become flippers, giving you a swim speed of 60 feet. Additionally, you grow a set of gills allowing you to breathe underwater and you can see through water as if it were normal air. Lastly, you can speak with any aquatic creature as if you had cast speak with animals. Fire Beads Wondrous item, rare Description: Appearing as a common, unpolished bloodstone, this small scarlet sphere is warm to the touch. History: The first fire beads were created by the Order of the Emerald Flame for the Sorcerer King, and were used by Ymandragore during the Children\u2019s Crusade. The ability of even the most mundane Ymandrake troops to create explosions went a long way toward their initial victories in that war. As the tide turned, however, many fire beads were recovered by the Coryani. Once the principle behind them was understood, Coryani mages began creating them as well. Today they are found throughout Onara. Abilities/Effects: When thrown against a solid surface within 30 feet, these beads explode, forcing all creatures within 10 feet to make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 5d10 fire damage and falls prone, or half as much damage on a successful one. Fire Gloves Wondrous item, rare Description: These thick gloves are made from smoky-grey colored leather and are emblazoned with a fine tracery that mimics flames. History: Fire gloves were first created by Victus Publius, a Coryani battlemage, secret Nierite, and member of the Order of the Hidden Flame. For some generations, only a few pairs offire gloves existed, and only exclusively within the Order of the Hidden Flame. Then, after the re-integration of worship of Nier into the Mother Church by Emperor Calcestus val\u2019Assante, many \u201cworshipers of Nier in the Coryani Empire became public. In gratitude, they gifted the Emperor with five pairs offire gloves. The Emperor gave three as gifts to favored servants, but he had his artificers study the other two. Since that time, these items have slowly been becoming available throughout the Coryani Empire and beyond. To wear them is considered a badge of honor by Coryani Nierites. Abilities/Effects: These gloves have 3 charges and regain 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the gloves\u2019 last charge, roll a d20. On a roll of 1 the gloves lose all magical properties and crumble to dust. While wearing these gloves, you can expend 1 charge as an action to cast one of the following spells, using Charisma as your spellcasting ability: burning hands, scorching ray, Nier\u2019s blade. See Chapter Nine for the new spell Nier\u2019s Blade. Flagon of Conviviality Wondrous item, rare Description: A large metal carafe, engraved with depictions of the peace ceremony it was meant to commemorate. History: The first of these flagons was crafted in Solanos Mor to commemorate the one-hundredth anniversary of peace between the Solani and Encali dwarves. Since that time, replicas of the original have become a common gift of truce between nations and different factions. Many of these items can now be found amongst lost treasure hordes, sacked ruins and other forgotten places, as the flagons have survived the alliances they were crafted to commemorate. Abilities/Effects: If you serve wine from this flagon, all creatures within 30 feet must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or have their attitudes adjusted one step towards friendly. This effect lasts for 1 hour, upon which time the creature\u2019s attitude returns to its previous state. Flask of Verdant Glory Wondrous item, uncommon Description: This simple ceramic flask, engraved on one side with the holy symbol of Saluwe. History: In the fourth century Quintina val\u2019Dellenov, a priestess of Saluwe, disappeared in the Golden Boughs of Saluwe. She emerged from the forest\u2019s edgi months later, entirely mad. She carried with her the first flask of verdant glory. The details of her ravings remain a closely kept secret of the val\u2019Dellenov family, but her madness was declared to be holy, and the potion she carried with her was deemed to be a gift from Saluwe herself. Since that time flasks of the green elixir with its faint smells of mistletoe and honey have become so common that most priestesses of Saluwe carry them. Abilities/Effects: As an action, you can fill this flask with fresh, clean water or a vial of holy water. After filling the flask, you can drink it as an action to regain 2dl0 hit points. Once this ability is used, you cannot use it again until the next dawn. Garment of the Hidden Gift Wondrous item, rare Description: See below. History: For centuries the vile Harvesters of Ymandragore have hunted and collected people from the Known Lands who were born with the gift for arcane magic. The Sanctorum of the Arcane was founded to protect those so gifted, so that they might gather and train in safety with their peers. Still, the Harvesters have many means of detecting these arcane manipulators, and a mage outside the shelter of a Sanctorum can fall prey to their traps. As a further precaution, the Sanctorum developed the garment of the hidden gift. The garment\u2019s lack of any magical emanations shields the wearer from the scrying of the Harvesters. Abilities/Effects: This garment can be any article of clothing, from a scarf to a cloak. While wearing this garment, you are under the effects of a nondetection spell. Gauntlet of Immaculate Defense Wondrous item, rare Description: This single gauntlet is forged from metal plates, adorned with black crystals over the knuckles and forearms, and lined with fine black leather. Bound together by black chains, these gauntlets appear to be heavy at first glance, but are as light as leather gloves. History: The Legio Anguis Reptatus holds claim to the honor of having developed this protective item. However, they now see widespread use amongst the Coryani battlemages who serve within the mighty Legions of Coryan. Abilities/Effects: While wearing this gauntlet you gain a +1 bonus to your AC. Gauntlet of the Yh\u2019gi Wondrous item, rare Description: These heavy leather gauntlets are colorfully stitched and embroidered with images of soaring raptors. History: Kio are people of the sky; this is attested to in all their histories. While some may scoff at the idea of sky kingdoms, those who believe the fabled Kio homelands to be real hold up the gauntlet of the Yh\u2019gi as proof. According to legend, these gauntlets were not fashioned on Onara, but rather on the floating sky kingdoms from whence the Kio came. It is said that these falconer\u2019s gloves tap deep into the soul of a Kio, and that the spirit hawk they manifest is not a summoned creature, but rather the manifestation of a Kio\u2019s connection to the sky. The fact that non-Kio can still use these gauntlets does not seem to dissuade the true believers. Abilities/Effects: While worn, as an action you may call forth a spirit hawk. This creature possesses the regular statistics of a hawk and has resistance to nonmagical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage. Your hawk remains active until it is reduced to 0 hit points or dismissed as a bonus action. You cannot call forth another spirit hawk while you have one active. While you are within 100 feet of the hawk you may communicate with it telepathically or use an action to see though its eyes as if they were your own. While looking through your hawk\u2019s eyes you fail all ability checks based on your own sight. Once you call forth a spirit hawk, you cannot do so again until the next dawn. Gauntlets of Force Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement) Description: These heavy gauntlets typically consist of polished steel plates adorned with iron studs over the knuckles and around the wrists. Closer examination of the leather along the palms will show two designs, which form a complete Rune when both palms are held side by side. History: Helmut Steinhauer, or Helmut the Fraud as he was later known, first came to prominence in Moratavia in the ninth century. He claimed his life of asceticism and poverty granted him mystical martial arts techniques that allowed him to fire bolts of force from his hands, and he demonstrated this at small villages in the Milandisian countryside. He gathered followers among the credulous, none of whom he showed his abilities, but that did not stop them from signing over their possessions to join his \u201cOrder of the Joined Palms\u201d. As his reputation grew, however, those with more experience than Milandisian farmers quickly identified that Helmut\u2019s powers came from the magical gauntlets he wore, and not from any internal discipline or enlightenment. Helmut the Fraud fled with his ill- gotten wealth, but his gauntlets were left behind, and later duplicated by Milandisian artificers. Abilities/Effects: While wearing these gauntlets, you may fire bolts of force as a ranged weapon attack. You are proficient with these bolts of force which have a range of 20/60 and deal 1d6 bludgeoning damage. As an action, you may focus the power of both gauntlets upon a single target within range. If you hit your target with a successful ranged weapon attack, your target suffers 5d8 bludgeoning damage and must make a successful DC 15 Strength saving throw or be pushed 15 feet away from you and fall prone. Once you use this ability you cannot use it again until the next dawn. Gem of Sarish\u2019s Oath Wondrous item, very rare Description: This small green gem is marked with the holy symbol of Sarish. History: The first gems of Sarish\u2019s oath were created by Jarel, Master-Smith of the dwarven enclave of Encali. Jarel had long been fascinated with the swords created in the nearby enclave of Solanos Mor. He made a number of gems during his studies of the work of the dwarf Master Elebac, in the hopes that he might achieve a synthesis of gem and sword that would lead to the creation of the perfect item. Eventually, Jarel\u2019s jealousy of Elebac\u2019s skill consumed him, and after a botched betrayal of the rival smith, his fingers were permanently crushed by the Reavers of Bealak Gempor. Since that time gems of Sarish\u2019s oath have been created by Jarel\u2019s former apprentices, but none quite match the beauty of the originals. Abilities/Effects: This gem must be set into the pommel of an edged weapon, requiring a DC 20 Dexterity (jeweler\u2019s tool) or Dexterity (smith\u2019s tools) check. Once set, this gem cannot be removed. A weapon with this gem becomes a magical weapon. As an action, you may stare at an enemy within 30 feet and cut your own hand with this blade, reducing your hit point maximum by 4. You must also recite \u201cIswear by my blood and by Sarish that I will slay thee\u201d. This focuses the blade on your chosen target. Every time you strike a creature the blade is focused on, you deal an additional 1d6 force damage. You may not recover the any sacrificed hit points through any means or focus your blade upon a new target until your original target has been killed. Gerrard\u2019s Luxurious Pavilion Wondrous item, very rare Description: On the outside this pavilion appears to be a regular campaign tent and weighs 25 pounds. History: Gerrard val\u2019Ossan, a Milandisian court mage of some repute, was notorious as a seeker of comfort. Always looking for the easiest way to perform any given task and going out of his way to travel in the most comfortable way possible. When he was forced to go on campaign during the Heretic War, he developed a means by which he could enjoy the comforts of his extensive waterfront estate while in the depths of dreary Canceri. Many copies of this enchanted pavilion were commissioned by rich nobility since that time, who use it to flaunt their status. Abilities/Effects: By placing this tent on the ground and speaking the command word as an action, the pavilion assembles itself into lavish quarters within 1 minute. The interior of the pavilion consists of four 10-foot by 10-foot rooms, all of which are comfortable and dry, regardless of the weather outside. Each room is furnished with exquisite furniture and accessories (beds, tables, cushions, etc.), and any food stored within the pavilion is kept fresh while the pavilion is not in use. The pavilion has an AC of12 and 50 hit points. If reduced to 0 hit points, it loses all its magical properties except for its ability to be collapsed. Once collapsed, it cannot be assembled again for 7 days, after which time it recovers all its hit points and can be used as normal. Girdle of Marok Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement) Description: This belt is made from hundreds of tiny granite plates that are magically held together to form a band of moving stone. History: The elorii of Belestor crafted five great artifacts, one for each of their gods during the height of their empire. For Marok, the greatest Marokene artificers crafted a girdle that granted tremendous power over the element of earth. While only one such artifact was ever created, and subsequently lost in the fall of Belestor, it inspired elorii artificers to create the girdles of Marok in lesser imitation. Because the original girdle was lost during the Great Betrayal, these items became symbols of what the Elorii had lost to the humans. The Marokene who sacked the First City at the fall of the Theocracy of the Cleansing Flame wore girdles of Marok proudly during their inexorable march of vengeance. Abilities/Effects: While wearing this belt, your Strength score becomes 19. This ability has no effect if your Strength is already 19 or higher. In addition, while you are wearing this belt and in direct contact with the earth, you gain resistance to acid damage. Girdle of the Grand Gladiator Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunementj Description: This girdle is made of seven steel and gold alloyed plates, each embossed with scenes from the victories of the gladiator for whom it is made, and set with precious gemstones on a belt of mesh. This belt is truly glorious to behold. History: It was Carrok the Black, one of the greatest gladiators ever to bloody the arenas of Sicaris, who commissioned the first girdle of the grand gladiator, engraved with his many victories. Having won his freedom and his fortune many times over, Carrok fought for love of the arena. Fie was a larger-than-life figure, known for his grand theatrics and many public feuds and rivalries with other gladiators, prompting many grudge matches. When Carrok finally retired, one of the few gladiators to do so, others with the means sought to cash in on his fame by having their own girdles made, emblazoned with their own victories. It was these later gladiators that began the tradition of keeping and wearing the girdles of any opponents slain in the arena, thus ensuring the legends of the fallen would never vanish. Abilities/Effects: As long as you are not wearing any armor, when you wear this belt your AC is equal to 14 + you Dexterity modifier. In addition, you gain advantage on Charisma (Intimidate) checks while this belt is worn. Gloves of Arcane Manipulation Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement by an arcane spellcaster) Description: These plain and undecorated gloves consist of thin leather and seem to lack stitching of any kind, as if they have been created from the flayed skin of someone or something\u2019s hands. History: It is rare for a magical item to be created by someone without spellcasting talent, but such is the origin of gloves of arcane manipulation. Niloc of Semar was one of the most prolific archeologists, some would say tomb robbers, ever to be part of the Emerald Society. His many expeditions led to nearly as many near-death experiences. Finally, weary of constantly being a target for every magical trap devised by an ancient civilization, Niloc began a study of magical artificing to find a way to better protect himself. The result was gloves of arcane manipulation. It was not until long after Niloc had entered a Myrantian tomb and never returned that spellcasters discovered the gloves\u2019 secondary ability of storing spell levels, something Niloc\u2019s notes referred to as an \u201codd tingling sensation\u201d that would have to be \u201cfixed in a later design\u201d. Abilities/Effects: While these gloves are worn, if you are targeted by a spell that only affects you (not a spell with an area of effect) you may, as a reaction, gain advantage on that spell\u2019s saving throw. If you roll a 20 on this saving throw, and the spell is of 5 th level or lower, you absorb the spell\u2019s power into your gloves. You may use the absorbed spell\u2019s spell slot, instead of one of your own, for 1 minute. Once these gloves have absorbed a spell they may not do so again until the next dawn. Gloves of Shadow Storage Wondrous item, rare Description: These unremarkable gloves appear to be just other pair of well-worn gloves, except for the inner lining of the palm upon which is inscribed a unique glyph. History: First appearing in the Shadow Towns of the League of Princes, it is believed that these gloves may have been recovered from an ancient tomb or recovered ssethric treasure trove. Regardless, their clear utility in both larceny and espionage all but guaranteed their reproduction and sale by gifted runesmiths and arcanists alike. Abilities/Effects: While worn, as a bonus action you can store any item with a weight of up to 10 pounds in a small pocket in the Shadow Plane. You can retrieve this item with another bonus action. Each glove can only hold 1 item at a time. Due to the way these gloves store their items, these gloves may be safely transported through Ansharan portals or even stored extra dimensional spaces such as a bag of holding. Gloves of Skillful Manipulation Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement) Description: These fine gray gloves are crafted from the softest leather and cover the owner\u2019s hands to the wrist. The leather has been expertly tooled with images of exotic birds. History: First appearing upon the hands of Nedra of Old Coryan, the exact origin of the gloves remains a mystery. Some speculate that they were a gift from an amorous mage, while others figure they were a payoff from the same source. Nedra\u2019s own origins are also wrapped in mystery, but it is believed that the charismatic raven-haired beauty was born a street urchin. How she spent her early years no one truly knows, but by age 15, she had become one of the most feared members of Old Coryan\u2019s underworld. Nedra dealt in secrets and everyone has something to hide. She was somehow able to steal documents through windows no larger than the documents themselves. Even secure and locked chests were no obstacle. A blackmailer discovered that the padlock on his office chest had been picked, opened, and valuable documents stolen, all with no sign that Nedra had ever entered the room. Footprints were found at the window outside, but the window itself was far too small for even a child to fit through. By the time she was a young woman, her influence had grown to the point where Emperor Almeric val\u2019Assante offered her a position in the Imperial Court. Nedra was granted lands and title, and upon her deathbed she left all her worldly possessions to her daughter. The family fortune, including the gloves that Nedra so carefully kept secret, have been passed down through the generations. Abilities/Effects: These gloves have 3 charges. While worn, as an action you may expend 1 charge to conjure a pair of disembodied ethereal gray hands. These hands can appear anywhere within 30 feet of you and mimic the exact movements of your own hands; they even possess a sense of touch. You can perform any tasks or skills you could normally do with your own hands with the disembodied hands except that they cannot attack or lift more than 5 pounds. These hands have a range of 60 feet. The gloves regain 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn Gloves of the Diplomat Wondrous item, very rare Description: This item is an ornate pair of white gloves made from the finest calf hide. Patterned in silver thread with the symbol of Sarish, these well-crafted gloves cover the wearer\u2019s hands to wrist. Their true power comes into effect whenever the wearer is involved in a deal of a diplomatic nature. History: The first pair appeared in the early 11 th century on the hands of Rofel Ovidius val\u2019Mehan of Coryan. Rofel\u2019s sensible words and skills at oration allowed him to rise quickly through the ranks and gain a position of prestige inthe Imperial Court. Rofel\u2019s powers of persuasion were well known, and as a diplomat he had no peer. Emperor Aurelius appointed Rofel ambassador (diplomatic legate) to Canceri, a perilous post that he held for twenty years. Rofel did much to improve relations between the two col Soon after Rofel\u2019s death, these gloves passed on to a new ambassador, Asten Ovidius val\u2019Mehan. Unlike his predecessor, the young, and some would say naive, Asten quickly fell prey to the machinations of Cancerese politics and has been missing for several years. More recently, these or a similar pair of gloves have been seen \u201cV ^ A . \u0416* worn by a val\u2019Mehan emissary who was appointed a Coryanidiplomatic legate. Abilities/Effects: Any time you shake hands with another intelligent creature while wearing these gloves, that creature they must succeed in a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or suffer disadvantage on all Wisdom (Insight) and Charisma (Deception or Persuasion) checks for the next hour when dealing with you and your allies. If they succeed on their save, the creature becomes immune to the glove\u2019s effects for 1 year. Any creatures affected by the gloves must also make a successful DC 18 Intelligence saving throw to become aware of the magical influence of the gloves. If they fail, they are unaware of the gloves\u2019 effects. Gloves of the Mortis Ceres Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement) Description: These bone-white gloves, woven from thick strands of spider silk, come to just above the wrist. History: The first of these gloves were created during the height of the Myrantian Empire by worshipers of Mahememnun, the Myrantian god of the underworld. When the Second Crusade of Light brought the Myrantians under Coryani rule, these items were discovered by Ventakan Nerothians attached to the Legio Mortis Ceres. Realizing that the Mother Church would consider an item dedicated to a foreign god blasphemous, but not wishing to give up their extensive power, the Nerothians renamed them the gloves of the Mortis Ceres, and claimed to have invented the gloves themselves. Some of these Nerothians later returned to Ventaka, and in the modern day, it is these Nerothians and the priests of Mahememnun of the Abessian Dominion who continue to create the gloves. Abilities/Effects: These gloves have 3 charges and regain 1d3 expended charges daily at midnight. If you use the gloves\u2019 last charge, roll a d20. On a roll of 1, you gain 1 level of exhaustion and the gloves gain 1 charge as they pull upon your life force to power their effects. While these gloves are worn, you may expend those charges to use the following abilities. Feed upon the Soul: You may use an action and expend 2 charges to cast vampiric touch, using Charisma as your spellcasting ability. Power of Death: While casting a necromantic spell you may expend 1 charge as a bonus action to increase the spell level by 1. Feed upon the Dead: As a bonus action you may expend 1 charge to cause a single undead with a CR of \u00bc or less within 30 feet of you to be reduced to ash, granting you 10 temporary hit points. These temporary hit points remain for 1 hour. Gloves of the Scoundrel Wondrous item, uncommon Description: These gloves are made of soft and supple black leather that fits snuggly around the wearer\u2019s hands. The back of the gloves is lightly rippled, while the palms are smooth and easy to grip things with. History: These gloves first became known after a rash of pickpocketing and thievery in Savona. When the gang of thieves was rounded up, it was discovered that they all wore gloves that magically improved their abilities. Several curious artificers attempted to track the gloves\u2019 origins, finally finding the black-market dealer who had first sold the gloves in Savona. He said he had received them from a thief, but that thief was found poisoned. No other evidence was apparent, and the poisoning had all the signs of a professional assassination. Recently the Emerald Society has claimed to have found similar gloves in the ruins of the First City, identical to the Savonan gloves save for their age and the inclusion of an obsidian disk embroidered into the leather. Abilities/Effects: While worn, these gloves grant advantage on Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) checks and you may cast mage hand. Gris-Gris Bag Wondrous item, uncommon or rare Description: This woven satchel always seems to contain exactly what a hedge mage needs. History: The gris-gris bag is one of the oldest magic items known, perhaps as old as magic itself. When Sarish first gifted arcane magic to mankind, so says the legend, he gave its secrets to only a chosen few. From these few, five were chosen to wander the land and find other humans worthy of learning the secret power. They each created a woven bag and filled it with whatever useful and magical things they discovered on their journey. By the time their journey was finished, the bags had become magical in their own right. Though the original five bags were lost long before humans came to the Known Lands, their many imitations are still prized among hedge mages. Abilities/Effects: An uncommon gris-gris bag is considered both an arcane focus and a set of alchemist\u2019s supplies. The rare versions of these bags allow you to reach into the bag as an action and draw forth any uncommon or rare potion, or an alchemical item worth 100gp or less. This item must be used within 1 minute or it crumbles to dust. Once an item is drawn from the bag, you may not draw forth another until the next dawn. Hairpins of Prehensile Coiffure Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement) Description: These are two long-needle hairpins with enameled butterflies as handles. While worn, the wearer\u2019s hair grows into a thick, luxurious mane of hair that cascades in graceful curls to the small of the wearer\u2019s back. History: These pins were crafted by the Laerestri Osalikene mage Yanavalas as a gift to her longtime associate, a Larissan priestess whose long curls were shorn during an ill-fated excursion into Canceri. Upon her return to Savona, the use of stylish hairpins caught on and within a year, they were the height of fashion. To this day, it is impossible to find many prosperous ladies of Savona walking the streets with a mundane version of these hairpins. Abilities/Effects: This hairpin may be used as a magic dagger. While it is worn, you may use an action to cause your hair to grow out up to 10 feet in length and split into 4 independent appendages. These appendages remain active for 5 minutes or until they are reduced to 0 hit points. Once animated your hair may not be animated again until you complete a long rest. Your hair appendages are magic bludgeoning weapons with the finesse quality; they deal 1d6 magical bludgeoning damage with a successful attack. Additionally, may spend a bonus action to use your hair appendages while grappling, granting you advantage on all Strength (Athletics) and Dexterity (Athletics) checks made to establish or during a grapple. Each appendage may be independently targeted and has AC 14, and 20 hit points; they share all your other attributes. You may also use these appendages to perform delicate tasks, such as writing or picking a lock, but these actions are performed with disadvantage. Harness of Carrying Wondrous item, uncommon Description: This sturdy harness of tooled leather is large enough to buckle on over armor. History: In the sixth century Cael, the newest apprentice to an Encali master smith, grew weary of being constantly used for manual labor and forced to help merchants load crate after crate of her master\u2019s merchandise into wagons. Late at night, and cautiously so as to avoid being caught by her master, Cael created the first harness of carrying. When she defiantly used the harness during the next day\u2019s labor her master was impressed, and reassigned Cael to the workshop where she belonged. He also took credit for Cael\u2019s creation, and became a very wealthy dwarf. Abilities/Effects: While wearing this harness your Strength score is considered 4 points higher for determining what you can lift or carry. Harness of Hauling Wondrous item, very rare Description: This heavy leather harness is designed to fit around the front of a horse, but can be adapted to any other Medium or Large mount. History: Found by the Emerald Society explorers in the ruins near sunken Myrantis, it is believed that these harnesses were created by that ancient land\u2019s fell sorcerers. They speculate that it allowed their beasts of burden to move the immense black basalt blocks that make up the cyclopean ziggurats that dot that region. Abilities/Effects: A beast wearing this harness has their Strength score increased by 2, to a maximum of 20. If you are using the encumbrance variant rule, a beast wearing this harness can carry up to 10 times their Strength before being encumbered and up to 20 times their Strength before being heavily encumbered. Headband of Delusion Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement) Description: This headband is made of pyrite and studded with three pieces of quartz. History: The age of eloran rule was a time of great peace, but that did not stop Parados, an Ardakene priest, from seeing danger around every corner. His fellow elorii tried to soothe his paranoia, but over the centuries it merely grew stronger. He crafted many items for his protection, but few of them served any useful function. One of the few that did he called the headband of invincibility. He wore it everywhere, but it did not diminish his fears. He died before reaching his first millennium, slain by a bolt of lightning. His most famous creation is now called the headband of delusion, and has become a cautionary tale. Abilities/Effects: This headband has 3 charges; when the last charge is expended the headband crumbles into dust. While wearing this headband, you may use an action and expend a charge to gain a limited form of regeneration, healing 5 hit points of slashing, piercing, or bludgeoning damage at the beginning of every turn for 10 turns. Additionally, if you are ever reduced to 0 hit points or less you automatically succeed on your first death saving throw and regain 5 hit points at the beginning of your next turn. Headdress of Osalian Wondrous item, uncommon Description: A tooled midnight blue leather band, just under an inch wide, circles the head to form this headdress. From each temple, secured by metal clasps, are two feathers. The four feathers are taken from a crow, an eagle, a hawk and an owl. A blue jade talisman hangs over the forehead, depicting the face of an elorii. History: When Osalian was destroyed, those elorii who worshiped Him lost their divine connection and their spells. For Marithea, one of the most devoted and popular of Osalian\u2019s priesthood, this only increased her devotion to His memory. For centuries she toiled, researching arcane magic to replace the divine magic she had lost, but never failing to continue the rituals of her priestly service to her now-dead lord. Finally, she used her new powers to create the headdresses of Osalian, which are now worn by elorii who, like her, refuse to surrender their faith. Abilities/Effects: These headdresses possess 4 feathers. While wearing this headdress, you may use an action to pull one of the feathers out of the headdress and cast conjure animals, summoning the type of bird that feather was taken from. You can only have one bird summoned at a time and when a particular feather is used it cannot be used again until the next dawn. Holiday Hat Wondrous item, uncommon Description: Made from straw, and fitted with a band of bird feathers around the brim, the hat both shades the wearer and is stylish. Some hats have feathers solely from one bird, while others have a mixture. History: Kio tend to have fair complexions that are easily burned by the sun, so they took to wearing broad-brimmed straw hats to protect their faces while on journeys. Because these hats were often used by Kio on religious pilgrimages, they became known as \u201choliday hats\u201d. Most Kio own such a hat, but for Antarn Hallgyphe val\u2019Sungha this was not enough. She commissioned Phirae Veghellio, the famous Kio artificer, to enchant her holiday hat with further protections against the elements. Since that time Veghellio has created similar items for other Kio nobles, and the holiday hat has gained prominence in Kio fashion. Abilities/Effects: While this hat is worn you are not subject to the effects of weather. If worn while taking a short rest, you may recover 1 level of exhaustion. Once the hat\u2019s ability to recover from exhaustion is used it cannot be used again until you have completed a long rest. Holy Symbol of Rage\u2019s Fury Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement) Description: Crafted from the blood tinted gold of Canceri, this holy symbol of Nier seems to glow with an eerie crimson radiance and always feels warm to the touch. With its power, the possessor of the amulet may call upon the passion of the soul to ignite i heir Iuiy. History: First created by a priest attached to the Legion of Searing Light prior to Canceri secession from the Coryani Empire, the secrets of forging these amulets have slowly spread among the clergy of Nier in Canceri. Today, these amulets are given as awards of honor to soldiers who show bravery in battle. Abilities/Effects: While this amulet is worn you may use a bonus action to gain a +2 bonus to all melee damage rolls for 1 minute. Once this ability is used you may not call upon it again until you complete a short rest. Hood of the Cat\u2019s Meow Wondrous item, uncommon Description: This hood is fashioned from matted fur and has the texture of felt; it also has triangular patches that resemble feline ears. The color is usually black but sometimes matches the hair color of the crafter or intended wearer of the hood. The hood can be worn with a cape or other outer garment, and it is sometimes found with a cape of feline form. History: After Gilberta val\u2019Mehan refused the amorous advances of a powerful nobleman she found herself accused of witchcraft and consorting with demons. She fled to the Faerdwalden, where she intended to live a life of quiet devotion to Sarish. That changed when she found a badly injured cat at the edge of the woods. Then another. Then more. After nursing them back to health she found herself intrigued by the mystery, and calling upon Sarish\u2019s power she crafted the first hood of the cat\u2019s meow from their matted fur. What she learned from her feline friends led to her becoming the feared Cat Witch of Faerdwalden, who figures so prominently in Milandisian folk legends from the Shadowed Age. Abilities/Effects: As long as this hood is worn, you possess the ability to speak to felines as if you were under the effects of a continuous speak with animals spell. Horn of Saluwe\u2019s Bounty Wondrous item, very rare Description: Similar to its more common cousin, this ram\u2019s horn is gilded in gold and carved with images of bountiful harvests. History: These horns T. were also instrumental in lifting the siege of Panari during the Shadowed Age, when the fledgling Tenecian Empire sought to conquer the val\u2019Dellenov stronghold. Eventually, unable to starve the inhabitants into submission, the Tenecians returned to their lands, defeated. In the modern day, the horns are used to commemorate that ancient victory with an elaborate fete, where rich and poor dine at the same communal table, remembering the hardship their ancestors endured together. Abilities/Effects: If you speak a prayer to Saluwe and blow this horn you can cast heroes\u2019 feast. Once this ability is used it cannot be used again until 7 days have passed. Horn of Saluwe\u2019s Plenty Wondrous item, uncommon Description: This ram\u2019s horn is scrimshawed with images of menageries and gardens. The inside rim of the device is scribed with benedictions to Saluwe, asking for the blessing of her bounty. History: These items are usually crafted and used by the clergy of Saluwe to relieve areas that are suffering from famine or drought. When not in use, most of these horns are kept in the Temple of Saluwe in Panari. Abilities/Effects: If you speak a prayer to Saluwe and blow this horn you can cast create food and water. Once this ability is used it cannot be used again until the next dawn. Horn of Terror Wondrous item, very rare Description: This horn, carved from a large infernal\u2019s horn, is inlayed in gold and onyx. History: During the First Crusade of Light many infernal horns were taken as trophies, and those who took them were spared the wrath of the Inquisition because, separated from their host, they were believed harmless. It was not until the second century that Eligius val\u2019Assante, being a dissolute scion of the family with an unhealthy interest in infernals, dared to take his noble ancestor\u2019s trophy and subject it to magical experiment. The result was the first horn of terror. Few of these horns have been made, and if the Inquisition knew just what materials they were made from, they would certainly try to destroy them. It is said that when the last of the infernals have been vanquished that these horns shall crumble to dust. Abilities/Effects: As an action you may blow this horn to force all living creatures within 60 feet to make a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened until the end of their next turn. If you possess infernal blood (if you are a dark-kin, for example) the saving throw is increased to DC 19. Once used this ability cannot be used again until the next midnight. Horn of War Wondrous item, very rare Description: This horn appears to be made of a tarnished brass metal, looking as if it were partially made from a piece of charcoal. It can be worn slung over the shoulder on a leather thong. History: In the latter days of the First Imperium, val\u2019Virdan who specialized in working with war dogs, were known as the Hellhounds. One Hellhound, Cassia val\u2019Virdan, created the first horn of war so she could summon her beloved dogs to her side whenever she chose. To her surprise, her commanders confiscated her creation and told her to remain silent. Their reasoning became clear years later, when the Theocracy of the Cleansing Flame conquered the Imperium, and horns of war were used in the vanguard. These horns are still found among the Erdukeen. Abilities/Effects: As an action you may blow this horn to produce one of two effects. You may either summon 4 mastiffs as if you had cast conjure animals or you may choose to cast bless (no concentration required) on up to 6 friendly creatures. Once either of these abilities are used, this horn may not be used again until the next dawn. Horn of Winter Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement) Description: This horn is made of enchanted ice, kept perpetually frozen. The ice is as hard as steel, and is elaborately carved and embossed with images of mountains, glaciers and arctic beasts. History: The first of these horns known in modern times, and the template from which all modern horns of winter were created, was found clutched in the arms of a half-crazed pilgrim who came staggering out of the Blessed Lands. For years, its origin was the subject of much debate, but recent Azure Way efforts in the First City have discovered multiple ssethric records recounting battle with the Cyclopes and describing such horns. That, plus the strange writing on the original horn, point to a cyclopean origin. Abilities/Effects: While you are attuned to this horn, you gain resistance to cold damage. As an action, you can blow this horn to cast cone of cold (DC 15). Once this ability is used you may not use it again until the next dawn. Icon of Spirit Storing Wondrous item, legendary (requires attunement to a location) Description: These icons are crafted into various shapes, with the most famous being the leering skulls of Enpebyn. History: The largest collection of these icons located in the city of Enpebyn, until, during the Coryani Civil War, a large portion of the city caved in and fell into the Endless Dark and most of the icons were lost. Each icon represents a single creature and must be specifically made for each creature that is to be bound into it. For example, the icons located in Enpebyn contain the souls of the legionnaires of the Doom of Chendo legion. Abilities/Effects: These icons can be attuned to a location 1 mile in diameter and the ritual that attunes the icon to its location traps the soul of an intelligent creature within it. They are designed to fulfill a specific task, such as fighting a fire or defending a city from invaders, which is set when the icon is attuned. Once the specific condition set during the ritual is met, the icon summons forth a ghost which performs the specified task to the best of its ability. If the ghost is destroyed in combat, then the icon is destroyed with it. It is unknown what happens to a creature\u2019s soul when the icon is destroyed. Some conjecture that having served their time, they are admitted directly to paradise, bypassing the Judgement of Nier, while others claim that they are simply destroyed and do not even face the Judgement. The truth of what happens is liable to never be known. The icon itself can be of any size and can be destroyed as easily any item of its size and construction. Destroying an icon releases the soul bound within it. See Location Attunement Sidebar, pg. 103. Jar of Preservation Wondrous item, legendary Description: This thick glass jar comes with a lead stopper. The stopper for each jar is unique, and all bear a different glyph. This glyph is indecipherable, even by magic, and is presumed by scholars to simply be a marking to differentiate between jars. History: Recent findings by the Azure Way in the labyrinth beneath the First City have finally shed light on the origins of these strange jars. They were encountered by the Ssethregoran armies upon their defeat of the Issori. The Issori were attempting to preserve their larvae within the jars, presumably to resurrect their race at a later date. The Ssethregorans smashed all the jars they found and destroyed the larvae, but they soon learned to recreate the magic items for their own purposes. They remained in use throughout the Yahssremoran Empire, but the knowledge of how to make these items seems to have been lost with the rebellion of the elorii. Abilities/Effects: Any item placed within this jar enters suspended animation and will not age or decay. Only creatures or items of Tiny or Small size can be stored in the jar. If the jar is broken, anything within is freed and once again subject to the normal passing of time. Kirtle of Keepsakes Wondrous item, uncommon Description: Resembling the type of short coats that are typically worn under cloaks or robes, this magical garment has ten hidden pockets.\u2003 History: All Tevil the haberdasher ever wanted was to be respected in his hometown of Plexus. When he, almost by accident, created the first kirtle of keepsakes, he thought it might finally bring him the honor he wanted. However, few were impressed by what seemed to be mere sleight of hand using hidden pockets, so in frustration Tevil began embellishing his story. With each telling the tale grew grander, until Tevil was rumored to be a secret master of magic whose haberdashery was merely a disguise. Finally, he had the respect he deserved, but not for long. Being a rumored mage is a dangerous thing, and Tevil was harvested from his home one night. With no actual magical gift to bargain with, Tevil met his end at the hands of an Ymandrake interrogator. Abilities/Effects: This shirt possesses 10 cleverly hidden pockets. While worn you easily find these pockets, but anyone else must succeed at a DC 25 Intelligence (Investigation) check to locate them. Each pocket can hold one item the size of a potion vial, or you may split up one set of small tools (such as thief\u2019s tools) into 3 pockets. Lantern of Restless Warding Wondrous item, very rare Description: This hooded lantern is made from steel that has been plated with hammered white-gold sheets. History: After the Cult of the Thousand-Eyed Man arose during the reign of Eladru val\u2019Assante, the Inquisition realized they needed an order of elite inquisitors able to deal with the ghastliest of heresies. Thus, they founded the Praecelsus Quaestor Lumens, the High Seekers of the Light. Lanterns of restless wardingsNfztfz first created for these elite inquisitors, to illuminate the dark places and to ward against infernals. Since the death of Felician val\u2019Mehan the order has dwindled, and now numbers less than one hundred, while most of the lanterns have been lost. Abilities/Effects: When lit and the hood opened, this lantern sheds bright light in a 60-foot radius and dim light 60-feet beyond that. As an action, you may set the lantern down and pour a vial of holy water into the lantern to cast magic circle (affecting infernals, save DC 16), centered on the lamp. If you move the lantern, the effect ends. Once used, this ability cannot be used again until the next dawn. Lantern of the Archaeologist Wondrous item, rare Description: This large, bronze, hooded lantern is ornate, with an inscription etched into the inside of the lens hood. Bronze birds with outstretched wings decorate either side of the lantern. History: It is no surprise that these lanterns were first created by the Emerald Society, though perhaps the motives behind their creation is more curious. A particularly secretive sect within the Emerald Society sought to ensure that no spies could steal their discoveries, and so they created a vault protected by cleverly hidden traps and riddles in obscure languages. They then made the first of these lanterns to give to their inner circle, with the idea that only someone KELB\u2019BAKARI LIGHTS THE WAY WITH THE LANTERN OF THE ARCHEOLOGIST\u2003 with such a lantern could avoid the traps and interpret the riddles. So secure were they in this belief that they let other security grow lax, and they were soon robbed blind by a particularly skilled thief. Abilities/Effect: This lantern has 3 charges and regain 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn. While this lantern is lit, as an action you may use 1 charge to cast either comprehend languages or find traps with an area of effect limited to the area illuminated by the lantern\u2019s bright light. Larissa\u2019s Coin Wondrous item, uncommon Description: This is a small gold coin with the visage of Larissa smiling on one side and frowning on the other. History: When the first Fatespinner revealed herself to the Larissan clergy, they were skeptical. Clearly the Fatespinner had martial ability, and some skill with divine magic, but how could she prove that she was truly connected to the web of fate? The Fatespinner proposed a test. A gold coin stamped with Larissa\u2019s visage was brought, a skeptical Larissan called smile or frown in the air, and the Fatespinner manipulated the strands of fate to make it land accordingly. Time and time again she demonstrated this, finally proving her ability. The coin, so frequently subject to manipulation of the strands of fate, absorbed some of the Fatespinner\u2019s own power, becoming the first Larissa\u2019s coin. Abilities/Effects: You may flip this coin as an action while willing it to alter your fate. The GM flips a coin, with you calling heads or tails. The GM then makes note of the result without informing you. If your call was correct, you automatically roll a 20 on your next saving throw. If you called it incorrectly, you automatically roll a 1 on your next saving throw. Once thrown, this coin may not be used again until the next dawn. Laurel of Glory Wondrous item, very rare Description: This laurel wreath appears to be made of pure gold but is as strong as iron and very light. It may be worn alone or attached to helm. History: One of the highest honors that may be granted to a citizen of the Coryani Empire, the laurel of glory is awarded for acts of selflessness, and fearlessness in the defense of the Empire. Those who wear these laurels will find that they are given deference by both plebian and noble alike. Abilities/Effects: While this laurel is worn you gain advantage on all saving throws to avoid gaining the charmed or frightened condition. When while acting in the direct defense of the Coryani Empire and its citizens (such as fighting a foreign invader or defending a member of the senate from assassination) you may cast bless upon yourself as a bonus action. Once this ability is used you may not use it again until the next dawn. Duty Above All (Requires Attunement): Once attuned to this item you may not end that attunement unless targeted by the remove curse spell. You have advantage on all attack rolls made to directly defend the sitting Emperor of Coryan or a sitting member of the Imperial Senate, even when not wearing the laurel. If you ever attack (even unwillingly) the sitting Emperor of Coryan or a sitting member of the Imperial Senate you suffer 10d6 psychic damage and the laurel crumbles to dust. Legionnaire\u2019s Crest Wondrous item, uncommon Description: These brilliantly colored red crests are used to adorn the helms of Coryani\u2019s most dedicated legionnaires. History: The first legionnaire\u2019s crests were created not for the Coryani Empire, but during the latter days of the Imperium of Man. The Imperator commanded crests be made for each and every soldier in his legions, a staggering expense that only confirmed the decadence of the Imperator and sparked unrest among his people. When the Imperium fell, the crests became a symbol of the corruption of the old regime. All that were found were burned at the command of the Sword of the Heavens, and the few that survived the flames were lost during the Shadowed Age. The secret of their creation was rediscovered in the second century, and the crests are now a signature item of the Coryani legions. Abilities/Effects: While this crest is attached to a helm you are wearing, as an action you may cast enhance ability upon yourself. Once used, you cannot use this ability again until you have completed a short or long rest. Duty Above All (Requires Attunement): Once attuned to this item you may not end that attunement unless targeted by the remove curse spell. You have advantage on all attack rolls made to directly defend the sitting Emperor of Coryan or a sitting member of the Imperial Senate, even when not wearing the laurel. If you ever attack (even unwillingly) the sitting Emperor of Coryan or a sitting member of the Imperial Senate you suffer 10d6 psychic damage and the crest crumbles to dust. Legionnaire\u2019s Pin Wondrous item, rare Description: This pin is shaped like a falcon in flight. History: This is a pin granted to legionnaire\u2019s who go above and beyond the call of duty, risking their lives and exemplifying the ideals of the Empire.\u2003 Abilities/Effects: While this pin is worn you gain advantage on all saving throws to avoid gaining the charmed or frightened condition. Duty Above All (Requires Attunement): Once attuned to this item you may not end that attunement unless targeted by the remove curse spell. You have advantage on all attack rolls made to directly defend the sitting Emperor of Coryan or a sitting member of the Imperial Senate, even when not wearing the laurel. If you ever attack (even unwillingly) the sitting Emperor of Coryan or a sitting member of the Imperial Senate you suffer 10d6 psychic damage and the pin crumbles to dust. Lord Anesche\u2019s Bags Wondrous item, rare or very rare Description: These sets of bags, each weighing approximately 15 pounds, appear to be made of fine velvet, and are often crafted with an embroidered symbol unique to the owner of these bags. One of the set, known as the master bag, additionally has gold-inlayed rope to tie it shut. History: The first set of these bags was created soon after the Blessed Lands were re-opened to pilgrims. An enterprising merchant realized that, with these bags, he could keep most of his stock safely locked away in his wagon, while producing whatever items he wished to sell from the personal bag he carried. It did not take long for other merchants to seek similar bags, and then for smugglers and spies to see the possibilities. In the eighth century, a spy within Quron val\u2019Dellenov\u2019s palace used these bags to pass messages to a Khitani agent outside the palace walls. Since that time many nations have become wary of these bags, and have sought wards which disrupt their abilities. Abilities/Effect: These bags are always found in sets of ld6+l with one, usually the finest looking bag of the set, being the \u201cmaster\u201d bag. Each bag is roughly 2 feet in diameter at the mouth and 4 feet deep. You can reach into any of the bags and pull out an item from any bag in the set that is within 100 feet. If any of the bags are overloaded, pierced, or torn, it ruptures and is destroyed, immediately removing it from the set. If the master bag is destroyed all bags in the set revert to simple non-magical bags. The very rare version of this item shares all of the same properties as the rare version, but it has no master bag. As such, in order to destroy a set of these bags, every bag has to be destroyed. Lord Khidath\u2019s Guard Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement) Description: Inscribed with ancient Altharin writing, this Auxunite armor first appears as a wide golden collar that expands into light, flanged armor and helm when the command word is spoken. History: Worn by one of the most feared warlords of the Auxunite Empire, Lord Khidath ruled over large swaths of modern day Milandir. The Milandisians, led by the val\u2019Tensen family, attempted to assassinate their cruel overlord over a hundred times, but failed due to this armor\u2019s enchantment. Abilities/Effects: While this collar is worn, as a bonus action you may use the collar to manifest a suit of armor. This armor grants you an Armor Class of 15 + your Dexterity modifier (to a maximum of +2) and darkvision to 60 feet. This collar may be activated for a total of 10 minutes before the magic in it ceases to function. These 10 minutes do not need to be consecutive, but must be activated for a minimum of 1 minute at a time. Once all 10 minutes have been used the collar ceases to function until you finish a long rest.\u2003 Lyde\u2019s Veil of Persuasion Wondrous item, rare Description: This veil consists of a fine mesh of white lace attached to a comb headpiece. History: The sorceress Vorena val\u2019Assante created this veil as a gift for her sister Lyde, who had ambitions of becoming a senator. Lyde at first refused to compromise her ideals by resorting to such tricks, and with her own skill she became the first woman to serve on the Imperial Senate. However, her fellow senators treated her as a political prop, and gave no heed to a woman\u2019s arguments, no matter how sound. Thus, she remembered her sister\u2019s gift. For more than a decade Lyde val\u2019Assante was one of the most respected politicians on the senate, the veil ever present on her face whenever she was in public. More than once it was commented on that it always seemed to complement the dress she had chosen that day. One day Lyde val\u2019Assante disappeared without a trace. Her home was in order with nothing out of place, save one thing; her veil was nowhere to be found. Abilities/Effects: While this veil is worn you have advantage on all Charisma (Deception or Persuasion) and Wisdom (Insight) checks. This veil has 3 charges, and regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn. While wearing this veil, you can use your action to expend 1 charge to cast charm person (save DC 13) on a humanoid you can see within 30 feet of you. Maliar\u2019s Magnificent Laboratory Wondrous item, rare Description: At first glance this miniature house seems like nothing more than a well-made child\u2019s plaything. History: Maliar val\u2019Sheem, Mage-Alchemist of Milandir, built a laboratory on the shores of the Gulf of Yarris so she could complete her master work. No sooner had she begun, however, then her laboratory was destroyed in the conflict between Ymandragore and King Osric I of Milandir. Maliar was displaced and moved inland, but her second laboratory was destroyed by encroaching Yhing hir barbarians several years later, again destroying all her research. Spurred by these frustrating events, Maliar vowed to create a laboratory that no army could destroy. After more years of research, and losing a third laboratory to a freak accident, she succeeded in creating the first of her magnificent laboratories. Abilities/Effects: You can use an action to place this small toy house on the ground and speak its command word. This toy home rapidly grows into a 20 ft. by 20 ft. by 15 ft. tall one story building. You may also you use an action to speak the command word that shrinks the building back to it\u2019s toy size, which works only if no one is within. This small home consists of 3 rooms, one of which is a full laboratory that has alchemist\u2019s supplies, glassblower\u2019s tools, an herbalism kit, and a poisoner\u2019s kit. When activated, the building has a small door on the side facing you. The door opens only at your command. It is immune to the knock spell and similar magic, such as a chime of opening or skeleton key. Each creature in the area where the home appears must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 10d10 bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. In either case, the creature is pushed to an unoccupied space outside but next to the house. Objects in the area that aren\u2019t being worn or carried take this damage and are pushed automatically. The building is made of impossibly strong stone and wood. The roof, the door, and the walls each have 75 hit points, immunity to damage from nonmagical weapons excluding siege weapons, and resistance to all other damage. Mailer\u2019s magnificent laboratory can only be repaired by casting mending and expending a 9 th level spell slot, which restores the laboratory to full hit points. Manacles of Ymandragore Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement) Description: These appear like normal, heavy iron manacles, but glowing red runes appear when they are placed on any who can channel arcane power. History: When he withdrew to Ymandragore, the Sorcerer King crafted the first manacles himself. Knowing he would need servants beyond the pathetic wretches that resided upon the Isle of Tears, he sought out a powerful mage and lured her to his lair. As she prepared her spells to escape, he bound her in the manacles and all power fled from her. Recognizing the superior skill of the one who had crafted her bindings, she swore herself to him. He gave her the manacles, and declared her to be his first Harvester \u2014 or so the legend goes. Since that time there have been many more Harvesters, and many more manacles; both are feared by the mages of Onara. Abilities/Effects: When placed upon a creature, they instantly become attuned to the manacles, breaking any attunement that creature may have to other items. The attuned creature instantly loses 10 spell slots, and loses an additional 10 spell slots at the beginning of each of their turns until they have no spell slots remaining. As long as these manacles are worn, the creature cannot regain any spell slots through any known means and suffer 6d6 force damage any time they attempt to cast any spell or cantrip. Once locked, the individual who placed the manacles\u2003 on the creature may unlock them as an action with the use of a command word. They may also be unlocked with a successful dispel magic (treat the manacles as a 5 th level spell) or successful DC 20 Dexterity (thieves\u2019 tools) check. Mask of Death Wondrous item, legendary (requires attunement) Description: This alabaster stage mask is carved to look like death\u2019s head, carved flesh stretched taut over the bones of the lurid and hungry grin of the skull beneath. There is a black coif that attaches by small silver clasps to the back of the mask, covering the entire head. History: The tales told about Drusilla val\u2019lVlordane are more legend than history. It is said Neroth blessed her birth, but Cadic\u2019s Troupe of the Final Note held her devotion. She was a musician of unparalleled skill, but her tunes were melancholy and the alabaster death mask she wore hid her features. It was she who played for the court of Eladru val\u2019Assante the very night three of his advisors were found dead, with evidence of their planned treason against the Emperor on their corpses. Her mask has seen use by the Troupe since her time, on rare missions of vital importance. It is unknown how many such masks the Troupe possesses. Abilities/Effects: This mask has 3 charges and regains 1d3 expended charges daily at midnight. If you expend the mask\u2019s last charge, roll a d20. On a roll of 1 you suffer 1 level of exhaustion and the mask regains 1 expended charge as it greedily feeds upon your life force. While this mask is worn, you may use an action and expend 1 or more charges to cast following spells: fear (1 charge, save DC 15), finger of death (2 charges, save DC 16). Mask of Larissa\u2019s Blessing Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement) Description: This mask appears as a solid gold mask carved with fine facial features. The left eye opening is surrounded by deep purple gemstone inlays reminiscent of tears, while a sunburst is etched about the right. Upon the burnished forehead is a glyph of pure silver. The mask covers the wearer\u2019s entire face, even her mouth, where perfectly formed full lips are crafted into a petulant pout. History: The first of these masks was created and worn by Serena Jiuldan of Sweet Savona, a high priestess of Larissa. She served for many years in the temple to Larissa, leading a relatively peaceful, yet intrigue ridden, life. In her early thirties, Serena organized a caravan to Mil Takara to purchase rare herbs and compounds found nowhere else in the Known Lands. The purchase went smoothly, and the priestesses of Larissa left Mil Takara with mules laden with the precious herbs. During the return trip to Sweet Savona, a band of thieves and cutthroats descended upon the sleepy caravan. Shouts went up from sentries, and soon the entire camp was in chaos. Brigands were everywhere looting treasure and taking slaves. The numbers were overwhelming, and soon the thieves had ringed the last tent, where Serena stood bravely at the head of her fellow priestesses. Serena looked out in dismay at the crowd of drooling savages, and raised her arms to the heavens. Calling upon the will of Larissa, Serena cursed the brutal raiders for their greed and savagery. Taking the golden mask from her face, she threw it into the dust before the brigands. In a booming voice, she cried out \u201cLeave this place now you fools, or suffer the wrath of the gods for your greed\u201d, and with that the head priestess of Larissa slumped to the ground in exhaustion. The bloodthirsty marauders laughed at the priestess and then turned their gaze upon the solid golden mask. As one they surged forward, intent on finishing off\u2019 the survivors, and plunder their riches. As the first bandit reached the mask, there was a roar of thunder and a brilliant flash of light. A smoking hole appeared where the raider had stood. Seeing this, the raiders turned to flee, but it was too late. Soon the entire valley was lit with coruscating bolts of lightning. The raiders were incinerated where they stood, as the divine power of Hurrian reached down to protect His sister\u2019s devoted followers. The priestesses quickly packed their scattered supplies and fled. No one, not even Serena, dared to retrieve the mask of Larissa\u2019s blessing which lay upon the ground. Abilities/Effects: While you wear this mask your Charisma score is increased to 19. If you already possess a Charisma of 19 or greater you gain no benefit. Additionally, while you wear this mask, you may cast augury at will. You do not require material components to cast this spell. You may, as an action, cast this mask to the ground and gain 1 level of exhaustion to cast call lightning (save DC 17).\u2003 Mask of Steely Countenance Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement) Description: This is a full mask of silver-etched ivory carved to resemble an expressionless face. The mask is tied with a simple cord of homespun wool, dyed a deep red. The interior of the mask is covered in prayers, in sepia-ink, dedicated to Hurrian. History: When Milandir left the Coryani Empire, the val\u2019Tensen family was split down the middle. To secure the border, Augustos val\u2019Tensen, newly made Duke of Moratavia, had to hold off his former brethren. But his counterpart in Ulfila had the friendship of the Larissan temple, who sent him oracles to predict Duke Augustos\u2019 actions. In desperation, the Duke turned to the loyal Milandisian priesthood of Hurrian, who crafted blank masks for the Duke and his officers to wear to hide their plans. With this new advantage the Coryani were driven back and the border secured. Abilities/Effects: While wearing this mask, you are permanently under the effects of a nondetection spell. You also gain advantage on all saving throws against effects that read your mind or discern your emotional state. Finally, anyone attempting to discern your motives through the use of a Wisdom (Insight) check does so at disadvantage. Mask of the Petrified Goddess Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement) Description: This is an oval mask carved from greenstone in the visage of a horrible, scowling medusa. It is adorned with burnished coral, a bundle of emerald serpents for hair and a golden circle set with glittering jewels upon its brow. When the mask is donned it becomes pliant and fleshy, hugging the wearer\u2019s face as the serpent locks transform into living snakes and begin to writhe and hiss menacingly. Rumor holds that this item was first created by the diabolical priestess Amedhi-Gesu. History: There are no records of these masks before the Blessed Lands were reopened in the early days of the Coryani Empire, and even since then they are rarely found, and always in the southeast of the Blessed Lands near the petrified forest. Local tribes speak of men who go mad and flee into the forest, only to return months or years later wearing a mask and embarking on some terrible, destructive purpose. In recent years an old Erdukeen, who had marched with the Sword of the Heavens into the Blessed Lands, donned a magical mask of his own creation, killed twelve people, and petrified another before he was put down. His mask was identical to the ones found near the Petrified Forest, down to the intricately carved snakes. Abilities/Effects: While wearing this mask you can animate the snakes on the mask as a bonus action and use them to make melee weapon attacks, treating them as magical daggers. Those bitten by the snakes must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned for 1 minute. Additionally, while worn you may use an action to can cast flesh to stone (save DC 15). Once this ability is used it cannot be used again until the next dawn. Mask of the Voei Witchdoctor Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement) Description: These masks are elaborately carved to appear as fiendish creatures of nightmare. Typically, they are carved from tree bark or stone, although the witchdoctors of the larger tribes have been known to craft them from pure fervid ite. History: Within a decade of the conclusion of the second Coryani-Khitani war, the Voei had grown even more aggressive, and survivors reported their warped barbarians were now led by masked witchdoctors. It is believed that the Voei recovered magic items from the battlefields of the war and, despite their savagery, were able to gain a crude understanding of their workings. They then turned this knowledge to their own purposes, and created the masks of the Voei witchdoctor. The pilgrims of the Blessed Lands mutter that this is just one more consequence of the schism between the nations of Man. Abilities/Effects: While you wear this mask you gain advantage on all Charisma (Intimidation) checks. This mask has 3 charges, and regains ld3 expended charges daily at midnight. As an action, you may expend 1 or more charges to cast one of the following spells: bane (1 charge, save DC 15), bestow curse (2 charges, save DC 15). Mirror of Minions Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement to a location [room]) Description: This large oval glass mirror is set into a silver stand. The two upright poles that support the mirror are cunningly worked to resemble a stylized man and woman, holding it at waist height. History: The first of these were commissioned by Emperor Quron val\u2019Dellenov for his Palace of Mirrors. The palace was built during the months leading up to the insurrection that saw Canceri, Milandir and Altheria secede from the Empire. By the time the palace was finished, Emperor Quron had already been executed and replaced. However, it was too late; his madness had cost the Empire dearly. The palace was abandoned and overrun by squatters before being partially gutted by fire in 905 I.C. Most of the mirrors were destroyed either by the squatters or the fire, but some precious few survived. Abilities/Effects: This mirror can be attuned to any room of no more than 100 square feet. Once the mirror is attuned, you can use an action to look into the mirror causing it to produce 8 illusionary doubles that last for 1 hour. The duplicates move with you and mimic your actions, shifting position so it\u2019s impossible to track which image is real. You can use your action to dismiss 1 or more of the illusory duplicates. As long as you have at least one illusory duplicate remaining, each time a creature targets you with an attack, determine randomly whether the attack instead targets one of your duplicates. A duplicate\u2019s AC equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier. If an attack hits a duplicate, the duplicate is destroyed. A duplicate can be destroyed only by an attack that hits it. It ignores all other damage and effects. The effect ends when all duplicates are destroyed. A creature is unaffected by this effect if it can\u2019t see, if it relies on senses other than sight, such as blindsight, or if it can perceive illusions as false, as with truesight. Once this ability is used, the mirror cannot be used to create these illusionary doubles until the next dawn. See Location Attunement Sidebar, pg. 103. Missive Wondrous item, uncommon Description: This delicate construct is made of cloth and wood, and is used by divine spellcasters as a means of sending messages or magical aid to distant fellows. They are often used to link the sanctums of the various cults and temples in the Blessed Lands. Superficially, the missive resembles a bird or bat and is usually painted with its creator\u2019s symbol of faith. History: The first missive was created by Fotini val\u2019Abebi in the latter days of the Imperium, just in time to assist in coordinating evacuation as the fabled civilization fell. During the Shadowed Age the Altherians kept the secret of the construct, using it among themselves. As they began to build their nation, networks of missives were established to foster communication. It is said that the skies above Khafre swarmed with them. Afterwards use of missives diminished, as Altherians sought for a time to be less ostentatious with their technological wonders, but they are still frequently used in the Shining Patrol. In addition, a number of missives were gifted to the Mother Church for use in the Blessed Lands. Abilities/Effects: Commonly dormant, the missive awakens when a divine spellcaster touches it and expends a spell slot, channeling the energy of the spell into animating the small construct. Once animated, any time within the next hour you may give the small construct a set of simple instructions and place a package in its storage container. You must send the construct to a location it has been to before and you must describe who to deliver the message or package too. The construct will do its best to fulfill your instructions, unerringly returning to you after completion. If the missive is unable to meet with your instructions, it will also return to you and tell you why it was unable to fulfill its instructions. Regardless of its success or failure once the missive returns to you it goes dormant once more. Secure Storage: A missive has a small container built into it, a few cubic inches in volume, which is able to carry a few ounces of messages or cargo, such as a potion or a scroll. More weight will prevent the construct from flying. If the missive is ever captured by a third party, it may choose to destroy any non-magical item within its compartment as a reaction. Mockingbird Collar Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement) Description: This is a braided leather choker with a mockingbird feather at its center. History: Iona of Plexus loved Florine, but Florine was married to the powerful and cruel Phocas Servius, who kept Florine imprisoned under guard. Iona crafted the mockingbird collar to allow her to imitate Phocas\u2019s bellow when she stole into Florine\u2019s room. She would then order that the guards not to disturb them in Phocas\u2019s voice. Thus, they were able to spend precious moments together, whispering words of love and planning their escape. Sadly, Phocas discovered their plans, and murdered Florine in a jealous rage. In despair Iona threw herself into the Gulf of Coryan and drowned. Her mockingbird collar later washed up on shore, where it was recovered, studied, and duplicated by others. Abilities/Effects: While this collar is worn you gain the ability to imitate the voice of anyone you have heard speaking. Tuning the collar to a particular voice requires an action. Once tuned, for the next hour, your voice sounds identically to the voice you chose to emulate. This grants you advantage on all Charisma (Performance) checks while attempting to disguise yourself as the person whose voice you are imitating. Monkey Gloves Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement) Description: These well-crafted gloves are made from spider-monkey hide. The hide is still covered in fine black hairs. The palms of the gloves are made from dark, padded leather that fits snugly to the wearer\u2019s hands. History: Vita Flavius claimed to have bought these gloves from a merchant, who had in turn bought them from natives in the Corlathian Mountains, who had in turn found them in the lost city of Mattawab. In reality, Vita, a skilled artificer, had crafted the gloves herself. However, it was her passion to discover the lost city, and selling the gloves was her best chance of financing an expedition. Few scholars of note believed her story of the origin of these items, but they were useful enough that she was able to finance her dream. The expedition, and Vita, were never heard from again. Abilities/Effects: While these gloves are worn you have a climb speed equal to your normal speed. In addition, you can use your reaction when you fall to reduce any falling damage you take by an amount equal to five times you character level. Monster Whistles Wondrous item, rarity varies Description: These items appear to be small folk charms on leather thongs or slim chains, but closer inspection reveals that they are actually whistles. History: The four spellcasters that became the Whistling Company first met in the Free City of Blackwand. They wished to become adventurers, but their lack of fighting skill concerned them. They found a solution in the market, where an Undir was\u2003 selling hand-carved whistles shaped like various creatures. Pooling their magical knowledge, the four were able to enchant these whistles into summoning charms, and for years the Whistling Company had many adventures. After the two surviving members retired they sold the whistles, which have become popular in the private garrisons of noble houses for their ability to simultaneously summon help and raise the alarm. Abilities/Effects: These whistles are small enough to fit in your pocket. You can use an action to blow one of them and cast conjure animals. The creature or creatures you summon is determined by the specific whistle. Once used, these whistles regain the ability to summon forth their bound spirits after 7 days have passed. Azure Lizard, (uncommon): This bright-blue ocarina is shaped like a lizard. When blown its sharp staccato call summons 8 giant lizards. Bird of Omens (uncommon): This short, squat flute is made from mahogany. When blown, it creates a sharp, squawking call that summons 8 swarms of ravens. Blood Wing (rare): This sinister looking charm is made of blood-red cypress wood with a long, thin proboscis that serves as a mouthpiece. When sounded, it makes a strange, echoing buzzing noise that summons 8 striges. Glistening Crawlers (uncommon): This wormwood flute is carved with coiling centipedes along its length and is lacquered to a warm color. When blown, it produces a deep, earthy tone which summons 4 swarms of insects. Grim Hounds (rare): This flute is made of ash and yew which are molded together to form the shape of a baying hound. This flute produces a mournful howl when blown, summoning 8 mastiffs. Iron Eater (rare): This iron-wood penny whistle is carved into the shape of a hump-backed quadruped with a propeller tail and long feelers. When blown, it produces an off-key sound that clashes with itself which summons 4 rust monsters. Marrow Men (rare): This macabre flute is carved from a human tibia. The bone is stained with dried blood and produces a shallow, haunting tune which summons 8 zombies. Silken Spinner (uncommon): This intricate and graceful ocarina is made from polished silkwood shaped as a spider. When blown, it resounds with a tinkling whispery tune which summons 2 giant spiders. Necklace of Beroe Wondrous item, rare Description: Seven turquoise and aquamarine plates, each engraved with breaking waves, are set into a steel and cobalt alloyed chain. Each link of the chain is shaped like the shell of a sea-creature. History: Valanos created the first necklace of Beroe in pale imitation of one of the five great elorii artifacts in Belestor. Many Berokene wore them as signs of devotion, and after the fall of Belestor and the loss of the great artifacts the necklaces continued to be worn in remembrance. The Berotar of Entaris, in particular, prize these necklaces highly. No necklace has ever been given willingly to outsiders, and most Berokene consider the wearing of these items by humans to be an affront worthy of death. Abilities/Effects: While worn underwater you can breathe normally as if you were under the effects of a water breathing spell and you gain a +1 bonus to your AC. Speak with Her Children (Requires Attunement): You can only attune to this item if you are a Berokene elorii. You can communicate with any creature native to lakes, rivers, or oceans as if you were constantly under the effects of a speak with animals spell. In addition, while in or near a body of water, you can use your action to cast conjure animals, summoning aquatic creatures only. Once you use this ability, you cannot use it again until the next dawn. Necromantic Shroud Wondrous item, legendary (requires attunement) Description: This funeral shroud is embroidered in barely visible spider silk with hundreds of tiny magical glyphs. History: Tasia val\u2019Mordane, a Coryani Nerothian, spoke passionately against the Cancerese rebellion. Despite this, she barely escaped from an angry anti-Nerothian mob that burned her home and killed her spouse and daughter. Enraged by this injustice, she made her way north to Canceri, bearing her dead child on her back. The Cancerese were loath to trust such an outspoken opponent of the Dark Triumvirate, so to prove that she had truly turned\u2003 against the Coryani she created the first necromantic shroud from the funeral wrappings of her daughter and personally presented it to the Dark Apostate. Many Cancerese temples of Neroth now have a shroud on hand, though they are considered illegal and heretical by most other nations. Abilities/Effects: When you place this shroud over a freshly deceased corpse, it rises as a ghoul under your control after 1 minute. You may control up to 5 ghouls at any one time; any additional ghouls created are not under your control. You can control ghouls raised with the shroud as if you created them with create undead but they do not count against any limits for controlling undead with that spell. The shroud is easily destroyed; it possesses AC 10 and 10 hit points. If destroyed, all ghouls it created are set free from your control. Needle of Mending Wondrous item, uncommon Description: This needle appears to be a simple copper needle with several tiny glyphs etched into it. History: Found throughout the Coryani Empire, these items are prized by surgeons, soldiers, and tailors everywhere. Originally created by clerics of Beltine for simple household tasks, the secret of their creation has spread, and they are now common household items in the richest sections of all major cities. Centurions quickly discovered how useful a Needle of Mending could be - from darning socks, to repairing armor or quickly sewing shut a comrade\u2019s wounds. As their reputation spread, so did their abundance. Now many field medics make this item a standard part of their healer\u2019s bag. Every legionnaire that can afford it owns one of these magical needles. Abilities/Effects: You may spend 1 minute working with this needle to repair any ripped or torn object made of cloth, leather, or similar substance as if you had cast the mending cantrip. You may also use the needle while taking a short rest to heal one creature of 2d8 hit points of damage. Once this ability is used, it cannot be used again until the next dawn. Nier\u2019s Heart Wondrous item, rare Description: These pins are made from a fire opal, a gem said to be the eggs of salamanders that glow with an inner fire. History: Many were surprised when Arthmoor val\u2019Virdan, rather than a more martial Nierite, was selected to be the first Dark Apostate of Canceri. Those who chose him, however, knew that his religious fervor and political acumen were what they needed. Arthmoor\u2019s religious training included divine magic, and in his younger days he had created these pins from fire opals. When he became Dark Apostate he bestowed the items as honors for those who had served Canceri loyally. During their occupation, the Swords of Nier confiscated some of these pins for their own troops, and now the pins are considered awards of honor in both militaries. Abilities/Effects: While wearing this pin, you have advantage on all saving throws against spells or effects which deal fire damage. Sword of my Lord (Requires Attunement): You may only attune to this item if you are a worshipper of Nier. While wearing this pin, you can use an action to cast either flame blade or Nier\u2019s blade, regaining the ability to do so daily at daw ii. See Chapter Nine for the new spell, Nier\u2019s Blade. Olymed\u2019s Armband of Ever-Ready Blades Wondrous item, rare Description: This armband is made from twisted strands of gold and engraved with symbols of strength and alertness. This armlet is worn around the bicep and is often kept in full view by proud dwarven warriors. Intricate golden charms hang from the armlet, up to six in total, each a minute yet perfect representation of a weapon. History: Created by the dwarven weapon master, Olymed, these bracelets are a boon to any warrior caught without a weapon or forced to leave their favorite sword at the tavern door. Olymed, a successful dwarven craftsman from Solanos Mor, became widely known for the quality of his creations sold throughout Marketplace, the large bazar situated at the foot of the mountain that houses the Solani enclave. Abilities/Effects: When worn, as an action you can transform any weapon you hold with a weight of 20 lbs. or less into a small charm which hangs upon this armband. While in this form, any ability that weapon possesses is inactive. Up to 6 weapons may be stored this way, and weapons with ammunition share a slot with their ammunition, such as a bow and a quiver of arrows. You can summon a stored weapon back to your hands as a bonus action, with ammunition appearing either on you or next to you. If the armband is targeted by a dispel magic spell, all the weapons that are charms instantly appear at your feet. If the armband is ever destroyed, roll a d4 for each weapon. On a 1 that weapon is destroyed. On any other result the weapon appears at your feet. Orb of Lore Wondrous item, very rare Description: This fist-sized sphere of dark blue crystal is highly sought after by scholars and sages. History: Allathan val\u2019Abebi was a great artificer who helped construct the flying city of Khafre. While others worked on the structure, he crafted artifacts within the city. His crowning achievement was the great orb of lore, a repository of knowledge and prophecy that, so said Allathan, would ensure the Altherians would always be the most advanced people in the world. Like Khafre itself, the orb was a symbol of Altherian hubris, and when the city crashed it shattered in an explosion that slew Allathan. Chastened by this, his apprentices created the modern orbs. Though not nearly as powerful as the original, there are many, ensuring that they will never be lost in a single disaster. Abilities/Effects: You may use this orb as a spellcasting focus when casting divination spells. The orb also has 3 charges, and regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn. If the last charge is ever used the orb cannot regain charges until left undisturbed in a library or museum for 1 day. While holding the orb, you may use an action and expend 1 or more charges to cast one of the following spells: comprehend languages (1 charge), identify (1 charge), legend lore (2 charges). Orb of Nikenes val\u2019Mehan Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement) Description: This small orb, no larger than a pebble, is made from a tiger\u2019s eye gem. History: In the late ninth century Nurion the Undying briefly reappeared from his wanderings at the Sanctorum of the Arcane in Nishanpur, of all places. He delivered the first known example of the orb, along with detailed notes on its construction. Nurion claimed that he did not invent the orb, but rather he found clues to its creation in the ruins of the tower of Nikenes val\u2019Mehan, a First Imperium mage that, it is said, had dealings with the mysterious being known only as Amanth. Nikenes was constantly trying to push the boundaries of what magic could do, and Nurion suspected that an experiment gone wrong was what ultimately destroyed his tower and killed him. Abilities/Effects: This orb may be used as an arcane focus. When it is held, you have advantage on all Constitution saving throws made to maintain concentration on your spells. As a bonus action while concentrating on a spell, you may suspend your concentration for up to 5 rounds, storing the energy of the spell in the orb. As an action, you may resume concentrating on the original spell as if your concentration had not been broken. You must resume concentrating on the spell after 5 rounds of the spell ends. Once the orb is used in this manner you may not utilize it in this way again until dawn the next day. Orb of Opalescence Wondrous item, legendary (requires attunement) Description: These extremely rare black opals have only been discovered near the Sorcerer Stones in the Hinterlands. History: Who creates these orbs, or why, is not known. What is known is that the Ehtzara and the Cult of the Jackal do not look kindly upon those who remove them from the Sorcerer Stones. They claim ownership of the orbs and are exceedingly jealous of their property. Abilities/Effects: You may use this orb as an arcane focus. The orb also has 3 charges, and regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn. If the last charge is ever used the orb loses all magical properties until 7 days has passed. While holding the orb, you may use an action and expend 1 or more charges to cast one of the following spells: prismatic spray (1 charge, save DC 16), prismatic wall (1 charge, save DC 18). Orb of the Hidden Flame Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement) Description: These orbs appear to be made of russet- colored granite. History: The Order of the Hidden Flame had these items developed so they could track the movements of their\u2003 members. Rumors persist that other factions and secret societies maintain their own versions of these items. The existence of such an item is withheld from the common member and if questioned about such an item, its existence is vehemently denied. Abilities/Effects: Each of these orbs is keyed to a specific group such as a secret society, a military order, a religious faction, or something similar. While holding this orb, you may use an action to cast a modified version of locate creature which only locates members or ex-members of whatever group or secret society orb was created to detect. Additionally, while you are attuned to this orb, you cannot be the target of divination magic used to find your location. Orb of the Seer Wondrous item, uncommon Description: This large crystal orb appears to have been carved with wild, twisted glyphs that glow with their own inner radiance. History: The first orb of the seer was created by Ahrizan, a celestial giant of the Tultipet clan. After crafting this orb, he saw a vision of the future, including the horrible fate of the celestial giants. He begged his clan leader to abandon their tyrannical rule over humans, and for his troubles he was declared a traitor and slain. After the curse was laid upon the dwarves, the Tultipetans remembered Ahrizan, and began to revere him as a prophet and saint. In penance, they crafted many more of the orbs and gave them to the Temple of Larissa, where these orbs are primarily found to this day. Abilities/Effects: You may use this orb as a spellcasting focus while casting any divination spell. While holding this orb, you may spend 1 minute to receive a glimpse into the future. This glimpse comes as a flood of pictures, sounds, and emotions. You may attempt a DC 15 Wisdom (Insight) check to determine the general emotion invoked by the visions, such as fear, disgust, anguish, distrust, or pleasure. Also, at the GM\u2019s discretion, you may perform a DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check to recall specific details of the vision. If you are a val\u2019Sheem, you gain advantage on your Wisdom (Insight) and Intelligence (Investigation) checks when attempting to discern your visions. Orb of Vision Wondrous item, rare or very rare (requires attunement) Description: This small smooth quartz has an impurity in the center that makes it look like an eyeball. History: Jana Gavius, Inquisitor of the Mother Church assigned to Tralia, had settled into her assigned province well, marrying and bearing two children. Then a Cancerese heretic slipped into her village and spread the deadly disease known as infant\u2019s sleep. Jana caught the heretic soon after, but he laughed in her face. His wicked deed was done, and Jana\u2019s children were among the slain. Jana blamed herself for not discovering him sooner and left her husband to fight in the first Heretic War. To ensure she would never again be caught unawares, she plucked out her own eye and crafted the first orb of vision to replace it. It has since become a symbol of the most fanatical of the Church\u2019s inquisitors. Abilities/Effects: You may only utilize an ocular of vision if you have an empty eye socket. Once placed in your vacant eye socket the orb restores your normal vision. Additionally, this eye has 3 charges which may be used for the following abilities. The orb of vision regains ld3 expended charges daily at dawn. If you use the item\u2019s last charge, roll a d20. On a roll of 1 the orb loses all magical properties for 7 days. None Shall Hide from my Vision: As an action you may expend 1 charge to cast see invisibility. The Far Sight: As an action you may expend 1 charge to cast arcane eye. All Seeing (very rare only): As an action you may expend 2 charges to cast true\u2003 Pacorus\u2019 Gauntlet Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement by a spellcaster) Description: This iron gauntlet is fearsome to behold. Its fingertips are sharpened like talons, while the knuckles, reinforced and ridged, have a different gem affixed above each one. The outer portion of the gauntlet is silver plated, with black chainmail lies underneath. History: Pacorus the Terrible was the most notorious of the Priest-Kings of the Auxunite Empire. It is said there was a hunger inside him, a hunger to spread fear among his subjects. At first these dark ambitions were tempered by his fellow priest-kings, but then Pacorus retreated into his lair for a year and a day, forging his gauntlet of power. When he emerged, the bejeweled gauntlet glittering on his right hand, he could no longer be opposed. The priest- kings who sought to stop him found themselves cowering before him, their bodies wracked with disease and mad cackles mixing with sobs in their throats. For ten years Pacorus spread terror and fear throughout the empire, until he was finally felled by an assassin, much to the people\u2019s relief. Abilities/Effect: This gauntlet is a magic weapon makes your unarmed strikes deal magical slashing or bludgeoning damage. The gauntlet possesses 5 charges and regains 1d4+1 expended charges daily at midnight. If you use the final charge roll a d20. On a roll of 1, you suffer 1 level of exhaustion and the gauntlet regains 1 charge as it feeds off your life energy.

Pengik Memory Beads Wondrous item, common Description: This is a collection of marble-sized prayer beads made of semi-precious stones, looped onto a string of animal gut. These beads are worn as either a necklace or as a wristlet. History: The Pengik people place great stock in their oral history, which is maintained and passed on from generation to generation by their tribal shamans. Some shamans are better at recalling information than others, and those who have difficultly are typically presented with these memory beads. Abilities/Effects: Once you have worn these beads openly for 1 day you have advantage on all Intelligence (History) checks and all Intelligence checks to remember things you have seen or heard.\u2003 Phantom Steed Saddle Wondrous item, rare Description: This finely worked riding saddle comes complete with saddlebags and is trimmed with rare ermine furs. History: This saddle is rumored to have been created for a pompous and fastidious Altherian noble who found the smell of horses offensive and the thought of tending to such a beast beneath his station. Abilities/Effects: You can use your action to command this saddle to create a semi-real light riding horse beneath it, exactly as the phantom steed spell. The saddle only functions in this way for 12 hours each day, but that duration can be divided into 1 hour segments. Pin of Illiir\u2019s Radiance Wondrous item, uncommon Description: This pin is crafted in the shape of the sun with beams of light encircling it. History: After the Cult of the Thousand-Eyed Man massacred the populace of the city of Kofan, the fledgling Inquisition realized that it needed new strength. Before the Patriarch went into hiding he charged the priesthoods with developing more powerful magical items. The temple of Illiir answered the call with this pin, which is still prized by inquisitors in the Mother Church and Milandisian Orthodoxy. The one rule laid upon inquisitors is that these pins are only to be worn when heresy is suspected in the field, for under the pin\u2019s power even the smallest of lies told for the sake of social niceties become difficult, and wearing one in a social setting is a serious faux pas. Abilities/Effects: While this pin is worn openly, any creature that attempts to he to you must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed saving throw, that creature must tell you the truth for 1 minute. Upon a successful saving throw they become immune to the pin\u2019s effects until the next dawn. An affected creature is aware of the pin\u2019s effect and can thus avoid answering questions to which it would normally respond with a he. Such a creature can be evasive in its answers as long as it remains within the boundaries of the truth. Pin of Neroth\u2019s Blessing Wondrous item, legendary (requires attunement by a worshiper ofNeroth) Description: This pin, shaped like an ankh, the holy symbol ofNeroth, and grants Neroth\u2019s blessing to the wearer. History: Many of the Nerothian necropolises of southern Canceri have areas warded against all but the undead, making them all but impenetrable fortresses of the val\u2019Mordane family. During the Heretic Wars Radegond Nordohter, a Milandisian, created five of these pins; one for herself and the others for her four companions, whom she led in a daring raid on one of the larger necropolises. She succeeded in her mission of collapsing the necropolis at the cost of her life, foiling a Cancerese push south. Her pin was found by her enemies, and later copies are now primarily found in southern Canceri. Unlike the original, however, these copies crumble to dust after removal. Abilities/Effects: When this pin is worn openly, you are considered to be undead. You gain immunity to poison damage and the poisoned condition, resistance to necrotic damage, and resistance to nonmagical bludgeoning, slashing and piercing damage from weapons that aren\u2019t silvered. You do not need to eat, sleep, or even breathe. Curse: Once attuned to this item you must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw to remove this pin. On a failed saving throw, you suffer 4 levels of exhaustion. On a successful saving throw, you suffer 2 levels of exhaustion. Once removed, the pin crumbles to dust. Pin of Sarish\u2019s Might Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement by a worshiper ofSarish)\u2003 Description: This pin is purple disk with inscribed sigils of Sarish and it protects the wearer from the touch of infernals. History: Legend has it that these pins were created by brave Sarishans who supported the First Emperor\u2019s crusade against the infernal menace. These legends are false. In actuality these pins were created by Khurshid val\u2019Mehan, a still-living traveling merchant, so that she could charge a higher price. Despite her duplicity, the pins still work as advertised and are frequently found among the brave crusaders at the Wall of the Gods, as well as among the Sarishans of the Dark Triumvirate. Abilities/Effects: When openly worn, any infernal that targets you with an attack or harmful spell must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or choose a new target for their attack or spell. An infernal that fails their saving throw is unable to directly harm or touch you for 1 minute. This effect does not protect you from area effects attacks, such as the fireball spell. Pipe of the Underworld Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement) Description: This ivory pipe is capped at either end with grimy bronze fittings. When smoking from this pipe, the grey smoke tendrils form macabre shapes of menacing spirits. History: Even before the Becherek Heresy, the Nerothians of Canceri preferred to work with undead rather than destroy them. Pratibha Lai created the first pipe of the underworld in the seventh century, giving it in secret to the temple of Neroth. With these pipes the temple was able to enchant and sway rogue undead to return to their necropolises, sparing them from destruction by the Mother Church. She was not given the gift of Neroth, though she did live long enough to see Canceri become an independent nation. After the insurrection, the Nerothians removed the veil of secrecy from her creation, and it can now be found throughout southern Canceri, and rarely in other nations. Abilities/Effects: These pipes may be used as an arcane or divine focus if you are a follower of Cadic or Neroth. When you are holding these pipes, any undead you target with enchantment spells suffer disadvantage on their saving throws to resist the effects.

Pipes of the Madcap Minstrel Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement by a spellcaster with proficiency with wind instruments) Description: This pair of silver flutes is inscribed with a peculiar spiral design around their length. These flutes are tuned to different pitches so that they harmonize with each other. History: Bedlas the Twisted, heretical bard of Erhan, created these paired flutes to help rouse the peasantry into open rebellion against the local temple of Illiir. The rebellion died before it could start, primarily because the Inquisition of the Mother Church dispatched the Legio Lex Talionis to capture and execute Bedlas for heresy. Abilities/Effects: These pipes have 10 charges and regain 1d6 + 4 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the pipes\u2019 last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, these pipes lose their magical properties until you cast 10 spell levels worth of enchantment spells into the pipes, at which point the pipes regain 1 charge and continues to regain charges as normal. While holding the pipes, you can use an action and expend 1 or more charges to cast one of the following spells, using your spell save DC: confusion (4 charges), enthrall (2 charges), and mass suggestion (6 charges). Plume of Righteous Victory Wondrous item, very rare Description: This item is a brightly colored plume fashioned from the tail of the rare kuni bird. History: Since the death of Menesis val\u2019Thnsen and the founding of the Free States of Almeric, the Sons of Righteous Fury have dedicated themselves to uniting Almeric, and thus the val\u2019Tensen family. They have not forgotten their goal of seeing a val\u2019Thnsen on the Alabaster Throne, but they recognize the unification of Almeric as a necessary first step. To this end, they have crafted plumes of righteous victory for their allies. The plumes are deliberately crafted in the Ulfilan and Milandisian style, eschewing the typical Coryani crest, as a symbol of the change they seek to bring to Onara. Abilities/Effects: While wearing a helm or hat with this plume attached, as a bonus action you can cast either righteous fury or smite infidel (save DC 13). Once either one of these spells are cast from the plume it may not cast that spell again until the next dawn. See Chapter Nine for righteous fury and smite infidel.

History: The pomander is typically housed inside a gold case sculpted to appear as an apple, orange or pomegranate. Most popular amongst the devotees of Larissa, Goddess of Passion, at least one of these devices can be found amongst the courtiers of the various courts of Onara. Pomanders can also be found scattered about the homes of the affluent, transforming them into a pleasing and relaxing retreat from the squalor and most importantly smell of city life. Abilities/Effects: This pomander can be attuned to any room no larger than 50 square feet. Once attuned, a creature touching the pomander may use an action to grant all creatures within the area resistance against poison damage and advantage on all saving throws to resist disease or the poisoned condition for 1 hour.

Pot of Simmering Wondrous item, uncommon Description: Common among nobility serving their time in the legions, these small cast iron bowls are etched with permanently inscribed runes of fire, and thought not powerful enough to create a campfire these useful bowls can be used to cook food and keep drinks warm on the coldest of nights. Interestingly these bowls have an additional use; they can burn away the poison from tainted food. History: Emperor Quintelus val\u2019Dellenov\u2019s third son Efrem never wanted to be a legionnaire; he wanted to be a scholar and artificer. However, his father was insistent that no son of his would \u201cspend his days locked up in a library like an Altherian\u201d, and forced him into the Legion of the Mighty Oak. Efrem despised the rough life of a legionnaire, and used his skill with artificing to create the pot of simmering so he could at least get a hot meal on cold nights, and ensure the moldy rations did not kill him. Sadly, his magic pot could not stop enemy arrows, but after his death his fellow legionnaires sold his creation at a profit. Pots of simmering are now marketed to noble households throughout Onara. Abilities/Effects: As an action you may put food or drink in this pot and have it heat up as if it were under the effects of a heat metal spell.

Raiment of Illiir Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement) Description: These pure white garments are trimmed with ermine and gold-cloth, with a golden sunburst emblazoned upon the chest. History: Dating from the Imperium, these vestments have always been worn by the high priests of Illiir while enacting their sacred rituals. Most of these ancient vestments have been stolen, lost through the ages, and the priests of Illiir are always seeking their return. Agents of the Silence vie with them on this search, but with the goal of desecrating and destroying these holy apparels.

Additionally, you have advantage on saving throws against spells cast by divine spellcasters who do not worship Illiir. Red Howler Mask Wondrous item, rare Description: This is a large ironwood mask painted blood red and carved in the image of a bestial creature with ivory tusks, distended lupine ears, and a shaggy mane of hair. When this mask is donned, it animates into a snarling visage of horror. History: The first of these items to be studied by humans came to the Free City of Blackwand three years before the outbreak of the Coryani Civil War. Laghyphe of Pajharo, a Kio adventurer, had discovered the item in an abandoned Gar Dolem camp in the wilderness of Uggur. The mask finally laid to rest the long-standing legend that the infamous Red Howler tribe were lycanthropes who could transform themselves into wolves. Now it is believed that their fiercest warriors simply don these masks and take on bestial visages, though that is hardly less terrifying for their opponents. Abilities/Effects: While this mask is worn you possesses darkvision out to a range of 60 feet. If you already have darkvision, your range is increased by 60 feet. In addition, you can bite as an unarmed strike, dealing 1d6 piercing damage. Bestial Howl (Requires Attunement): While wearing this mask, you may howl as action to cast fear (save DC 15). Once you use this ability, you cannot use it again until the next midnight. Robe of Shadowshaping Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement) Description: This thick, black velvet robe cloaks its wearer in darkness. Under bright sunlight, the robe seems to shimmer somewhat and faint magical glyphs can be seen tracing over the surface. The lining of the robe seems to be pure shadow, and is always chilled to the touch. History: It is a sad truth that the infernal taint of the dark-kin often finds expression in acts of evil. For Mendion the Forktongue, a ninth century bard of little renown, this darkness instead found expression in somewhat self-indulgent and depressing poetry, devotion to Cadic, and fascination with the Shadow Realm. Although his tormented verse never became popular, he created the robe of Shadowshaping, which gained great renown among other followers of the Dark God. The Mother Church tried to commission Mendion as a scholar and artificer, but his heart was in his poetry, and he died penniless in Plexus. illumination for 24 continuous hours, after which it regains 1 charge. Shadow\u2019s Embrace: While in complete darkness, you may use a bonus action and expend 1 charge to become one with the shadows, effectively becoming invisible for 1 hour.

Shadow Servants: As an action you may expend 2 charges to summon 2 shadows. These shadows do not have the ability to create new shadows and remain for 1 minute or until they are reduced to 0 hit points.

See Chapter Nine for the new spell, Shadow Step. throw. On a failed saving throw that creature cannot speak a deliberate lie as long as the rope restrains them, Once used to restrain a creature, the rope cannot be used again until dawn. The rope has AC 20 and 20 hit points. It regains 1 hit point every 5 minutes as long as it has at least 1 hit point. If the rope drops to 0 hit points, it is destroyed. Rope of Security Wondrous item, uncommon Description: This item appears to be a length of simple, hemp rope. History: The Hinterlands is far from safe, but there are those who must still make their way across these troubled lands. Kiul, an ascetic, suffered numerous attacks by bandits and vicious beasts as he trekked through this dangerous area. After an attack that left him gravely wounded, he was nursed back to health by a wandering Ehtzara. Taking pity on the traveler, the mystic invoked the blessings of the spirits and enchanted a piece of rope to grant travelers a safe-haven. As word of this device spread throughout the Known Lands, there was a great demand for it and eventually the Ehtzara traded these enchanted ropes to the various Yhing hir tribes, who in turn sold them to others for various favors and boons. Abilities/Effects: This rope is 60 feet long and weighs 5 pounds. If you hold one end of the rope and use an action to speak its command word, the rope surrounds a 20-foot radius area, erecting a ward that protects the area from unwanted intrusion. For the next 8 hours, this ward alerts you whenever a Tiny or larger creature touches or enters the warded area. When you set the rope, you may designate creatures that won\u2019t set off the ward. You also choose whether the ward\u2019s alert is mental or audible. A mental alarm alerts you with a ping in your mind if you are within 1 mile of the warded area. This ping awakens you if you are sleeping. An audible alarm produces the sound of a hand bell for 10 seconds within 60 feet. Once used, the rope cannot be used again until the next dawn. Saddle of Mount Mastery Wondrous item, uncommon Description: This Khur Gi style saddle is plain and functional, designed for form over function by this taciturn people. History: This saddle was first created by a Khur Gi shaman who sought to prove that his power was greater than that of the Ehtzara. To do this, he declared that he would tame a dire bat that had been terrorizing the area for years and that the Ehtzara had been unable to banish. After stalking the beast for weeks, he and a group of warriors were able to capture the creature long enough to place the saddle upon it. Miraculously, the beast became docile enough to be flown back to the heart of the Khur Gi encampment, where the shaman basked in the glory showered upon him by the tribe. Sadly, the shaman was found days later, ripped apart like an overripe fruit. The enchanted saddle that had won him such acclaim had been tossed to one side and the dire bat was gone. Wisely, the Khur Gi chieftain declared that the saddle would be used solely on natural creatures and that creatures within the supernatural realm would be best left to the Ehtzara. Abilities/Effects: This saddle may be worn by any Medium or Large mount. When this saddle is first put on a creature, they must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or become docile and well-behaved. While the mount is docile, its rider gains advantage on any Wisdom (Animal Handling) checks that relate to the mount. Each day at dawn, the mount can make a new saving throw. If the mount succeeds or if the saddle is left off the mount for more than 1 hour, the mount is free of the enchantment until the next dawn. Saddle of Security Wondrous item, very rare Description: This monogrammed saddle appears as a normal, albeit highly-decorated, military saddle. History: Created by the Pearl Maidens to protect members of their monastic order from the many predators that roam the Hinterlands, this item tends to capture more of the two\u00aclegged variety than the four-legged ones. Either way, the vermin are dealt with quickly and without mercy. Abilities/Effects: This saddle can be worn by both Medium and Large sized mounts. It is enchanted with a permanent arcanist\u2019s magic aura spell, giving it a false aura to appear nonmagical. As an action, you can command this saddle to cast the alarm spell that only affects the mount wearing it. If any creature but yourself attempts to ride the mount, the spell alerts you with an audible alarm. In addition, the saddle will cast hold person (DC 12 saving throw, no concentration needed) on whatever creature triggered the alarm. When you activate this effect, you can designate creatures that won\u2019t set off the alarm. Once you use the saddle in this way, you cannot do so again until the next dawn. Saraph\u2019s Spanning Rug Wondrous item, rare Description: This is a 5 ft. by 10 ft. wool carpet with geometrical patterns woven in blue and black upon its surface. History: The ancient Auxunite Empire was an exotic land, filled with wondrous and bizarre magical artifacts. After their expulsion from the area south of the Gods\u2019 Wall, a few of these relics were left behind and are still found by intrepid explorers and treasure hunters. In a cache beneath a dangerously tilted stone tower in the Duchy of Tralia, dozens of wool rugs were discovered, miraculously preserved as if they were weaved just the other day. Abilities/Effects: As an action you may command the rug to grow to four times its original size (20 ft. by 40 ft.) and become rigid. The rug does not attach itself to surfaces but it is strong enough to bridge gaps. While expanded, the rug can support up to 600 lbs., exceeding this maximum causes it to tear and break, dropping everything it was supporting. As an action, you may command the rug to quickly return into its original form, rolling up at your feet. Sarishan Seal Wondrous item, uncommon Description: These large stamps are forged from Sarishan steel and have a long handle. On the underside of the seal is a series of arcane symbols surrounding the holy symbol of Sarish. History: These seals are forged by Sarishan priests to seal contracts between parties, be they merchants, rulers or infernals. All signatories to the contract know that breaking the letter of the agreement carries with it dire consequences, which includes divine retribution. Those who swear by Lord Sarish\u2019s name do not do so lightly. Abilities/Effects: Worshippers of Sarish may use this seal as an arcane focus. If held while casting the Sarishan oath spell, this seal forms a magical connection between itself and the oath. A Sarishan seal be linked to a maximum of 3 independent oaths. When holding the seal, you can mentally review the oaths it is currently linked to and disconnect the seal from any or all of those oaths. If any party breaks one of the oaths a Sarishan seal is linked to, all involved parties are instantly aware of it. Additionally, while holding the seal, those cursed with the Curse of the Oathbreaker suffer disadvantage on all saving throws against any divination spell cast by you. See Chapter Nine for the new spell, Sarishan oath. Sash of Keleos Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement) Description: Four rhinestones are set into red\u00acgold plates that are attached to this sash. The sash itself is made from fiery-red silk threads, interwoven with fine gold strands. History: This item, and others of its kind, is part of a set of ancient eloran artifacts connected to the Elemental Lords. Though Keleos has not answered any prayers directed to him in centuries, items blessed by him, such as this sash, are revered by the elorii as a lasting link to their devoured god. Elorii do not look kindly upon humans wearing these belts, and actively hunt any val believed to be possessing one. Abilities/Effects: While this belt is worn you gain resistance against fire damage. If you already have resistance to fire damage, you have advantage on all saving throws to resist spells or effects that cause fire damage. You also gain the ability to cast produce flame, using Charisma as your spellcasting ability. Scabbard of the Blessed Wondrous item, uncommon Description: This plain scabbard bears the holy symbol of the deity it is dedicated to embossed on its side. History: Divine artificers of the Imperium of Man sought to create ever more opulent items of power. With great pride they would bring their jewel-encrusted, gold-wrought trinkets to the Temple of the Pantheon, more for their own glory than for the glory of the gods. Then one day Akantha val\u2019Inares presented twelve simple scabbards, each unadorned save for an embroidered symbol of one of the gods of the Pantheon of Man. Some reacted with scorn, and others with fury at such a plain offering, but Eunike val\u2019Virdan stepped forward, sheathed her sword within the scabbard of Nier, and drew it forth again. The sword glowed with divine power, and Eunike boldly declared that Akantha had put all the pride of the priests to shame, for with her simple gift she had enhanced the strength of the armies of humanity. Since that time none have tried to embellish these scabbards, for their plainness is a reminder that the gods favor substance over appearance.\u2003 Abilities/Effects: If you are a worshipper of the same god that the scabbard is dedicated to you may use a bonus action to bless your blade as you draw it from the scabbard. A non-magical sword blessed in this way becomes a magic weapon and grants a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls for the next hour. Once used, you cannot use this ability again until the next dawn. Simple Gifts (Requires Attunement): You may only attune to the scabbard if you are a divine spellcaster dedicated to the same god as the scabbard. While wearing the scabbard, you may cast smite heretic, using Wisdom as your spellcasting ability. Once used, you cannot use this ability again until the next dawn. See Chapter Nine for the new spell smite heretic. Scabbard of the Elements Wondrous item, uncommon Description: These finely tooled wood and leather scabbards are always etched with patterns depicting one of the four elements: mountains for earth, rivers for water, flames for fire, and clouds for air. History: Perinia the Berokene, Vatatos the Kelekene, Terethes the Marokene, and Avarea the Osalikene were renowned in Belestor as the finest artisans of their bloodlines. Being friendly rivals, they organized : competition between them to each design a beautiful, yet functional, scabbard. Soon their contest became something else entirely, as the four masters pushed, critiqued, and advised each other to greater heights of skill. Crowds gathered. All sensed that something marvelous was in the making. And then the Elemental Lords, in all their glory, appeared before them. They declared the work a symbol of the strength of the bloodlines when they worked together, and they imbued not only the originals, but all future scabbards made in the same manner with a breath of their power. Even today some few artisans still toil endlessly to recreate the original masterworks. Abilities/Effects: Each of these scabbards is attuned to an element: earth, air, fire, or water. Any time you draw a non-magical blade from one of these scabbards, as a bonus action you may infuse it with elemental power. This makes the sword a magic weapon that grants you a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls and deals an additional 1d4 damage of the appropriate elemental type (acid for earth, cold for water, thunder for air, fire for fire) for the next hour. Once used this ability cannot be used again until the next dawn. Strength of the Bloodlines (Requires Attunement): You can only become attuned to one of these scabbards if you are an elorii whose bloodline matches the element of the scabbard. Any time you draw a non-magical blade from the scabbard, as a bonus action you may infuse it with elemental power. This makes the sword a magic weapon that grants you a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls and deals an additional 1d6 damage of the appropriate elemental type (acid for earth, cold for water, thunder for air, fire for fire) for the next hour. You may use this item a number of times equal to your Blood Rank, regaining all expended uses daily at dawn. Scarab of the Bronze Catacombs Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement) Description: These scarabs appear as small, stylized beetles crafted from bronze and set with small fragments of jet and black opals. History: These insidious scarabs were invented by the twisted mind of one of the ancient Necromancer Lords ofMyrantis, Lord Neferka Siptah. Lord Siptah was an adherent of the god Tzizhet, the Many Limbed, making frequent sacrifices to this abomination. He created these scarabs as a means of sending sacrifices to Tzizhet\u2019s home, a never-ending labyrinth of twisting bronze tunnels, all leading invariably to his deity\u2019s lair. Abilities/Effects: While this scarab is held, as an action you may throw it at creature and cast maze on that target. Once the spell ends, the scarab returns to you and cannot be used again until the next dawn. Sentinel Necklace Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement) Description: This simple choker is made from twisted rose-thorns. The barbs of the thorns stick and jab the wearer\u2019s neck, keeping them awake. The longer you wear this necklace, the more unhinged you become due to lack o| sleep. History: The Temple of Larissa keeps the origin of these necklaces a secret, for they were created by the infamous Iduma val\u2019Sheem, better known for defecting to and later leading the cult of the Lady of Thorns. While these necklaces are simply too useful to many adventurers and to the Coryani legions to declare them heretical, the Larissans fear the backlash should the truth of their creation be known. Meanwhile Iduma made many of these necklaces for the cult after his defection, the cult now uses them as part of their recruitment techniques, driving initiates mad from lack of sleep and then brainwashing them. Abilities/Effects: While worn, you cannot fall asleep under any means and are immune to any effect that would cause you to fall asleep. You do not gain any levels of exhaustion from this lack of sleep. If you wear this necklace for more than 3 days, you have disadvantage on all Intelligence and Wisdom checks. If you wear this necklace for 4 days, you have disadvantage on all Intelligence and Wisdom saving throws. If you wear this necklace for 5 days or more, you suffer from indefinite madness. Serpent Boots Wondrous item, uncommon or rare Description: These knee-boots are made from the hide of a giant constrictor snake and shod at the heel and toe with copper. The toe is ornamented to appear as a viper\u2019s mouth. History: Ownership of these boots is considered a badge of honor for those serving in the Shining Patrol. Seeing a pair on a patrolman means that they engaged and killed a ssanu during their tour of duty. The hide of the ssanu is then taken to an Altherian mage-artificer, who uses it to create a pair of serpent boots. Since the members of the Shining Patrol come from all over the continent, these boots can be found across Onara, usually on the feet of retired members of the Patrol. Abilities/Effects: While worn you may use a bonus action to disguise your tracks as the tracks of a snake for up to 1 hour. This hour does not need to be continuous, and may be deactivated as a bonus action. Once this these boots have been used for an hour, the magic in these boots cease to function until you have completed a long rest. The rare version of these boots also grant advantage on saving throws to resist poison damage or the poisoned condition. Shawl of Starry Witchcraft Wondrous item, uncommon Description: These shawls are made of black wool and sewn with small crystals that glitter and shimmer in the hght. History: The first of these shawls was created in the region that eventually became Salantis, and used fish scales instead of crystals to create the shimmering effects. Egica, the shawl\u2019s creator, led his people in worshiping an unnamed god of sea and stars. For some time, his magical power allowed his people to flourish, but as he grew older his mind sank into madness. Eventually his own people turned on him, slaying him and delivering his shawl to the priests of the gods of the Pantheon of Man. It is rarely used by trained mages, but hedge mages and other isolated spellcasters often favor its power. Abilities/Effects: While wearing this shawl, you can use it as a spellcasting focus which grants you a +1 bonus on spell attack rolls Shroud of the Initiate Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement) Description: This hood, used during certain ceremonies, is made from black cloth that covers the head and face. A fine gold mesh covers the eyes, but still allows one to see clearly. Upon the forehead is a stylized eye embroidered with gold thread. History: This rare item is one of a handful that has some sort of eye motif emblazoned upon it. The eye has nothing to do with the ability of the item, nor is it a crafter\u2019s mark, leading many to be perplexed by its prominent placement. Among val\u2019Abebi scholars, there is a heated debate as to whether an as yet unknown group or organization was, or still is, secretly manipulating the nations and people of the Known Lands. Taken separately, these relics may point to nothing, but other eye symbols found in strange doorways and ancient passages, as well as complete passages excised from tomes with clear precision, cause some to wonder. Abilities/Effects: While worn you cannot be the target of a divination spell or perceived by magical scrying sensors. As an action, you can use the hood to change the color of your skin, hair and clothing, granting you advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made to hide or Charisma (Deception) checks to disguise yourself for up to 1 minute. After using this ability, you cannot use it again until you complete a short rest.\u2003 Skeleton Key Wondrous item, uncommon Description: A Skeleton Key appears to be a sturdy steel key three inches in length. It has many strange and twisted prongs jutting from the shaft at weird angles and the head of the key is carved to look like a grinning human skull. History: Hundreds of these items have been found throughout Onara but they all owe their origin to the devious and crafty mind of Dellius val\u2019Borda. A rogue and a liar, Dellius hailed from the city of Plexus. He plied his trade as a seedy merchant, sailing the waters of the Corvis River looking for salvageable cargo. It is rumored that not all of the ships Dellius and his crew salvaged had sunk before he got there. He had a knack of stumbling across the worst wrecks as there were never any survivors. Dellius had a minor mage as a crewman and it was this unnamed cutthroat who enchanted the first skeleton key.

All legion standards are 10-foot tall poles with a horizontal crossbar where the standard is suspended.

History: Though this banner was once the standard for a Yarricite legion, its names and accomplishments are lost and unrecorded. The standard was washed ashore near the city of Naeraanth after an underwater tremor caused a small tidal wave that flooded the area. It was given to Prince Dolfgar val\u2019Ossan of Naeraanth, founder of the Milandisian League, who believed that no army could be defeated while in possession of the standard. History proved that conceit true, though many doubt that the banner was the reason for his military successes. After the interregnum, the val\u2019Ossan kings of Milandir created an elite force of knights sworn directly to the preservation of val\u2019Ossan line.

The banner itself smolders, smoking slightly. History: From records uncovered by the Followers of the Azure Way, the Legion of the Black Sun was the most feared legion of the Imperium, due perhaps to its taking of the gods Nier and Neroth as its patron deities. Fragments\u2003 of scrolls tell of their heroism during the War of the Three Empires, but beyond that, very little is known of this legion. Millennia later, the Black Sun standard was rediscovered by a former legionnaire, but due to a rebellion led by Nierites, Sarishans and Nerothians, the emperor disbanded the assembled men and burned the hapless discoverer of the standard alive. The two gods were displeased by the disrespect shown by the emperor and raised the moldering corpses of the original legionnaires of the Black Sun. These events so shocked the emperor, that he ordered the standard be locked deep within the vaults beneath the imperial palace.

In the passes leading up to the gates, the valiant legionnaires held against the tides of Khitani invaders. After days of unending battle, General Idan val\u2019Borda, the last commander of the legion, had little hope for reinforcements. He handed the standard to a young herald, and while calling out For Duty and Honor he personally led the charge against the Khitani.

The words Ultioneus Illiir are emblazoned beneath in gold letters, which translates to The Vengeance of Illiir. History: Hailed as one of the more prestigious legions during the age of the Imperium, the Legio Lex Talionis was one of the first dozen legions reconstituted under the First Emperor, just prior to the founding of the Coryani Empire. Always a pious Illiirite legion, in the modern era, it became so orthodox in its interpretation of scripture that it eventually became the military arm of the Inquisition, hunting heretical cults and infernal worshippers. The standard is only brought from its place of honor during times of war and crisis.

Pieces of star iron can be found here in relative abundance, where they are collected by the native tribesmen. With these slivers of star iron, the dwarven craftsmen of Nol Dappa create starfire pendants. Forged in the deepest volcanic fissures beneath the city of Erduk, the pendants absorb the very heat around them. Each pendant is enchanted by a dwarven priest of Nier and provides resistance against heat and fire. The Nol Dappan dwarves are loathe to use such items, as it abates their suffering from the tremendous heat hey live under, but grudgingly use them if they must endure the suicidal levels of heat and flame in the bowels of the volcano they call home.

In a rare show of cooperation, the two societies pooled their resources to tackle the problem.

Hazanko is cursed like all his misbegotten kin, but unlike other gnomes, Hazanko is working on a cure. He fully believes that his condition is temporary and is determined to purge every ounce of dwarven blood from his broken form. Hazanko has delved into dark secrets of biomancy, pouring over voluminous ancient texts, from ancient ssethric scrolls to tomes purportedly stolen from the libraries of Ymandragore.

Titan-Bone Altar Wondrous item, legendary (requires attunement to a location [room]) Description: This large, menacing looking altar is made entirely of bone. History: Far out in the depths of the Hinterlands lies a blasted wasteland known as the Graveyard of the Titans. Here, gigantic bones of long dead creatures rise out of the dried mud and windblown silt, silhouetted against the blaring noonday sun, silent sentinels of a forgotten age. Foul creatures of all types inhabit this region, and only the most heavily armed and well-supplied explorers dare to cross this region. One of the strangest inhabitants of this land is Vehok val\u2019Mordane, otherwise known as the Bone Mage. It is believed that Vehok is a necromancer from Canceri that accompanied an ill-fated expedition to the Ghost Jackal Cairns. The Bone Mage resides inside a tower made from the titanic bones of some ancient behemoth, and uses the native Hua\u2019gi goblins as slaves, or worse. In a small chamber atop his rib-cone tower sits a strange structure representing the pinnacle of the Bone Mage\u2019s power. In the center of the room lies an altar, built from the bones of men and ancient creatures. The claws of some huge behemoth form posts in the corners of the altar to which captives or corpses can be tied spread eagle. Adorned with skulls of hyena men, harpies, and other humanoids, the entire scene proves to be a macabre spectacle. The true terror of this device comes into focus on the dark moonless nights that sometimes settle over the wasteland. On those nights, the Bone Mage lays a fresh corpse upon the altar and performs profane rites. At midnight, the corpse rises, animated in a mockery of life, to serve its new master in death. Abilities/Effects: This altar can be attuned to any room 100 square feet or less. The ritual to attune the altar requires the sacrifice of 4 sentient creatures which become zombies. These zombies remain near the altar at all times and attack anyone who tries to destroy it. Once attuned, placing a freshly deceased creature on the altar during a moonless night causes the corpse to raise as a zombie. Placing a freshly deceased creature upon the altar and burning 200 gp worth of incense causes the corpse to rise as a ghoul. Undead created by the altar cannot be controlled by the process described below. The zombies created when the altar was attuned to its location can never be controlled. Any undead which move farther than 1 mile from the altar are destroyed.\u2003 As an action, a creature can touch the altar and expend a spell slot. Expending a 5 th level spell slot or lower lets the creature assert control over undead created with the altar as if casting animate dead at a spell level equal to the slot level expended. Expending a 9 th level spell slot or lower lets the creature assert control over undead created with the altar as if casting create undead at a spell level equal to the slot level expended. Any undead with a CR 1 or higher that come within 1 mile of the altar must make a DC 18 Charisma saving throw or fall under the control of the altar. Those that make their save constantly feel a \u201cpull\u201d to the altar\u2019s location and may seek it out but are not under its control. The titan-bone altar is 10 feet long by 8 feet wide and 3 feet high, and weighs 900 lbs. It has AC 15 and 100 hit points. If destroyed, all undead created by the altar are released from its control. The altar then reforms 100 days later in a random uninhabited location on the same plane. See Location Attunement Sidebar, pg. 103. Toga of Office Wondrous item, uncommon Description: This pristine white toga has a single deep green bar as trim, denoting its wearer as a member of one of Coryan\u2019s leading families. History: Milo Corvanus was elevated to patrician of the fledgling Coryani Empire by the First Emperor himself before the battle of Hope\u2019s End. His son Linus, was among the first generation born with no knowledge of the Time of Terror. Unlike his father, he rankled at his green-trimmed toga setting him apart from the gold-trimmed togas of the val. To compensate for this, he crafted the first toga of office. While many of the older generation found this a sign of vulgarity and ingratitude, many of his generation, and subsequent generations, had similar togas crafted.

History: Gelvira was one of many Nol Dappan followers of the Sword of the Heavens after his reemergence, but his disappearance in the Blessed Lands left her confused and without a purpose. Partially to follow in his footsteps, and partially to seek the will of Nier, Gelvira took the path of the pilgrim. In the Corlathian Mountains her band of faithful were assaulted by Singarthan trolls, who cornered them within caves. With few tools at her disposal, Gelvira was nonetheless able to create gauntlets enchanted with fire, and held off the trolls until the pilgrims were rescued by the Soldier Saints of Dagha. Feeling the touch of purpose in her defense of others, Gelvira crafted troll\u2019s lament, building on the makeshift gauntlets that had saved her life.

They bear a glamour inside them that makes coins, gems or jewelry placed inside to appear more valuable. History: It is a sad fact that not everyone opposed the Infernals during the Time of Terror. One merchant doing business in the trading hub of the Plexus was swayed by promises of riches into a number of demonic pacts. This urn was the result of one such deal, and made him a very rich man, at least until he was murdered by a customer angered by his no-refund policy. The fact that these items are created even today via infernal pact is not widely known, or else they would be considered heretical, rather than merely illegal. Abilities/Effects: While this urn is held you may use an action to place up to 500 gp worth of jewelry, gems, or coins within it. For 1 hour, all items placed into the urn appear to be more valuable, doubling their worth. If a creature examines an item from the urn and succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence saving throw they can see through the urn\u2019s illusion. All items placed in the urn revert to their normal appearance after 12 hours. Once used, the urn loses its magical properties until 7 days have passed.\u2003 Valor Guards Wondrous item, uncommon Description: Decorated with carved images of holy champions, and other righteous warriors, these bracers bolster their wearer and inspire them to greater acts of bravery and valor. History: Galaros Fen was raised in the elemental traditions of Lhyllifel, and even given an elorii name by his Undir parents. But when beasts attacked his caravan it was not the Elementalists who saved him, but a band of adventuring holy champions of the Mother Church. In them Galaros found a sense of purpose he had lacked. He converted, and in tribute to the brave adventurers who had saved him he made the first valor guards, decorated with their battle against the beasts. Later versions of these items would depict other scenes, but always prominently featuring the holy champions of the Mother Church. Abilities/Effects: While these bracers are worn any time you are targeted by a spell or effect which imposes the frightened condition you may use a reaction to gain advantage on a saving throw against the spell or effect.

History: These vestments were created by Hermine Althaus for the Hurrianites who served Overprince Walport val\u2019Holryn in battle against the infernal horde during the Time of Terror.

History: Life in the gnome slums outside Tir Betoq was hard for Sava. When a wandering priest of Anshar passed through, she begged to accompany him. He agreed, and took her to his small chapel in the Western Lands. Most Ansharans protect the downtrodden, but this priest was corrupt and treated the poor gnome as a slave. With nowhere else to turn, she swore vengeance. Her twisted body made physical revenge unlikely, but her mind was sharp, and she turned it toward magic. She created these boots, knowing they would be stolen by the cruel priest. She began leaving bait outside the chapel, drawing wild beasts. It was only a matter of time before the priest was attacked and sought to use her boots to escape. Then Sava had her revenge. Curse: This item is cursed, a fact that is revealed only when an identify spell is cast on the item or you attune to it. Until they are worn and first used, they will identify as boots of speed.

Boots of the Toad Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement) Description: These boots are usually fashioned from leather and sport a green color with splotches of black-speckled yellow and brown.

History: Liginaosh, a brilliant but spurned gnome, grew tired of being ridiculed and chased out of taverns when he politely asked for food. After a particularly brutal beating at one inn, he invented a device to help him steal the food that he was being denied.

If these boots are removed, the changes to your body are slow to fade, requiring the passage of a month before your skin and voice return to normal. Fangs of the Night Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement) Description: This necklace appears as a mismatched set of teeth on a leather thong. History: The origins of the first of these malicious items is believed to be a strange cult of feral humans living in the wilds of Uggur, a vast and trackless wasteland filled with savages and beasts. The little that is known of their origins, mainly from the carvings upon the fangs, points towards the Seekers of the Waxing Moon, a sect devoted to some dark and hoary god. A number of these items first appeared on a caravan from Llyllifel, traveling throughout the League of Princes. Abilities/Effects: While wearing this necklace you have darkvision out to a range of 60 feet and have advantage on attack rolls, saving throws and checks at night.

You cannot remove the necklace or end your attunement to it unless you are affected by remove curse or dispel evil and good. Locker of the Lost Mariner Wondrous item, legendary (requires attunement to a location [ship]) Description: This large, waterlogged sea chest is bound in tarnished brass and smells of brine and rot. History: When the Yarricite priests of Naeraanth went to the newly conquered province of Salantis to confront the Yarric Heresy they did not do so naively. They brought a newly enchanted Yarricite item, a sea chest that could produce a fog bank. This would disorient any peasant resistance while the inquisitors took whatever steps were necessary. When they were later attacked by abominable forces, they sought to use the chest to escape. They failed. The next morning revealed that whatever forces had attacked them had transfigured the chest into a waterlogged and rotting thing, and to the horror of the returning inquisitors those who had been left dead in its presence rose the next night.

History: The notorious Retsev Rah, of the Harvesters, traveled Onara for many years disguised as a merchant and selling magical items, including circlets said to grant the power of the dreaded Ordainers. These items were linked to Ymandragore, and allowed the Harvesters to compromise many of the Sanctorum of the Arcane and kidnap numerous mages. Once his true identity was known, any remaining circlets were carefully examined, and duplicates without the Ymandragoran link were made by the militant Hawks of the Sanctorum. But Retsev was a cunning artificer and carefully embedded curses within his work, so that those mages that sought to use the circlets against the Ordainers soon found themselves vulnerable to their greatest foes. Abilities/Effects: As long as this circlet is worn, as an action you may cast detect magic. These circlets possess 3 charges which may be expended for the abilities below.

Slave Bracelets of Larissa Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement) Description: Crafted from silver-plated steel cuffs, these bracelets are both decorative and functional. Attached to each bracelet is a single ring, bound to it by steel chains. History: Pomona Fusia was married to a beast of a man, yet for the sake of her family she endured his cruelties for as long as she was able. Finally, she threw herself on the mercy of the Temple of Larissa, who saw her bruises and offered her sanctuary, but she hesitated. Her family was dependent on her husband\u2019s good will for their survival, and she could not leave him. Her husband was a regular visitor to the Larissan brothels, and this granted another opportunity. Rousanak val\u2019Sheem, artificer of the temple, crafted this bracelet, and arranged for the val\u2019Assante\u2019s favorite brothel girl to gift it to him. Soon he found himself unable to resist serving his wife in all things, though Pomona treated him far better than he had treated her.

History: This tabard was commissioned by Duke Baldawin val\u2019Tensen, second Duke of Moratavia, for his Hurrianic troops. The Duke\u2019s artificers lamented that they were unable to weave together the enchantments requested without creating the curse as a side-effect, but the Duke was untroubled, boldly proclaiming that the warriors of Hurrian would never refuse those in need. Soon, however, he realized that in battle one had to make difficult choices, sacrificing a few to save many more, and that these strategies weakened those men gifted with the tabard, including the Duke himself. Since that time the tabard has been retired from regular service, and now they are only worn by the most devout Hurrianites.

RODS Archaeologists Rod Rod, very rare (optional attunement) Description: This silvery, foot long rod is unadorned but for series of runes etched in a spiral pattern down its length. It is topped by a triangular head, leading some to believe it was created by Sarishans. History: This rod was created by an Altherian secret society, the Seekers of Forbidden Lore, to expedite their exploration of the ancient, forbidden ruins of the Tenecian civilization. The Council of Wisdom, which governs the Republic of Altheria, has declared exploration of that ruined capital city prohibited unless sanctioned and accompanied by an authorized scholar. This led to a scarcity of historians with knowledge of that era. Though never proven, many attribute the disappearance of historians and other scholars throughout the Known Lands to the Seekers of Forbidden Lore, who somehow drained their accumulated knowledge and placed it into these rods. Abilities/Effects: This rod may be used either attuned or unattuned.

History: It is perhaps not surprising that this rod was created in Ventaka, but despite what many might think it was not designed to be a necrotic weapon. Bala val\u2019Mordane intended to enchant the mummified hand with the ability to make another invisible. Bala, however, was cruel to her apprentice Chetana, and in retaliation the apprentice sabotaged the master\u2019s artifact. To Bala\u2019s horror, the demonstration of the rod slew the val\u2019Mordane noble she had intended to vanish. Fler neck was saved, however, when the noble arose as a zombie. The undead patriarchs of the val\u2019Mordane family were intrigued by the possibilities of such a weapon, and gave Bala high honor and an order for a dozen more. Abilities/Effects: You may wield this rod as a magic mace which deals 2d8 necrotic damage upon a successful hit against a living creature, in addition to its normal damage. Additionally, upon a successful hit you may use a reaction to send a surge of necrotic energy though the target\u2019s body, forcing them to make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or suffer an additional 7d8+30 points of necrotic damage, or half as much on a successful saving throw.

History: On the cliffs of Ulfila there dwells a sect of Saluwean druids. Little greenery grows among the rocks, but these men honor and emulate the fauna of the cliffs, particularly the great birds. Tomas Ramunas, archdruid of the sect in the eighth century, lived without food or water for three days on the rock face of the largest cliff, exposed to the elements, seeking guidance from Saluwe. After he had recovered, he threw himself into the creation of this rod. It has been handed down by the druids ever since, and is used to initiate new members by having them live among the birds for three days, in honor of Tomas.

History: Crafted by the wandering Ansharan mystic, Tholosus val\u2019Inares, as he searched for the fabled Vault of Stars. Since Ansharan Gates must be travelled through once so that it may be accessed again, the Ansharans methodically search the continent for lost Portals. Tholosus believed that the Vault of Stars not only contained a map of every active Ansharan Gate, but could be used to travel to anyone of them at will, without previously attuning oneself to them. Sadly, though he discovered over a dozen of previously unknown Portals, Tholosus died before completing his self-appointed quest. As his health was failing, he instructed his small cadre of ascetic priests to craft staves like his, so that they might complete his quest. To date, the existence and location of the Vault of Stars remains a mystery. Abilities/Effects: This staff can be wielded as a magic quarterstaff that grants a +1 bonus to both attack and damage rolls.

History: Among the elorii there are none so attuned to water as the Berokene, and among the Berokene there are no mariners so skilled as the Berotar of Entaris. It was soon after the founding of this order that the Berotar were sorely tested, by the sahuagin and their Ssethregoran allies. Despite their skill, the Berotar suffered greatly in the first assault. Then Issalas, captain of the Lanthras, took the wreckage of her once mighty vessel and crafted the first staff of the deep. Raising it aloft and summoning water elementals to her side, Issalas led a renewed attack against the vile creatures.

History: None now speak of Priska the Shadowed, Twilight Warrior of the Imperium. Her name has been struck from the ranks of that order, and her theories on the Realm of Shadow are reviled as heresy. Yet her experiments produced results, including these staves, her greatest creation. It is said that in the end all color had drained from Priska. She was slain by her fellow Twilight Warriors after she joined with the creatures of shadow, and sought to lead them in vengeance against her brethren. The staves were locked up, part of her forbidden research, until the fall of the Imperium. Then they were lost, only to be rediscovered in the third century.

To their leader, the Ujch\u2019ki, the sentinel staff was given. Over the years the worship of Saluw\u00e9 has diminished, as the Shadow Towns have been swayed by the elemental worship of nearby Entaris.

Staff of Cats Staff, very rare (requires attunement by a worshipper ofSarish) Description: The staff of cats is a quarterstaff made of wood with subtle carvings depicting felines in various poses. The staff has at the base, five small spikes embedded into the wood which is carved to resemble cat claws. The two handgrips, positioned as for a quarterstaff, are silver. History: It is said that the first staff of cats was created by Sherfiruz Mizra, a Cancerese sorcerer-priest, who led a small group living in the woods north of Nishanpur during the Shadowed Age. Rumors told by woodsmen and rangers told of the group summoning and cavorting with Infernals. Priests of Sarish led an \u201cinvestigation\u201d that assaulted and demolished the village. Mizra was captured and the other members were made to denounce her before being executed. The priests confiscated all their records to prevent the resurrection of the cult. To this day, contradictory rumors say that Mizra and his followers were either worshipping a fallen Valinor or paying legitimate respect to Sarish with an emphasis upon His feline followers. The only surviving notes from Mizra\u2019s studies are the instructions for creating the staff of cats, which can still be found in the records of the Temple of Sarish in Nishanpur.

History: When Altheria briefly became a protectorate of Entaris, the Osalikene mage Parias was overjoyed. A firm believer in the prophecy of Ardelia, and a proponent of alliance with human nations for hundreds of years, she crafted this staff to commemorate the occasion. The Altherians promised her gift would see good use in the Shining Patrol. When Altheria broke from Entaris, Parias took it as a personal affront and demanded the return of her gift. Before it could be returned, however, the warrior who held it was ambushed by Ssethregorans, and the staff was lost. In a rage Parias abandoned devotion to Ardelia, and swore to oppose humanity always, distributing the additional staves she had created among the elorii.

Staff of Deadly Wards Staff very rare (requires attunement by a spellcaster) Description: Crafted from bamboo imported from the distant Khitani Empire, this staff appears segmented, with sigils carved into the space between the natural ridges of the wood. History: Li Meirong of the Khitani Empire began her pilgrimage to the Blessed Lands some years after the second Coryani-Khitani war. A sorceress of no small skill, when the Soldier Saints of Dagha offered her protection she scoffed at them, for they had no Khitani in their company. She showed them this staff, which she had crafted herself in her homeland, and declared that this alone would be sufficient to protect her. It is true that the staff helped her escape many deadly predicaments, but the dangers of the Blessed Lands eventually led to her end. The Soldier Saints recovered the staff and gifted it to the Khitani of the First City, and since that time they have ensured their ranks include Khitani as well as Coryani peoples.

Staff of Dreams Staff very rare (requires attunement by a primal spellcaster) Description: The Staff of Dreams is made of several segments of horn connected by bands of gleaming white ivory. There are no engravings in the ivory, but anyone staring into the gleaming ivory will see movement of tiny figures just beneath the surface. History: These staves befuddle scholars with contradictions. They were certainly the work of Horatiu Dragosi, who crafted the first such staff in the tenth century. However, they are mentioned in tremendous detail in the play \u201cDreams of Kla Myrtha,\u201d which was written two hundred years prior for the Theater of the Umbral Mask in Censure. These staves travel freely into Dreamtime, yet shamans who have studied them conclude that they have no connection with that realm. Those who stare at the staff see figures beneath the surface, yet it is clearly solid horn and ivory. House Dragosi not only refuses to divulge the secrets of the staves, but refuses to acknowledge there are secrets, insisting that those who point out the contradictions are merely suffering from a lack of sleep. Abilities/Effects: This staff can be wielded as a magic quarterstaff that ignores the resistances of ethereal creatures. Also, as long as this staff is on your person, you gain advantage on saving throws against the dream spell and if you ever enter Dreamtime, also known as the Spirit Realm, the staff manifests with you.

Staff of the Oceanwalker Staff (unique), legendary (requires attunement) Description: This staff appears a hue of shimmering blue, a side effect of the enchantment upon the driftwood used to create this magical item. History: In the Pirate Isles, there is an old myth of a man from the sea. He was given the nickname Oceanwalker by a fishing captain who was lost at sea during a particularly violent storm and claimed to have seen a shimmering light through nearly impenetrable downpour. As the ship was pummeled by the waves, he slowly steered his ship closer to the strange light. Wiping the water from his eyes, he rushed to the rail and doubted his rheumy eyes \u2014 there, barely twenty yards from his ship, walked a man carrying the light that had drawn the old sea captain; a light that slowly resolved itself into a shimmering blue staff. The man, not twenty yards away, walked calmly on the water like the storm wasn\u2019t even there!\u2003 Fearing that they had been lured to the deaths by some sort of vengeful water spirit, the captain was about to steer his ship away when the man with the staff stopped, looked back over his shoulder and pointed in the opposite direction. He then proceeded to continue walking and disappeared into the storm. Though the ship almost floundered numerous times through the night, the ship weathered the storm and reached port, having headed the direction given to them by man with the staff. Now and again some old sea dog will wander into a tavern telling of a man who walked on the water. Some say he swims like a fish, or rode upon an elemental manifestation of the sea itself, but all the stories agree on one detail, he is always carrying a shimmering blue staff, the Staff of the Oceanwalker. Abilities/Effects: This staff can be wielded as a magic quarterstaff that grants a +2 bonus to both attack and damage rolls.

Staff of Wizardry Staff legendary (requires attunement by an arcane caster) Description: These staffs are all crafted from twisted, knotted darkwood, polished to a smooth finish. The top of the staff is capped with a precious gemstone. History: All the great practitioners of the arcane throughout all the civilizations that have flourished and fallen throughout the Known Lands, have crafted their own Staff of Wizardry as a symbol of their mastery. From the great magi of ages past like the ssanu sorcerer Ss\u2019koreth, the elorii Grand Elementalist Rasmirinas, the Arch Magi of the Imperium of Man, Orris val\u2019Mordane to the modern age arcane master, Nurion val\u2019Assante, all wielded Staffs of Wizardry, albeit differing in appearance. Though it requires one supremely skilled to craft these staffs, they are quite durable, allowing those not as gifted to find ancient copies in the many crypts and ruins that dot Arcanis. Recently, an excavation in the Undercity below the First City uncovered a large, moldering crate containing six of these staffs. Some believe that the area must have acted as underground storage for some sort of academy of sorcery, whose existence was lost to the ages.

Spells: This staff possesses 50 charges for the following properties: Saving Throws: When attuned to this staff and wielding it, you gain advantage on all saving throws.

If your Ability Score is already equal to or greater than the score granted by the staff, this ability has no effect on you. Spell Levels: When casting a spell, the wielder of this staff may, as a reaction, expend any number of charges to empower that spell, casting it as a higher spell slot than it normally would be. For example, if the caster casts cure wounds as a 1 st level spell, they may expend eight charges of this staff to cast this spell as if it were cast as a 9 th level spell. Spell Absorption: As a reaction, when targeted by a hostile spell you may absorb that spell into the staff of wizardry. The absorbed spell\u2019s effect is cancelled and the spell\u2019s energy\u2014though not the spell itself\u2014is stored within the staff. The staff gains a number of charges equal to the level of the absorbed spell. Should the staff absorb more than the maximum 50 charges through this method, the staff discharges all its energy into the wielder, dealing hit point damage equal to the total number of charges in the staff, including those over and above the maximum 50 charges. This staff regains 6d6+6 expended charges daily at dawn. Stormhorn Staff very rare (requires attunement) Description: A Stormhorn is a magical staff crafted from the twisted tapering horns of a behir. A single light blue horn is affixed to a handle carved from the heartwood of an oak tree struck by lightning, and enchanted during a lightning storm.\u2003 History: Along the edge of the Amaryllis River, and along the coastline of Bhiharn, lies a dense tangle of mangrove swamps and murky salt marshes known as the Sword Fens. This fetid Swampland is home to the Undir, and serves mainly as a refuge for highwaymen and pirates. This region is best known for the horrid monsters that lurk in its mosquito-infested depths; trolls, hags and worse can be found within its lush green canopy. It is here that the Kio travel to gather the components necessary for Stormhorns. Though it is rumored that these fell beasts still roam the primeval swamps of the Kraldjur Morass, it is only in the Sword Fens that they can be encountered with any regularity. Finding and killing one of these huge beasts is no easy task, but once accomplished, the Kio collect their prize: a pair of long tapering horns that jut from the behir\u2019s head.

Sylab\u2019s Staff Stajf, legendary (requires attunement by an arcane spell caster) Description: The staff has numerous functions, all of which are triggered by changing the settings of the small gears set into the staff\u2019s metal shaft. The staff itself is just about a man\u2019s height and made from a dull grey steel. Set into its base is a scratched and pitted metal sphere, and capped with the carved head of a nightfox. History: Sylab was not always Arena Master of Sicaris. Fie once was a lowly gladiator, skilled in battle, but condemned by his lack of showmanship. That changed when he caught the eye of Gioia vaFFiaupt, who was seeking a gladiator to invest in. She saw that Sylab not only fought with unparalleled skill, but he understood the business of the arena. As for his showmanship, that was easily supplemented. If he lacked personality, he would simply need a gimmick. Thus, she crafted this staff. With it, Sylab quickly became famous, dazzling audiences who breathlessly waited to see how he would configure his staff for the killing blow. His winnings made Gioia very rich, and earned Sylab the respect he needed to become Arena Master. Abilities/Effects: This staff can be wielded as a magic quarterstaff that grants a +1 bonus to both attack and damage rolls. By adjusting the clockwork mechanisms in the staff, the wielder may launch the carved head of the nightfox forth as a grappling hook connected to the staff by a 50-foot steel chain.

See Chapter Nine for the rules and properties of a mancatcher and spiked chain. Tzizhet\u2019s Gibbering Staff Stajf, legendary (requires attunement by an arcane caster worshipper of Tzizhet or divine caster of Tzizhet) Description: This is a gnarled staff made of worm-eaten pale wood with many sickly discolored knots and small protrusions. When any of the powers are activated, the staff becomes fleshy and pulsates like a living thing, with the knots on the wand opening, revealing multicolored eyes and gnashing teeth.\u2003 History: Merishayeet sought one thing and one thing only, and that was to drive the Coryani from Abessios. In the fourth century, he received a vision, dark and blasphemous, which led him deep into the wilderness, and to the ruins of sunken Myrantis itself. He entered the ruins sane, if obsessed. After two weeks, he left it raving mad, missing an arm and an eye, and wielding the staff that he had carved and enchanted using secrets whispered to him within the ruins. Merishayeet sowed chaos among the Coryani before he was slain, but the staff was never recovered. Throughout the ages the staff has reappeared, always in the hands of a mad Myrantian prophet and rebel. Always it has been lost again upon the madman\u2019s death. Abilities/Effects: This staff can be wielded as a magic quarterstaff that grants a +1 bonus to both attack and damage rolls. This staff possesses 20 charges for the following properties: Confusing Smite: Any time you successfully strike someone in melee with this staff you may expend 1 charge as a bonus action to deal an additional 1d6 psychic damage as well as forcing the target to make a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or suffer the effects of the confusion spell until the end of their next turn. Transmogrification of Madness: While holding this staff, you may, as an action, expend 10 charges to transform your staff into a gibbering mouther. It appears adjacent to you, is friendly to you and your companions, and acts on its own initiative. You possess a mental link with the creature through which you may issue commands (no action required by you). If you don\u2019t issue any commands to the gibbering mouther, it simply attacks the nearest creature. The gibbering mouther remains for 1 hour unless destroyed or dismissed by you as an action. Once dismissed or destroyed, the gibbering mouther disappears with a foul\u00acsmelling mist equal to a stinking cloud (Save DC 14) as and the staff reappears in your hand as long both you and the gibbering mouther were on the same plane of existence.

WfinDS Wand of Anshar\u2019s Blessing Wand, very rare (requires attunement by a worshipper of Anshar) Description: This wand resembles a warped piece of wood with sharp red thorns. History: Most worshippers of the goddess Anshar pray to Her as the patron of travelers and guardian of outcasts, but Her domains encompass pain and suffering, as well. A heretical cult worshipping Her aspect as the Agonized Martyr crafted this wand to share Her blessings with the world. They believe that only through extreme pain can one find enlightenment. They sought to share the gift of agony with others, and quickly ran afoul of the Coryani Inquisition. Though most cells were quickly expunged, a few escaped, still spreading their heretical teachings, gifting their wands to both the depraved and the unsuspecting. Abilities/Effects: This wand has 7 charges. While holding this wand, as an action you can point it at a creature you can see within 60 feet and expend 1 charge to make barbed vines erupt from the creature\u2019s arms, legs and torso, anchoring it to the ground. The creature takes 3d6 magical piercing damage, and unless it succeeds on a DC 16 Constitution save it is paralyzed for 1 minute. As an action on the creature\u2019s turn, it can make another saving throw to free itself and end the effect early. The wand regains 1d6 +1 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a roll of 1, you gain 1 level of exhaustion as the wand wraps a vine around you, draining some of your life force to regain 1 charge. Wand of Dancing Spirits Wand, uncommon (requires attunement by a primal spellcaster) Description: This wand is silver plated, runes stamped laterally from handle to tip. History: During the reign of Osric II the first serious effort was made to explore and catalogue the Faerdwalden. During these efforts Senta val\u2019Abebi, one of the chief researchers, had a strange encounter in the woods that convinced her a species dwelled within who could turn themselves invisible at will. The explorations were abandoned long before completion due to the costs of King Osric\u2019s wars, but Senta\u2019s obsession with these creatures only grew. She created the wand of dancing spirits to help her craft illusions as bait for these creatures, and illuminate their invisible forms in faerie fire. She never produced\u2003 results, and when the explorations were abandoned she stubbornly entered the Faerdwalden, vowing not to return until she had proof. She was never seen again. Abilities/Effects: This wand has 7 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend one charge to cast faerie fire (save DC 14) from it. In addition, while holding this wand the range at which you can cast minor illusion is doubled. The wand regains 1d6+1 expended charges daily at dawn.

Wand of Distraction Wand, uncommon (requires attunement by a primal spellcaster) Description: This wand is slim and metallic in its construction. A poorly etched rune of lightning is inscribed upon it. History: Darius val\u2019Holryn was jealous of his cousin, Leticia, whose bloodline ability mimicked the val\u2019Tensen. This allowed her to call down lightning from the sky, while he benefited from the val\u2019Abebi bloodline powers, which gave him a superb memory and a penchant for knowledge. As they grew older, Darius would fume as Leticia would strike down the enemies of the family with coruscating bolts of energy, while he was told that he would serve best from a desk and surrounded by musty books. After reading treatise written by the Archmagi Nurion, it occurred to him that he could immediate and perhaps exceed his cousin\u2019s powers by fashioning a wand of lightning. Working with the family artificer, he quickly inscribed the lightning rune and joined his family in a quick sojourn to Ashvan, near the border with Canceri. On the road, they were attacked and Darius arrogantly stepped in front of his father, a warrior of renown, and fired his wand. To his utter humiliation, a shower of sparks and swirling fireworks, distracting the attacker long enough for his father to dispatch him. Abilities/Effects: This wand has 7 charges. While holding it, you can use your reaction and expend one charge to cause a creature within 30 feet to make a Dexterity saving throw, DC 16.

If you expend the wand\u2019s last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the wand will no longer function and becomes non-magical. Wand of Grasping Earth Wand, uncommon (requires attunement by a spellcaster) Description: This wand is grey ash in color, with a tip that corkscrews slightly. History: Despite the power they wield, the greatest threat to mages are the superstitious and fearful country folk. Many mages, usually ones that have recently discovered their gift, have fallen victim to angry mobs and beaten or killed. The masters of the Sanctorum of the Arcane understand that these attacks are fueled by ignorance rather than malicious intent and created a wand that deals with these mobs in a non-lethal manner. The wand of grasping earth is given to members that search for untrained mages, taking them where they can safely train. The wand causes the very ground to reach up, tripping and entangling foes, giving them time to escape without causing permanent harm to their pursuers. Abilities/Effects: This wand has 7 charges. While holding this wand, as an action you can expend 1 charge to cast entangle (save DC 15). The wand regains ld6 +1 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20.

Wand of Ice Wand, uncommon (requires attunement by a spellcaster) Description: This wand appears as a branched icicle and very cold to the touch. History: Strange as it may seem, the first wand of ice was created in the deserts of the Coryani province of Toranesta, in what is now the Abessian Dominion. Tatiana Gracci, a distant scion of the Coryani Gracci family, despised the heat of the desert. Although a legionnaire with little magical talent, she was determined to develop a way to keep herself cool. After spending all her spare time in experimentation, she ultimately failed. But in her failure, she created something far more useful, which served her legion well on the battlefield. Abilities/Effects: This wand has 7 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend one charge to cast black ice (save DC 14) from it. When you use the wand this way, the spell creates a patch of black ice instead of an oil slick.

Additionally, it gains one charge whenever an attack made with it deals more than 20 damage in a single blow. It can hold up to 3 charges, but all unused charges disappear when you take a long rest.

As an action, you can expend any number of charges to restore hit points to a creature you can touch with the sword\u2019s blade. Expending 1 charge restores 10 hit points, expending 2 charges restores 20 hit points, and expending 3 charges restores 40 hit point Armor of St . Gaed the Confessor This set of magic plate mail covered in silver filigree grants +1 Armor Class to the wearer.

The spirits of the Blue Dragonflight will fight your enmies, but if ordered to do anything other than fight in a battle against an enemy army, they stand around looking confused, wondering what\u2019s happened to their bodies and the world they once knew. s.

To learn a spell from a knowledge scroll, the spell must be of a level that you have spell slots. The spell must also be one that could normally be on your spell list. For example, you cannot learn an arcane spell from the Elder Tradition if you are a human cleric, nor can you learn a val\u2019Borda secret spell if you are a val\u2019Inares. After 1 hour spent studying the scroll, make an ability check. The ability you use depends on the Arcanum of the spell. If the spell is divine, you must make a Intelligence (Religion) skill check; if it is an arcane spell you must make an Intelligence (Arcana) skill check. In either case, the DC is equal to 15 + the spell\u2019s level. If you succeed, the spell is added to your spell list. If you prepare spells, you can now select the spell you learned as one of your prepared spells. If you have a separate list of spells known, you can choose one of the spells you know and replace it with the spell you learned. You can also replace one of the spells you know with the spell you just learned when you gain a level in your spellcasting class, like normal. If you fail, you do not learn the spell.

Casting the spell by reading the scroll requires the spell\u2019s normal casting time. Once the spell is cast, the scroll crumbles to dust. If the casting is interrupted, the scroll is not lost. If your proficiency bonus does not equal or exceed the minimum proficiency bonus show in the Spell Scroll table, you must succeed on an ability check to determine whether you can successfully channel the magic of the scroll. If the spell is divine, you must make an Intelligence (Religion) ability check. If it is an arcane spell you must make an Intelligence (Arcana) ability check. In either case, the DC is equal to 10 + the spell\u2019s level. If you succeed, you successfully cast the spell. If you fail, you speak meaningless words of power and nothing happens. Regardless of whether the check succeeds or fails, the scroll is destroyed in the process. The level of the spell on the scroll determines the spell\u2019s saving throw DC and attack bonus as well as the spell\u2019s rarity, as shown in the Spell Scroll table.

Trained sorcerers and priests scoff at such items as foolish superstition or the work of charlatans, but those that believe know better and pay trusted shamans, witchdoctors and undir dacoi for these gifts. For additional fetishes see Forged in Magic: Reforged. Animal Fetishes The most common fetish created by shamans across Arcanis, animal fetishes are made by infusing the power of primal animal spirits into an item. These fetishes must be worn openly on your person, not concealed in a pouch or pocket, in order to gain their benefits. Boar Fetish Wondrous item (fetish), common Description: This fetish is made from a pair of boar tusks held together by rawhide straps and decorated with fur strands holding colored beads. Abilities/Effects: Wearing this fetish grants you advantage on death saving throws. If you ever roll a 1 on a death saving throw, you can call on the power of this fetish to succeed on that saving throw. The fetish then crumbles into dust. Dolphin Fetish Wondrous item (fetish), uncommon Description: This colorful bracelet consists of shells and beads, tethered to a strap of rawhide stained with the dried blood of a dolphin. Regardless of its age or conditions, the bracelet always smells of brine. Abilities/Effects: Wearing this fetish grants you a +2 bonus on Strength (Athletics) checks to swim. You can call on the power of this fetish to cast water breathing once, without expending a spell slot or requiring components. The fetish then crumbles into dust. Serpent Fetish Wondrous item (fetish), rare Description: This fetish consists of thin strips of snake skin wrapped around the crowns of snake fangs, binding them to a strip of rawhide. It is commonly made in the form of a bracelet, anklet, or necklace. Abilities/Effects: Wearing this fetish grants you advantage on all saves to resist the poisoned condition. When you take poison damage or gain the poisoned condition you may, as a reaction, call on the power of this fetish to end the condition and gain resistance to poison damage for 1 hour. The fetish then crumbles to dust. Monster Fetishes These fetishes are rarer than animal fetishes as the talisman requires some portion of the creature to draws forth it\u2019s power. These fetishes must be worn openly on your person, not concealed in a pouch or pocket, to gain their benefits. You must wear a monster fetish for a full day before you receive its benefit. Ssanu Fetish Wondrous item (fetish), very rare Description: This headdress consists of the upper half of an adult ssanu skull, bleached white and inscribed with runes. Due to the components required, these fetishes are incredibly rare. Abilities/Effects: Wearing this fetish grants you the ability to cast detect magic as a ritual. You can also cast arcane sight* (DC 15) once, without expending a spell slot or providing components. Once you do so, you cannot use the fetish in this way until you complete a long rest. Additionally, while wearing this fetish you can speak the Ssethric and Ss\u2019ressen languages as if you were a ssethric creature. Bloodbeak Hummingbird Fetish Wondrous item (fetish), uncommon Description: This fetish consists of several bloodbeak hummingbird feathers set into a bone clasp. It is commonly worn as a hair clasp. Abilities/Effects: If you fall while wearing this fetish, you may, as a reaction, call upon the power of this fetish to slow your descent. Your rate of descent slows to 60 feet per round. When you land, you take no damage from falling and you land on your feet. The fetish then crumbles into dust. WHY RUNES? With so many magical items, why runes? Runes grant both players and game masters a way to customize items within a structured rules format. Beyond that, they help alleviate one of the oldest issues in most roleplaying games: discarding one magical item for a better one, regardless of the weapon\u2019s history or significance. When characters find \u201cbetter\u201d items, they are suddenly seeking a buyer for their less potent items By adding a rune to a non-magical suit of armor or weapon of personal or historical significance, a character can create a useful magical item without sacrificing a roleplaying hook. Picking up your father\u2019s blade to hunt down his assassins is more appealing, when the blade has a rune or two to make it a magical sword, rather than just a sharp hunk of metal. No one is certain who developed the techniques for inscribing runes, but evidence shows that they were used by the Eladru cyclops as well as the ssethrics of Yahssremore. Scholars debate how humanity learned this craft. The dominant theory is that they were taught by the elorii before the Great Betrayal, or perhaps gifted humans learned to duplicate the power of eloran enchantments through sheer determination. Dwarven runesmiths all agree that their ancestors, the celestial giants, had mastered the craft, though there is no consensus as to when they appeared upon Arcanis. Runic magic is a complex merging of magical ritual and exacting craftsmanship in order to produce magical reservoirs that capture and direct energy into desired patterns. Few have the patience and devotion required to become a runesmith as mastering these techniques is a long, difficult, and sometimes deadly process. Each rune is an individual work of art, a pattern carefully inscribed into an item and then imbued with magical energy. Runes are visually distinct by type and craftsman, and individual runesmiths can be easily identified by their designs. Runes GFFeCtS & uses Runes are inscribed on non-magical items to grant them magical properties. Each rune\u2019s effect depends upon the type of item the rune is inscribed upon. A fire rune on a weapon allows you to envelop the weapon in flames, while that same rune placed upon on a suit of armor grants you a measure of protection against fire damage. With few exceptions, runes may only be inscribed upon mundane items such as spellcasting foci, weapons, shields, or suits of armor. While there are other enchanted items which may take advantage of runes or have space for additional runes, these are exceedingly rare. Rune Quality and Slots Runes come in a variety of rarities, from uncommon all the way to legendary. Very rare and legendary runes require the wielder to be attuned to the item bearing the rune in order to gain their full potential. If the wielder is not attuned to the item, it is treated as having the effects of an uncommon rune of that type (if one exists). Magic is the power of creation, and just as the strain of its use takes its toll upon a spellcaster, it also takes its toll upon the various inanimate materials it infuses. Since magical energy is not woven into the item during its creation but instead added later, inscribing a rune creates a great deal of tension within the item. Any one mundane item has 3 rune slots, each of which can hold a single uncommon rune. Inscribing a rune onto an item fills one these slots. Runes at higher rarity take up more slots since they must have larger and more intricate patterns in order to hold more magical energy. Runesmiths have rituals and techniques they can use to remove runes from an item, emptying a rune slot and preparing the item to receive another rune. Once an item\u2019s rune slots are full, any attempt to inscribe another rune on the item without first clearing one of its slots will cause the item to tear itself apart. Inscribing Runes Inscribing a rune is time-consuming, expensive and dangerous. Such a task requires the specialized training and experience of a runesmith who spend decades learning and perfecting their craft. Due to the challenging nature of their studies, runesmiths often demand rare materials, help with a difficult task or promises of future favors, in addition to the materials costs of the rune. In order to inscribe a rune, a runesmith must be of an appropriate character level and spend an amount of money and time as indicated on the chart below. If you are inscribing a blessed rune, you must dedicate the rune to a deity that you worship. Runes Effects & Uses Runes are inscribed on non-magical items to grant them magical properties.

The technique required to inscribe an amalgamated rune are known only by a select few, making the cost of such an inscription quite costly. Abilities/Effects: An amalgamated rune entwines two runes into one, allowing you to switch to either rune\u2019s properties as a bonus action. Thus, you may have an amalgamated fire/air rune and switch between one benefit or the other. The runes that form the amalgamated rune must be of the same quality and each may only be of uncommon or rare quality. An item may only hold one amalgamated rune. You must attune to an item bearing an amalgamated rune in order to use the rune\u2019s properties.","title":"Amalgamated Runes"},{"location":"homerules/homerules/magic-items/#blessed-runes","text":"As runes (attunement required) Description: These runes are frequently used by religious institutions for use by their priests and holy champions.Accessing the powers of a blessed runes is as much a test of faith as of skill and power. Abilities/Effects: Blessed runes work in all ways like standard runes except that they are dedicated to a particular deity. Regardless of rarity, you must attune to an item bearing a blessed rune and in order to attune to the item you must worship the same deity the rune is dedicated to. If multiple blessed runes are inscribed on the same item, they must all be dedicated to the same deity.","title":"Blessed Runes"},{"location":"homerules/homerules/magic-items/#entwined-runes","text":"Description: Dariac, a young apprentice of Elebac of Solanos Mor, accidentally rediscovered the techniques required to access a rune\u2019s full range of abilities. Abilities/Effects: These specialized runes allow a wielder to access two of the rune\u2019s effects, switching between them as a bonus action. For example, if you wield a sword with an entwined fire rune you are able to access both the rune\u2019s weapon and spellcasting focus abilities, while that same rune upon armor also grants access to the rune\u2019s weapon ability, allowing you to empower your unarmed strikes. An item can only have one entwined rune inscribed on it. You must attune to an item bearing an entwined rune in order to use the rune\u2019s properties. The knowledge of crafting legendary runes was lost with the fall of the Imperium of Man and only those recovered from ruins and moldering crypts can be transcribed and then, by only the most skilled runesmiths. Some believe that elder elorii retain the knowledge necessary to create new legendary runes, though zealot Sarishans argue that these powerful runes come directly from His divine inspiration. If you wish to use legendary runes in your campaign, they should not be for sale in the village blacksmith shop. They should be found only among the truly wealthy or in the most ancient of fortresses. They should be given as special rewards to only higher level player characters. These items should be given out in much the same context as legendary magic items, and have powers consistent with very rare to legendary items. Like rare and very rare runes, only a single legendary rune may be inscribed in a single item, lest the item simply combust due to the immense magical forces trapped within it.","title":"Entwined Runes"},{"location":"homerules/homerules/magic-items/#rune-stacking","text":"Each rune creates its own unique pattern that cannot operate when combined with duplicates. If the same rune is inscribed on a single item multiple times, only the most powerful version of that rune is active even if there are other forms of that rune inscribed on the item. This limitation also applies to effects that have limited number of uses. Those limits are accessed per item, not per rune, thus inscribing multiple copies of a rune onto an item will not allow you to bypass that limitation. Several runes sheath the object in some form of energy (fire, frost, electricity, etc). An item may be sheathed in only one form of energy at a time; activating another such rune will just change the kind of energy surrounding the item.","title":"Rune Stacking"},{"location":"homerules/homerules/magic-items/#rune-formulas","text":"Much like magic items, runes require formulas for creation. A rune\u2019s formula describes the intricate and delicate process of inscribing the specific pattern of the symbol on the item as well as the ritual required to enchant the rune with magical energy. A runesmith collects many formulas over time, and providing a runesmith with a formula they don\u2019t have is a sure way to get into their good graces. Since each rune comes in different rarities, the formula for creating a rune creates a specific rarity of that rune. A formula to create a thunder rune (uncommon) is different than one for creating a thunder rune (rare). Likewise, the formula for creating amalgamated, blessed and entwined runes is different than the formulas to create the usual versions of the runes in question. So a formula for a blessed necrotic rune (uncommon) is different than a formula for ad entwined necrotic rune (uncommon). No formulas exist for legendary runes; it is thought that the skill needed to create such things has vanished. Creating a rune\u2019s formula is the pinnacle of a runesmith\u2019s art since it captures the unique combination of artistic and magical skill required to inscribe a rune in a way that others can reproduce, if they are skilled enough to understand the formula. In order to create the formula for a rune, a runesmith must have an example of the rune in question and spend twice the amount of gold and time it would cost to inscribe the rune. The rune that provided the basis of the formula is destroyed during this process, along with the item it is inscribed upon.","title":"Rune Formulas"},{"location":"homerules/homerules/magic-items/#learning-runes","text":"During their long training, runesmiths study over the formulas in their master\u2019s collection and dedicate themselves to mastering the craft of inscribing runes. By committing the intricacies of a rune\u2019s formula to memory, eventually a runesmith can learn how to inscribe that rune. Learning a rune in this way takes three times the normal amount of gold and time needed to inscribe it. During this time, the runesmith makes many attempts at creating the physical pattern of the rune and learning the ritual necessary to capture magical energy within its design.","title":"Learning Runes"},{"location":"homerules/homerules/magic-items/#erasing-runes","text":"As part of their training, apprentice runesmiths are often called upon to erase a rune from an item, in preparation for a new one being inscribed. Erasing a rune takes the same amount of time it would to inscribe the rune. This is the best way to learn a rune; while unraveling its pattern and carefully releasing the stored magical energy, a runesmith can learn how to create the rune again. As the last step in erasing a rune, the runesmith must make an Intelligence (Arcana) check, with a DC determined by the rarity of the rune, as show in the table below. On a success, the rune is erased from the item, leaving an empty rune slot, and the runesmith has learned how to inscribe that rune. On a failure, the rune is erased but the runesmith wasn\u2019t able to grasp the intricacies of how it was inscribed.

This process takes a great deal of time and there is always the risk that in the process of erasing the new rune, the runesmith will fail to fully understand it. Runesmiths have created this spell as a solution, allowing them to transfer a rune from one item to another but losing the chance to learn the rune in question. The usual cost for transferring a rune is half of what it would cost to transcribe it but some runesmiths will charge more if they are asked to transfer a rune they do not know. Some runesmiths may even refuse such a request. Rune Descriptions Air Rune, uncommon/rare/very rare Description: Items etched with this rune seem to manipulate the air around them.

It is fashioned after the spiked tail of a manticore and consists of a sheath around the tail, and a bundle of six spikes. History: This spiked tail bracer was not developed until after the Black Talon egg clutch settled in Milandir. Among the clutch\u2019s finest rangers was Tothiss, whose tail was strong and aim was true. When nearby Milandisian villages were attacked by a manticore, she rushed to give aid. For three days and nights she tracked the beast, and finally fought the manticore in its own den. The battle was fierce, and though the manticore perished, Tothiss was crippled and withered by the beast\u2019s poison.

Here, the Tyrant Natus rules a virtual necropolis, populated solely by his deadly sect of holy assassins known as the Breath of Natus. While the lower echelons of the cult are made up of the living, the true terrors of this group are the undead leaders, those who have honed their skill of bestowing the Sacred Death for centuries.

Canceri Champion\u2019s Blade Weapon (greatsword), rare (requires attunement with an oath, see below) Description: These long, graceful swords are black in color, a property of the ore used to make the steel of the blade, and inscribed with benedictions to the three grim gods worshipped by the Cancerese.

To become attuned to one of these blades you must swear a Sarishan oath of loyalty to the Church of the Dark Triumvirate. The attunement process for this weapon also includes a holy quest that the wielder must accomplish. Should the wielder either violate their oath or fail in completing their quest, the weapon will flood their body with necrotic energy, dealing necrotic damage equal to twice their hit point maximum. This damage bypasses all resistances and immunities. If this effect kills the wielder, their soul is trapped within the weapon.

If the trapped soul can convince a wielder of the weapon to complete their failed quest. If this happens, the trapped soul is immediately released to the afterlife.

The blade is forged from magically hardened silver etched with fine silver tracery. History: These war glaives are crafted for the honor guard of Capharran nobility, and are retained by these guards after their retirement. After generations, some have found their way through inheritance, gift, or seizure, throughout the League of Princes. Each is individually named, and the history of these glaives is highly honored by their bearers. Many claim the most ancient glaives were crafted in the Sky Kingdoms, but others doubt this, pointing out that the first recorded glaive was crafted by Naphthala val\u2019Sungha, personal bodyguard to the Prince of Capharra in the third century. The consensus of most scholars is that Naphthala created the first of these items, though the Kio vehemently disagree. Abilities/Effects: You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. Additionally, while wielding this glaive, you may spend your reaction when attacked in melee to grant yourself or an adjacent ally a +2 bonus to AC against the triggering attack.

Culdari \u201cFinal Repose\u201d Weapon (war scythe), legendary (requires attunement by a follower of Neroth) Description: Culdari, called \u201cFinal Repose\u201d, is the holy scythe said to have been once employed by the Valinor, the Hand of Neroth. This legendary weapon appears to be a jet\u00acblack scythe, made of a wood never seen upon the surface of Arcanis. The entire haft is etched in hymns to Neroth, the symbols making serpentine patterns along its length. Pure silver was used to fill each symbol, creating a stark contrast to the dark handle. The top of the haft is mounted with a large skull and from its open mouth projects the silvery-steel scythe blade. History: With the fall of the Imperium of Man, the god Illiir feared for the His children. He looked about and found the Celestial Giants waging a losing battle against the True Dragons and their wyrms. Illiir struck a deal with these giants saying, \u201cWatch over my people, be unto them as protectors and guardians, and I shall save your people\u201d Desperate, the giants agreed and with the bargain struck and the Valinor, the servants of the Gods, took to the skies once more. Titanic battles raged across the continent, with the less powerful wyrms falling quickly to the valinoric host. But the wyrms had numbers on their side, as well as the devastating power of the True Dragons of Arcanis. In the end, the Valinor had to combine their powers, slaying a few of these forces of nature while only able to bind the most powerful of these Dragons into a dreamless slumber. Their own hosts decimated, the Valinor looked across the continent and saw that one last True Dragon remained; its name was Luqun\u2019qun\u2019ovn, and it fell to the Hand of Neroth to face the beast alone. The titanic battle leveled mountains and changed the course of mighty rivers, with neither gaining the advantage. Finally, suffering horrific wounds from Culdari\u2019s long blade, Luqun\u2019qun\u2019ovn fell from the sky. The Hand of Neroth was so in awe of the Dragon, that decided to grant the beast the God of the Dead\u2019s blessing and make the undead Dragon its steed. Unfortunately for the Valinor, it made the mistake of thinking the creature cowed by its defeat. Upon its resurrection, the Dragon swallowed the Valinor whole, entrapping it within its belly before taking flight upon tattered wings. The surviving Valinor arrived in time to see their brother, the Hand of Neroth, reaching for them through the Dragon\u2019s ribcage that now served as his prison, pleading for help. But the Host was too battered and weakened to pursue and battle the now Undead Dragon. Shaken by the loss, the winged angels took flight, leaving the scythe, Culdari forgotten and unclaimed on the battlefield. Abilities/Effects: You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic scythe. It has the following additional properties.

It is imperious and demanding but also dedicated to its purpose \u2014 protecting humanity. It is convinced that the best way to do this is to destroy ever dragon, including such draconic entities as Jeggal Sag and The Fire Dragon. Culdari tends to forget that most mortals cannot withstand such challenges. It is a stern taskmaster but it does have the best interests of humanity at heart A conflict will occur if a dwarf, giant, ssethric, or ss\u2019ressen attempts to attune with Culdari. Also, taking actions that would jeopardize humanity as a whole will prompt a conflict between the weapon and its wielder. See Chapter Nine for the rules and properties of a war scythe.

The sharkskin hilt provides unsurpassed grip and the leaden pommel is stamped with the holy symbol of Yarris, the Lord of the Seas. History: The high seas are home to merchant and miscreant alike; a place where fortunes are won and lost by fire and by sword.

Despair Weapon (war scythe), very rare (requires attunement by an undead creature or worshiper of Neroth) Description: This profane weapon was crafted by the Lich- Lord Hegrish val\u2019Mordane of Sohbuk from the bones of priests from the Mother Church of Coryan. History: Few creatures have shaped the history of Canceri like Hegrish val\u2019Mordane, the longest serving Dark Apostate in Cancerese history thanks to his\u2003 undead nature. During the Heretic Wars, some murmured that a Dark Apostate who sat on his throne while others fought for him was a weakling, speaking with fondness of Arthmoor val\u2019Virdan\u2019s famous death on the front lines. In response Hegrish unveiled Despair, crafted through his own knowledge of arcane arts and calculated to make him appear as Neroth himself on the battlefield, where he reaped the lives of many Milandisians.

Devil King\u2019s Lash Weapon (whip), legendary (requires attunement) Description: This is a long black whip that at first glance appears to be made from tightly braided strips of black leather. Closer inspection reveals the leather to be roughly textured, even scaled, which seems to writhe and recoil under the touch of mortals. Woven into the braided strips are hooks and barbs, fashioned from human bone fragments and designed to flay the flesh from the living with each stroke. At the base of the whip\u2019s blood-stained handle is a human skull. While anyone can wield this weapon, its true powers are only evident to its real masters, those whose blood courses with the taint of Infernal blood. History: During the Time of Terror the mankind was pitted against foul hordes from the Abyss. Hundreds of thousands died during that time as the bloody conflict raged across the Known Lands. The blood of the innocent paid for the eventual decimation of the endless invading forces of Infernals and their generals, each armed with terrible artifacts from their blasted Realm. One such item is the horrid fiery whips used by the Devil Kings to drive forward the Abyssal ranks. Some were taken as trophies of war, while most were confiscated and destroyed by the priests that accompanied the mortal host, assuring that such relics would not corrupt future generations. Sadly, not all were accounted for and these lashes keep turning up in the hands of madmen and butchers. Abilities/Effects: You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.

History: The first of these weapons was created not by a duelist, but by an assassin during the Shadowed Age. Fin Raghnaid might be no more than a legend, but it is said that he visited the fractured ourts of warlords and petty despots, entangling himself in their intrigues and, when necessary, producing a sword from what appeared to be thin air to slay a rival. A limited number of these swords were crafted through the ages, but it was not until the great dueling schools of Savona were founded that they became popular. No longer a weapon of assassins, those dueling schools with a reputation for deadliness over honor popularized these items, and now they can be found in wide variety. Abilities/Effects: All duelists\u2019 surprise weapons are magic weapons, but only the rare variety grants a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls. Both versions of the weapon can be changed from their miniature version to full-sized and back again as a bonus action.

It is possible to find examples of these weapons made of materials other than standard materials, such as adamantine, Sarishan steel and silver. Earthbreaker Weapon (Tralian hammer), legendary (requires attunement) Description: The head of this enchanted Tralian hammer was chiseled out of a single block of black basalt, wrapped in bands of gold, while its long haft is made of ironwood. History: Adelinda val\u2019Tensen was short of stature, but large in spirit. When she joined the cantons, she could barely lift a halberd, and her chain shirt fell to her knees. Taller Milandisians snickered, but she dedicated herself to training every muscle in her body to perfection. Soon she could best any canton in physical combat, and with their support she sought entry into the Tralian Knights. She was rejected due to her height alone. Undaunted, she asked that they grant her combat to prove herself. They set her against their mightiest knight to teach her a lesson. She brought him to the ground with a single blow.

To stave ofl^ disaster without compromising their faith, the Emerald Scales crafted new magical items for their egg clutch, including the first tail bracers. When next they entered battle, these new items allowed them to dominate the enemies of Ssethregore, and made the nagas take notice. Already leery of exterminating the Emerald Scales, the nagas also wanted tail bracers for their other ss\u2019ressen warriors. As more clutches devoted themselves to the Varn, the naga allowed them access to the new weapons as well. When the Black Talons left the Ssethregoran Empire they took several tail bracers with them, making them now common in both the Kraldjur Morass and the Sulfur Marsh. Abilities/Effects: You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.

In darkness, the flail glows with a malevolent aura illuminating everything within 20-feet in a halo of diseased green light. History: Kihuk-Mak was a dark-kin of black reputation beyond the Godswall, where he served as an agent of Uhxbractit\u2019s dictatorship. Enemies of the state were slaughtered by his flail, crafted for him by Uhxbractit\u2019s own forge master. The weapon drank deeply from the blood of the innocent, until one rebel from Bastion unleashed the Word of Xabal in his dying moments. Kihuk-Mak\u2019s compatriots were destroyed, and Kihuk-Mak fell near death. When he recovered, the purity he had felt shook him to his core. In that instant, he realized his taint and the evils he had been party to. A thousand pricks of conscience over the years coalesced into determination.

This group was warred upon almost to extinction by the priestesses of Saluwe and the val\u2019Dellenov family. The death of so many of his order, as well as being prohibited to practice their faith so enraged Kanutus that he vowed vengeance on the Mother Church and the val\u2019Dellenovs. The Myrantians played on his hatred, coaxing Kanutus to craft forestbane, making copies for him and the few remaining druids and embark on a personal war of vengeance against the pristine glades of the empire. For a year Kanutus and his band ravaged the land, evading agents of the val\u2019Dellenovs, and destroying many sacred groves in the process. Though he was eventually arrested and executed, many of the forestbane blades were never recovered.

History: The dwarven warhammer was a weapon of legend, featured prominently in the songs and stories of the enclaves. For centuries, however, no truly great warhammers had been made, beyond the standard magical enchantments any human smith could duplicate. That changed with the return of the Sword of the Heavens and the rise of master smith Berenike of Nol Dappa. As the Erdukeens were experiencing a renewed passion for their history, so Berenike experienced a renewed passion for hers. Already a talented master smith, she was determined to create a warhammer to equal the legendary weapons of old.

She helped unleash a plague of undeath on Balantica, then watched in horror as she learned that few undead matched her memories of her grandfather. They were monsters.

The merchant procured the blade from an unscrupulous treasure hunter named the Silt Fox, a Khur Gi woman, one of the Yhing hir tribes.

Its twisted swept hilt and cage has been forged to look like twisted thorn filled vines. The blade itself has been polished to a mirror finish, across which is the word Harmony in Ancient Altharin. History: Nia Samanya, finest bard of the ancient Tenecian Empire, performed at the dedication of the floating city of Khafre. So fine was her performance that the Council of Wisdom offered her a boon. She asked for a sword, warning that in the shadow of Khafre all would soon require swords. The Council did not like this answer, but unwilling to lose face they had their finest artificers create Harmony. Nia\u2019s request proved prophetic, and she often used her blade in defense of fallen Althre.

Heart\u2019s Fang Weapon (longsword), rare (requires attunement) Description: Looking more like a butcher\u2019s cleaver than a longsword, heart\u2019s fang is a crude looking weapon, made of black iron with red sigils etched along its blade. The hilt is of simple bronze, while the bronze pommel is set with a large ruby. History: According to legend, heart\u2019s fang was the weapon used by the Gar Ormal chieftain during the First War of Extinction against the Issori. After their betrayal at the hands of their allies, the ssethrics, the blade disappeared from history, until it a recently discovered eloran scroll made mention of numerous wars against the gar, where this sword figured prominently. Centuries would pass before it was once again seen, again in the hands of a gar, as these bestial men waged war against the Imperium of Man. In modern times, the chieftain of the marauding Gar Tiche, whose wanderings have them raiding towns and caravans from the western edge of the Corlathian Mountains to the shores of the Lauriol Sea, has been seen wielding a weapon matching Heart\u2019s Fang\u2019s description. This tale contradicts the infamous Ig of the Many Tongues, who claims that heart\u2019s fang is in the hands of a very dangerous warlord of the Gar Dahl, the People of Iron, in far off Quagga. The blade is said to remember every betrayal and sworn enemy of the gar tribes and the spirit within vows to take vengeance upon every member of that race, until they are no more. The spirit demands that blade be heated white hot and then quenched, over and over again, in the hearts of a score of the race it has sworn to destroy This, along with the stories of others possessing Heart\u2019s Fang, lead scholars to conclude that there must be more than one copy of the blade. Ig of the Many Tongues agrees. He believes that while each gar tribe may have made copies of their own, the original Heart\u2019s Fang, the one wielded by the extinct Gar Ormal chieftain, is the one held by the Gar Dahl warlord, for it is covered in sigils and said to hunger for the blood of all that have hunted the gar over the ages. Abilities/Effects: You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. When you hit a val or other creature with celestial blood, the creature takes an extra 3d6 slashing damage.

The blade has a series of runes etched upon it. The golden hilt wraps elegantly around the wielder\u2019s hand forming an intricate basket portraying a mongoose attacking a serpent. Kelisar\u2019s pommel is adorned with a flawless emerald of the deepest green, its perfect balance is apparent to anyone lucky enough to hold this magnificent sword in their hands. History: Kelisar or serpent eater in the Eloran language, is an ancient elorii blade forged by Auros, the legendary elorii warrior that slew the ssanu archmage Ss\u2019koreth. After the elorii overthrew their scaled overlords, the elorii craftsman Ferelas, affixed its distinctive hilt to the blade. Kelisar hung in a place of honor in Belestor, removed only in times of great need, such as the various Ssethric incursions occurring every few centuries. Kelisar was last used in battle against humans during the Great Betrayal, where the reborn hero Auros used it to wound a Valinor. It is not known if the famed blade was taken with retreating elorii forces or if it fell into the hands of their human foes. Abilities/Effects: You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage when attacking with this magical weapon.

Lance of the Errant Knight Weapon (lance), rare Description: Crafted from wood gathered in the Faerdwalden, these lances are often carved with mythical creatures, such as unicorn, or other horned animals, such as the narwhal. History: The woodsmen of the Faerdwalden have made intricately carved lances since before the founding of the Milandisian League, but it was during the reign of Oswald val\u2019Inares, the Usurper, that these works of art became all the rage in the court of Naeraanth. Oswald II granted an enchanted lance carved with a unicorn to Ermingild Traudottir, a knight sworn to his service whom he favored. Ermingild secretly loathed the line of the Usurper, but was bound by her duty to the king. She served Oswald II until the end, then exiled herself in penance and wandered the land as a knight errant. As the Faerdwalden lances, seen as symbols of the Usurper\u2019s reign, fell out of style at court, her noble actions brought them a different reputation, and many knights errant now seek out similarly enchanted lances to follow in her footsteps. Abilities/Effects: You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magical lance; this bonus increases to +2 when you are directly protecting the defenseless.

Lantas Dalo: Cleaver of Trolls Weapon (longsword, unique), very rare (requires attunement) Description: Lantas Dalo appears to be the perfect longsword with a heavy, over weighted tip to smash through the rocky carapace of Singarthan Trolls. The handle is carved from straight-grained ironwood and the pommel capped with a replica of a gauntleted fist. Dwarven runes cover the blade; retelling the tale of the troll invasion of Solanos Mor, while a multitude of small diamonds encrust the hilt causing the hilt to sparkle in the light. History: Lantas Dalo was forged a century ago by Master Smith Elebac of Solanos Mor. At the time of its forging, the city fell under siege by a horde of Singarthan Trolls that swept down out of the Corlathian Mountains and into the numerous tunnels that riddle that mountain range. The siege lasted for one hundred days until the valiant defenders of the City of Shameful Penance finally drove off or destroyed the troll host, but not before suffering heavy casualties. Master Elebac soon learned that his eldest son had fallen in the battle. Heartbroken, Elebac swore vengeance and returned to the unfinished sword in his forge with unbridled determination and fury. When the blade neared completion, Elebac had the city guard bring a live troll before him. This Singarthan Troll was the warlord Thragris, captured on the field of battle and imprisoned before his broken body could recover. As the last hammer blow rang upon the blade, Thragris was set free and Elebac turned to face the unfettered Troll lord. \u201cMy vengeance begins at the source!\u201d shouted Elebac as he waded into battle, the sword\u2019s blade still glowing red-hot. Thragris never stood a chance. Afterwards, Elebac pulled the now cool sword from the ruined body of the troll and looked upon the finished blade. He raised the sword above his head and, in a soft voice, christened the new blade Lantas Dalo, the Cleaver of Trolls. Elebac then strode across the cavern to his eldest daughter, Betra, and presented the sword to her hilt first. \u201cDuty binds me here to continue my craft, but take up this sword my daughter, and avenge your brother and all the others who fell to these beasts,\u201d said Elebac. And with that, Elebac strode back to his forge to continue perfecting his craft, while Betra girded for war and left Solanos Mor on her own crusade.

Lion of Winter Weapon (longsword, unique), legendary (requires attunement by the head of the val\u2019Tensen family) Description: This longsword\u2019s blade is ice blue, as if made of solidified cold, with an elegant pattern etched along the flat side. The elaborate cross guard is fashioned to resemble a lion\u2019s head, complete < with fur to simulate its mane. History: This longsword has been in the hands of the val\u2019Thnsen family since the days of the Imperium of Man. But since the sundering of the val\u2019Tensen line after the secession of Milandir from the Coryani Empire, the sword has made its displeasure known by killing anyone attempting to take the blade from its scabbard who was not the rightful leader of that family. The governor of the Coryani province of Ulfila, Augustos Titus val\u2019Thnsen, determined to humiliate his separatist cousins by wielding the blade and thus proving that they were no longer a part of the family had his blood freeze in his veins upon taking the sword from its sheath. Emboldened, the newly crowned Duke\u2003 of Moratavia took possession of the sword and suffered the same fate when he attempted to wield the sword. Fearful that none were now worthy of claiming the sword, it was given to the monastic Order of the Blade, where it will remain until the true head of the family comes forth to claim it.

Mastbreaker Weapon (bardiche), rare (requires attunement) Description: This gruesome bardiche has been pieced together using the masts and metalwork from the first ship the pirate captain Yacobin Bike plundered. History: Most pirates from the Pirate Isles refrain from preying on each other, but not so Yacobin Bike. He was a boy when his crew was betrayed to the Coryani by fellow pirates. Yacobin escaped execution and swore all the world would be his target, particularly fellow pirates. He stole his first ship, then stole a better one. The first time he plundered a fellow pirate he ripped apart the mast and metalwork of her ship, and reforged them into a bardiche. Now he is a legend to be feared. His swift ship draws near under cover of darkness or fog, and then Yacobin himself swims silently aboard.

You gain a +10 bonus to any Strength checks made to break through doors, barricades, and other barriers. Moon Blade Weapon (longsword), very rare (requires attunement by a val\u2019Dellenov) Description: This curved blade, meant to represent the crescent moon, shimmers and glows like a moonbeam. History: The val\u2019Dellenov family, being scions of the goddess Saluwe, feel a deep connection to nature and the beasts that roam the land. Many can tap into the power of their heritage, calling forth many aspects of animals to aid them. When learning to use their abilities, they are taught to always retain control, but a few are unable to resist the dark lure of giving into the more savage side of nature and revel unabashedly in it. One of the most infamous killers in the empire was Luciana Titus val\u2019Dellenov, a woman who allowed the primal urges of the wild to overwhelm her, hunting down her fellow man as a wolf hunts prey. She was eventually captured and tried by the Mother Church for heresy, after which she was promptly burnt alive. Various random acts of murder and mayhem soon followed, which were blamed on rampaging humanoid wolves that turned back into normal humans at first light. Many point to Luciana\u2019s death curse as the root of this lycanthropic scourge. Altherian scholars scoff at the idea that lycanthropy is a curse that can be spread through bites from the infected, and believe instead this is a blood curse aimed at those who witnessed Luciana\u2019s death, which was passed down to their descendants. If they are correct, then there may be many thousands of potential victims, as the execution was conducted just outside the walls of Grand Coryan, with many thousands in attendance. Others believe that the blood curse is perpetuated by a secretive group known as the Conclave of the Claw that believes that unleashing the beast within all of us is the true representation of Saluwe\u2019s will. Seeing this as a stain upon their family honor, the val\u2019Dellenov train members of the family to be hunt down those afflicted by this curse, just as they pursue other shapechangers, such as the wererats that infest cities. Due to the inherent dangers involved in the slaying a shapechanger, these hunters are issued a moon blade. Within the Golden Boughs of Saluwe is a shrine to a little known aspect of Saluwe, the Lady of Moonlight. Here, Saluwean priestesses enact a ritual consecrating a blade on the first night that Viridis, the green moon, is full. The owner of the blade stands vigil throughout the night, which culminates when the blade is immersed in a hallowed reflecting pool as it catches the last of the moon\u2019s glow. Retrieving it from the cool waters, the blade shimmers with the glow of a moonbeam, feeling almost weightless in the owner\u2019s grasp.\u2003 Abilities/Effects: You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon, which increases to +2 when fighting shapechangers. Furthermore, the blade shimmers a pale green whenever any shapechanger, regardless of form, approaches within 60 feet. Any shapechanger that is successfully struck with this weapon must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or be forced to revert to their original form and be unable to shift form until the next dawn. Finally, the blade can cause the tracks of shapechangers to shimmer with a pale moon-lit glow. This grants you advantage on Wisdom (Survival) checks made to track shapechangers. Screaming Sword Weapon (longsword), legendary (requires attunement) Description: The actual appearance of a screaming sword varies greatly; however, all incorporate a jagged piece of crystal. The type and color of the crystal depends on where the wailing stone was discovered. For example, green and blue crystals are common throughout the Corlathian Mountains, but Thandras, Givahi val\u2019Ishi\u2019s personal blade, was fashioned from a blood-red crystal. Regardless of the crystal used, these blades are magically hardened and sharpened to preserve their cutting edge. The design of the hilt is chosen by the creator, although most incorporate some type of geometric design that follows the shape of the bound crystal. History: In the days immediately following the curse that turned Celestial Giants to the dwarves, they found that most souls passed on to oblivion when they died, though a few became trapped in crystal deposits near the enclaves where the dwarves gathered. Val psions later discovered that these stones, charged with the energy of dwarven souls, could be tapped to power psionic items, though doing so released the soul within. Givahi val\u2019Ishi of Enpebyn, a brilliant val artificer found a way of permanently sealing the energy within the stones. Givahi further refined this sealing technique to allow him to infuse his own power within the crystal alongside the soul energy, creating the first screaming sword in 123 I.C. The techniques developed by Givahi vaFIshi spread quickly among the val, to the point where the dwarves demanded that all such stones be turned over to them, so that they could be given a place of rest within the Chamber of Final Repose, leading to one of the few modern conflicts between the Solani dwarves and the Coryani Empire. All dwarves bear a great hatred towards anyone seen wielding one of these blades. Abilities/Effects: You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. When you attack psionically awakened creatures or creatures whose natural attacks deal psionic damage, this bonus increases to +3. Also, whenever you make an attack using this weapon, all sentient creatures within 20 feet can telepathically \u201chear\u201d the weapon moaning, muttering, and screaming in their minds; these noises do not cause any benefits or penalties, but most creatures find them unsettling and disturbing. Psiscream: A screaming sword has 3 charges. While holding the weapon, as a bonus action you may expend 1 charge to force each creature in a 15-foot radius to make a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 2d8 psychic damage and is pushed 10 feet away from you. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and is not pushed. This sword regains 1 charge daily at dawn. Sea Rover Weapon (scimitar), rare (requires attunement) Description: This scimitar is crafted of Milandisian steel and has a crescent guard inlaid with mother-of-pearl and coral. Its hilt is wrapped in sharkskin to give it a strong grip, while the end of the pommel is set with a pure aquamarine gemstone. History: Though many who craft this weapon in Savona and the League of Princes do not know its history, those in Naeraanth tell of Merireiks val\u2019Ossan, the wild centurion who had as many disciplinary actions as he had awards of honor, who once wrestled a shark bare-handed, and who crafted Sea Rover with a Savonan artificer on a drunken dare. He was sent with the legions to quell the Eppion rebellion, and while stationed in Metra he fell in love with an Undir who shared his interest in artificing and the sea, and who learned the falchion\u2019s secret. When the legion left Metra she declined to go with him, and after many more campaigns, Merireiks finally retired to Naeraanth. The original Sea Rover is still used by the Dolphin Guard. Abilities/Effects: You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. While holding this falchion, you may stand on and move across any liquid surface as if it were solid ground (when crossing molten lava or some other dangerous surface, you can still take damage from heat or fumes).\u2003 Shadow Mother Weapon (longsword), legendary (requires attunement) Description: This black longsword is unique in the fact that its matte black finish seems to drink up all light around it. The material does not rust or tarnish, and always appears to be the deepest possible black. The blade itself is forged with deep fullers carved into the blade to drain the blood of its victims. History: Osvaldus Ephrem had one goal in life: Power. He falsely joined the temple of Cadic to gain access to the Shadowstone, rumored to be a crystalized Valinor of the dark god. He stole the Shadowstone and crafted a sword to steal the essence of the Valinor and bind it to his own soul. But the Shadowstone was not a Valinor of Cadic. It was not a Valinor at all. It was an artifact of death beyond Osvaldus\u2019s ability to control. That was when the Cadician assassins struck, putting down Osvaldus\u2019s heresy, but not before he had finished his creation. They took Shadow Mother for further study, but the cursed blade overwhelmed the wielder, who slew several of his brethren before escaping. Abilities/Effects: You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. When you hit with an attack using this weapon the target takes an additional ldlO necrotic damage with the wielder of the weapon suffering half of the necrotic damage dealt to the target. Curse: This weapon is cursed, a fact that is revealed only when an identify spell is cast on the sword or you attune to it. Once attuned up, you feel a constant desire to use this weapon to kill others and must succeed at a DC 10+1 per character level Charisma saving throw to use any other weapon while you are bearing this weapon. To drop or stop being attuned to this weapon requires a DC 20 Charisma saving throw, with a failed save preventing the wielder from dropping the weapon and triggering a Rage per the Barbarian class ability. Should the wielder of this weapon ever be reduced to 0 hit points or lower, their soul is pulled from their body into the blade. While in this form, the soul is still in control of the body\u2014 which is not considered to be an undead\u2014but separate from it. Without the soul present in the body, it is now has resistance to healing effects, only being healed for half the amount rolled. While in this form, the body does not require food or drink, as the energy of the sword keeps it sustained. While in this form, whenever shadow mother deals necrotic damage to a target, the wielder\u2019s body is healed the full amount of the necrotic damage dealt. If the wielder of this blade does not kill another creature before midnight every day, the body of the wielder has its hit point maximum reduced by 5 as the magical connection to their body withers away. For each 5 hit points drained from the body, it begins to look increasingly skeletal until it looks little more than a desiccated mummy. At this point, should the body ever be reduced to 0 hit points by any means, the wielder is permanently killed and the soul is forever trapped in the sword. Sickle Sword of the Myrantian Lord Weapon (khopesh), legendary (requires attunement) Description: The lapis-lazuli inlayed into the ivory hilt of this sickle is stained by the blood of the countless creatures slain by this hungry blade. Slightly tarnished and notched, the iron blade of this khopesh is still sharp. History: This sword was created not by a Myrantian, but by Blasius Toranestus, Coryani governor of the province of Toranesta. He styled himself as one of the Phaerons of old, and commissioned Caecus val\u2019Abebi, a Coryani artificer, to fashion him a weapon reminiscent of the royal khopesh held by the ruler of ancient Myrantis. Blasius\u2019s love of all things Myrantian did not extend to its people, and his oppressed provincials eventually slew him with his own sickle sword. The sword was later stolen from Coryani custody and delivered anonymously to the new governor of Toranesta, still stained with Blasius\u2019s blood. Each future Coryani governor found a similar khopesh delivered to them, as a warning, and a similar weapon is now held by the Phaeron of the Abessian Dominion. Abilities/Effects: You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. Any time you reduce a creature to 0 hit points with this weapon, the target is instantly killed. Additionally, when you roll a 20 on an attack roll made with this weapon, you may force the target to make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or fall dead. Once used, this ability cannot be used again until the next dawn. If this weapon is held by anyone who is not of Myrantian ethnicity, they suffer 3dl0 points of necrotic damage every turn while this weapon is held. See Chapter Nine for the rules and properties of a khopesh.\u2003 Spear of Wind and Wave Weapon (spear), rare (requires attunement) Description: This spear consists of a palm-wood haft set with a broad edged tip fashioned from magically hardened coral. History: Two elorii Laerestri were spying on several Ymandrake agents when they were captured and forced unto one of the Black Ships bound for the Isle of Tears. Fortunately, a Milandisian naval captain, Nevis val\u2019Ossan, rescued them while leading an attack that resulted in sending the Ymandrakes into Yarris\u2019s cold grasp, one of the few victories the Milandisians scored against the Black Fleet. It is said that the grateful elorii fashioned an additional copy of this weapon for the captain as a token of their gratitude. Abilities/Effects: You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. In addition, while held you gain a swim speed of 30 feet and the ability to breathe underwater. Spell Spinner Weapon (longsword, unique), legendary (requires attunement) Description: This blade is a long, slightly curved, double edged longsword. The cross guard, a classic double ring, and pommel are solid gold. The haft of the blade is carved ironwood depicting cats at play. History: Spell spinner was discovered in the ruins under the First City by the Warrior Sage Vinas val\u2019Mehan of the Emerald Society. Vinas was able to successfully date the blade\u2019s design back to the beginning of Imperium of Man, but the weapon\u2019s powers remained largely a mystery to him until the expedition crossed paths with an ancient undead horror while returning to the surface. During the battle, the creature unleashed a series of destructive spells, one fired directly at Vinas\u2019 chest. Reflexively, he raised the blade to block the blow, and, to everyone\u2019s amazement, deflected the eldritch bolt back, destroying the creature. From that point forth, the blade became a fixture at his side, but upon his death, Vinas ordered the blade be given to the Emperor of Coryan as a gift. The messenger and the blade never made it to Grand Coryan however, and Spell Spinner has been lost ever since. Abilities/Effects: You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. If you are targeted by a spell, you may spend your reaction to attempt a DC 15 Dexterity check to interpose the blade between you and the spell.

These whips were given to them by their ssanu masters and used to deliver punishment to those elorii who failed to obey orders.

Danai val\u2019Emman and Vasilios val\u2019Virdan, friends and craftsmen, together forged a mighty greatsword, they named Triumph.

Addertongue Weapon (blowgun), very rare Description: Fashioned from the hollowed stem of a rare desert plant, the blowgun is about 4 feet in length and carven to resemble a serpent. History: The Pengik have used their signature long blowguns from time immemorial. Even before other humans came to Onara, Ichna\u2019gi shamans would use the blowguns as instruments to emit strange droning sounds that carried messages for miles across the Flinterlands. But while many Pengik used darts tipped with\u2003 deadly poisons in their blowguns, it was only during the Time of Terror that the first addertongue was created. The Ichna\u2019gi shamans were reluctant to alter their traditional weapons, but they finally relented in order to counter the greater threats of the infernal-ruled world. Today addertongues are primarily found among shamans, though some warriors carry them as well, while others have been traded to outsiders.

History: Altherians are never satisfied. Having learned the secrets of blastpowder, it was only a matter of time before they sought to maximize this gift. Pallas val\u2019Abebi, a young artificer, stumbled upon the secret of this flintlock early in his career, and with the abandon of youth he developed it. While the Council of Wisdom acknowledged his craftsmanship, they felt that the weapon took Althares\u2019 precious gift for granted, and would incur his wrath. After the Battle of Semar however, necessity forced the Altherians to reconsider Pallas\u2019s creation. They have begun manufacturing Althares\u2019gifts for the Shining Patrol and certain favored others. It remains to be seen if Altheria will once again pay a price for such hubris. Abilities/Effects: You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. You may use your action to load this weapon and say a prayer to Althares. This causes the weapon to lose its loading property and allow it to be fired 1d4+1 times before needing to be reloaded.

Once the weapon is out of shots, you may either fire it as a normal flintlock or use another action to invoke Althares\u2019 blessing. Bow of the Five Peoples Weapon (longbow), very rare (requires attunement) Description: Tassels of preserved leaves and fine runes decorate the ends of this birch bow. History: The first of these bows were created by Arfeas, the renowned artificer of Malfea. These bows are given as high honors to elorii who prove themselves worthy, normally by slaying humans during the never-ending Malfelen War of Vengeance. Almost immediately the bows began appearing in Elonbe and Entaris as well.

Weapon (longbow), very rare (requires attunement) Description: This eloran longbow is exquisitely crafted to resemble winged dragons and made of enchanted silver, giving it the flexibility of a normal wooden bow. History: Among the elorii who fought on behalf of Yahssremore few were as feared as the Wyrm Riders, who rode their namesakes into battle and traveled in the company of the great wyrms. For this elite unit, the first silverbows were created by ssethric artificers, forged from the silver ore of the mountains where the drakes dwelled. The elorii no longer capture or ride drakes, nor have they allied with wyrms since their rebellion. Like most of their history as slaves, the elorii are not proud of the actions of the Wyrm Riders. The silverbows themselves, however, were too valuable to abandon, and their sculpted dragons remain as a reminder of the ancient past. Abilities/Effects: You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. When you hit with an attack with this weapon, it deals an additional ld6 cold damage. Any creature you attack with this bow with vulnerability to cold damage must make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or gain the paralyzed condition until the end of their next turn. Thunderbow Weapon (longbow), rare (requires attunement) Description: This longbow is constructed from hollow tubing and has a strange aquamarine hue, with accents molded into it that are reminiscent of avian wings. Each time a thunderbow is fired, its hollow construction creates a deep resonant booming that sounds like distant thunder. History: In the aftermath of the rebellion of Eppion, the Coryani took a renewed interest in the League of Princes, and a brief period ensued where imitation Kio styles were all the rage in the city of Savona. Enthralled by this style, Xaviera val\u2019Sheem, who despite her family was an adherent of Hurrian, crafted the beautiful thunderbow as a signature weapon for her swashbuckling adventures. The adventuring life hardened her, and within a decade she was no longer so concerned with frivolous beauty and elegance. She eventually sold the bow to an artificer from Ulfila. Abilities/Effects: You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic bow. As a bonus action, you may charge a nocked arrow with the power of the storm and fire it at a target within range.

History: In the Far West, the Mad Magi of Lakhrion are a scourge upon the people of that region. To defend themselves, the various city-states that dot the area scavenge through ruins, crypts and barrows for these daggers to curry the favor of the Coven of the Wailing Sisters, a group of women who have suffered at the hands of the Mad Magi. These sorceresses, while able to wield arcane might, are not as skillful as their sworn enemy and find that the daggers boost their abilities. Like a pack of wolves, they harry their nemeses en masse as the Sisters know that even with the daggers, they are no match for more than one or two of the Magi. Abilities/Effects: This is a magic weapon which may be used as an arcane focus. This dagger possesses 3 charges. When casting a spell while using this weapon as an arcane focus, you may spend a bonus action and 1 charge to increase the effect of that spell as if you cast using a spell slot one level higher. This dagger regains ld3 of its spent charges daily at dawn. Bandoleer of Foe Daggers Weapon (daggers), uncommon (requires attunement) Description: These broad belts of Canceri design, are meant to be worn over the shoulder and across the breast. Crafted from finely tooled leather that is inlayed and decorated to make them appear as if the wearer is being consumed by a demon; with the creature\u2019s teeth replaced by eight daggers. History: Despite its appearance this bandoleer was not crafted by the Sarishans, but rather by the Nierites of northern Canceri. Borbala Soroka created the first belt during the First Crusade, containing a single knife deadly to fiends. Over centuries other Nierites crafted variations of the item, improving on Borbala\u2019s original enchantments. By the time of the Cancerese insurrection there were dozens of variations being made. With the Nierites forming the backbone of the new Cancerese military, however, artificers were encouraged to work together to create new items for the brave warriors. During such a council, the best features of many bandoleer designs were combined into the modern one, with eight daggers. Abilities/Effects: This bandoleer contains 8 magical daggers, each one imbued to do additional damage to a specific creature type. Each dagger deal an additional 1d6 piercing damage to its respective creature type. The creature types the daggers are imbued against are: aberrations, beasts, constructs, goblinoids, giants, infernals, monstrosities and ssethrics. Additionally, when performing a ranged attack using any of these daggers, the dagger returns to your hand immediately after the attack. This allows you to perform multiple attacks with the dagger using the same action, as long as you have a feature or ability that grants multiple attacks. Weapon (mace), very rare (requires attunement by a follower ofBeltine) Description: This is mace is made of strips of the highest- grade steel, painstakingly folded hundreds of times and wrapped to create the head of the mace. It has a long handle to counterbalance the heavy head, allowing it to be both a one-handed and two-handed weapon. History: Deimas val\u2019Ishi was a Beltinian Hospitaler whose skill in battle and devotion to Beltine were legendary, and matched only by her arrogance. In her hubris, she declared that she would reclaim the Twin Citadels ofBeltine and Neroth in the Blessed Lands, and reopen these holy shrines to the pilgrims. Against the wishes of her order she marched with fifty soldiers into the Blessed Lands. Only she emerged, bearing Beltine\u2019s Kiss. Attempts to question her were fruitless. Deimas val\u2019Ishi\u2003 had become quite mad. Scholars note that the mace does not appear to be ancient, however, indicating that either she had crafted it, or it had been crafted recently by someone, or something, else. Abilities/Effects: You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic mace. When you hit an undead creature with this weapon, it takes an extra 2d6 radiant damage. Should that undead have 25 hit points or fewer after taking this damage, it must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be destroyed. Clubs of Deuce Weapon (pair of clubs), very rare (requires attunement) Description: These twin belaying pins are elaborately carved from ironwood and with highlights lacquered in either red or blue to symbolize fire and ice. History: Many Solani dwarves reject the path of the perfect item, and instead follow the path of penitence. Among these was Baraut, who dedicated his life to the defense of humanity. His adventures took him to Coryan, where he found the poorest plebeians lived lives of fear in the slums. Baraut became their protector, never giving his name or asking for reward. The narrow alleys of the city made his traditional warhammer unwieldy, so he crafted these clubs. Many criminals preying on the poor learned to fear the flash of fire and ice as Baraut\u2019s clubs ricocheted off close-set walls to find their target. Abilities/Effects: These clubs are considered to be a single weapon for attunement. While welding both clubs in combat you gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage when attacking and possess the ability to deal bludgeoning or piercing damage with these magic weapons. Unlike common clubs, the clubs of deuce possess the thrown property with a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 40 feet. When you hit with a ranged attack utilizing either of these clubs it deals an additional 1d8 fire or cold damage, depending on which one of the two clubs where thrown. Immediately after the attack, the club flies back to your hand. Cradok Durass \u201cEarthshaker\u201d Weapon (great club), very rare (requires attunement) Description: The heavy steel head is carved to resemble a bull, the flat of the maul crafted as the bull\u2019s forehead. From the stomach of the bull extends a long, dark haft of ironwood, carved with runes of power. The pommel is a simple steel ring from which a lanyard hangs. History: On a rainy evening, a huge figure lumbered out of the night and approached a Shining Patrol station in the no man\u2019s land between the Ssethregoran Empire and the Altherian Republic. As the figure entered the dim illumination from the firelight, it was revealed to be an Ibon, an eight-foot-tall, yellow crested humanoid, dressed and girded for war. The Altherian soldiers, dumbfounded, reached for their weapons in preparation for a fight. The Ibon, looking unconcerned sat down at the fire, and began to prepare a meal. Perplexed, the men questioned the hungry giant as to its intentions. In perfect Low Coryani, responded, \u201cYou need all the help you can get against these snakes and I\u2019m very good at killing things\u2026 for a price.\u201d This was the beginning of one of the oddest arrangements in the history of the Shining Patrol. It seems that the Ibon, named Radjuborn, used to be an indentured slave/body guard for a Ymandrake \u2018merchant\u201d. His master was killed while traveling through the southern provinces of the Coryani Empire and Radjuborn decided to seek employment elsewhere. He had heard of the Shining Patrol and how they accepted anyone regardless of nationality, race or background and decided to join where he could be guaranteed constant food and shelter. It took some time and many solo forays by Radjuborn across the border to prove himself, but eventually he was accepted into the Patrol. Radjuborn swung Cradok Durass with bone shattering force, and the last sight of many Ssethregorans was the great club shattering their shield before smashing into them. Many of his fellow patrolmen asked about the incredible weapon, but all he would say was that it was given to him by his previous employer, a sorcerer of some lepule. After two decades of battling the ssethrics, he rose to be an officer, before finally being dragged down during an ambush. It took over a dozen Agamassi ss\u2019ressen to finally overwhelm\u2003 him, but it was there that Radjuborn\u2019s legend was writ, as he made a last stand to allow those under his command to escape. He was last seen beneath a veritable hill of the large lizard men, his famed shield, Cradok Morket torn from his grasp, while still swinging his great club. Abilities/Effects: You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magical great club. When you roll a 20 on an attack roll with this weapon, the target takes an extra 2d8 bludgeoning damage. In addition, when targeting a creature with a shield you may make an attack roll with disadvantage to strike the shield instead of the creature. If the attack hits, the creature takes no damage but their shield is destroyed. If the creature is using a magical shield, the creature must drop it but it remains intact. Dagger of One Thousand Cuts Weapon (dagger), very rare (requires attunement) Description: This finely crafted dagger appears for all appearances like a simple dagger. However, whenever it is thrown, or swung about, a swarm of partially real daggers seems to flow after it. History: This finely crafted dagger was as a gift by the mage Telven, to a rogue lost an arm while protecting him. This rogue was a master at wielding twin daggers in combat, but the loss of his left arm left him at quite the disadvantage. Feeling somewhat responsible for his friend\u2019s predicament, Telven fashioned a new, and quite special dagger for his friend. Abilities/Effects: You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. If you use this weapon to make a ranged attack and your attack hits, add ld4+l dice to your damage roll. If you score a critical hit, these additional dice are doubled as normal. Additionally, when you use this weapon to make a ranged attack, the weapon flies back to your hand immediately after the attack. Demonsbane Weapon (dagger), very rare (requires attunement) Description: This is a curved dagger, its steel stained sickly red by infernal blood. The edge appears ragged and corroded, yet it neither crumbles away nor grows dull. The hilt is wrapped with thin strips of white cloth, each printed with fine invocations and sigils of protection against Infernals. History: While this dagger is normally found among Sarishans and those who hunt Infernals, it was first created by the blasphemous Seekers of the Hidden Master. Though these heretics consort with demons, they are not stupid, and crafted the first such daggers in case their Infernal patrons preferred slaughter to bargains. The dagger must be crafted precisely, according to arcane geometry and wrapped in sigils of protection. The Seekers use blasphemous infernal litanies for this, though others tend to use cants of binding from the temple of Sarish. Finally, the dagger must be tempered in the blood of an unbound infernal. This last requirement accounts for the rarity of the dagger, even after the unsealing of the north. Abilities/Effects: You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. This bonus increases to +3 when you use this dagger to attack an infernal. Furthermore, while holding this weapon you gain advantage on saving throws made against spells cast by infernals or those with tainted blood, such as a dark-kin. Doomherald Weapon (hand axe), very rare (requires attunement) Description: This magnificent hand axe represents the pinnacle of forging technology known to the dwarves of Tultipet. Like many superior magical weapons of dwarven manufacture, the blade is made from ingots of green-iron and black-iron steel, superheated then compressed, folded and magically cooled hundreds of times, ensuring a durable and razor sharp edge. The center of its blade is carved out, leaving a hollow space behind the edge, with a haft of ribbed ironwood and a chain to secure the weapon against a possible slip. History: Duleng Firand of Tultipet crafted this axe under the inspiration of an oracular dream. He did not know why he was so compelled, but he felt a great dread from the vision, naming the axe Doomherald. Both he and his apprentices used the axe as a template for other creations, but the original always stayed in his forge, waiting for its time. That time finally came when the great dragon, Villa\u2019tavorentes, exacted his revenge and destroyed the enclave of Tultipet. Finally, Duleng knew the purpose of his vision. He has abandoned the forge to wander the land,\u2003 his axe does heralding the doom of not the True Dragon that devastated his home and people, but the humans and their descendants that released it. Abilities/Effects: You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage when attacking with this magic weapon. While this weapon is held, you may use an action to see through up to 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt for up to 10 minutes. This axe has the thrown property with a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet. When you hit with a ranged attack using this weapon it deals an extra ld8 thunder damage or, if the target is a giant, 2d8 thunder damage. When used to make a ranged attack, this axe immediately returns to your hand once the attack is finished. Fangs of Vapriss Weapon (javelin), rare Description: These weapons are built from the bones of serpents and have been enchanted so as to transform into serpents when thrown in combat. History: These javelins were created during the elorii uprising and used with great efficacy by the ruthless ssanu general, Vapriss, the Venom of Yig. This holy champion of the Ssethric deity delighted in taking elorii skulls as trophies, which she would hang on a specially crafted net that covered her long, sinuous body. She commanded the artificers of Yahssremore to create javelins that changed shape into a likeness of her blessed goddess. She particularly terrified the elorii for she dedicated every elorii killed as a tribute to the goddess Yig. To this day, none of the elorii souls killed by Vapriss has been resurrected through the Orumar. Abilities/Effects: This javelin is a magical weapon. When you hurl it and speak the command word, it transforms into a large viper and attacks your intended target at the beginning of your turn for 8 turns, or until your intended target is dead. When either of these conditions occurs, the viper dissolves into green mist, reappearing as a javelin in your hand. Once this ability is used it cannot be called upon again until the next dawn, though the javelin continues to function as a magical weapon. For stats on the giant viper, use the snake (poisonous, giant) stats from the Core rules. Forger of Chains Weapon (dagger), rare (requires attunement) Description: This dagger has a cross guard shaped like the gaping mouth of a fiend, with the blade sticking out of its mouth as if it were its tongue. This cross guard is connected to a bracelet worn by the wearer, while the blade is inscribed with Sarishan sigils. History: During the Time of Terror, when the infernal hordes marched south, there was a great need to study unbound infernals to develop tactics against them. Ceren val\u2018Mehan saw an opportunity to gain a profit while also increasing humanity\u2019s knowledge of these fiends. She crafted the first of these weapons, and became renowned as an infernal bounty hunter. For a princely sum, she and her mercenary band would hunt down an unbound infernal of the type desired, paralyze it with forger of chains, and drag it back to civilization to be studied, enslaved, or dissected as their patrons wished. It was not long before the infernals learned of this and began hunting her down, at which point she decided she had earned enough wealth and retired, leaving the weapon to her prot\u00e9g\u00e9. Abilities/Effects: This Sarishan steel bladed bracer is a\u2003 must make DC 12 Charisma saving throw or be magically bound within a cocoon of energy, gaining the paralyzed condition but being protected from all outside forces. The bound creature remains cocooned for 7 days; this duration is reduced by 1 day for every CR of the creature, with creatures with a CR greater than 6 breaking free from the blade\u2019s binding power at the end of their next turn. While you may only bind one creature at a time, as a reaction you may choose to shed your own blood with the weapon, utilizing your blood to empower the binding. For every 10 hit points of damage you sacrifice, you increase the duration of the creature\u2019s entrapment 1 day. This damage may not be healed while the creature is bound by this weapon. For the worn weapon quality see Chapter Nine under new weapons. Kur\u2019s Tooth Weapon (spear), very rare (optional attunement) Description: This magical spear appears to be crudely made, its point made of unnaturally hard, carved and scrimshawed horn. History: About the ancient Yahssremoran city of Tasmek ranged the nomadic Gar known as the Gar Kur. These Gar were constantly harried by undead created by the ssethric necromancer-priests of Wantir, the God of the Death. Within Tasmek, these reptilian necromancers created undead servants, some of which rose again as intelligent undead, unsuitable to their needs and cast them out into the wilderness. With so many Gar falling prey to these undead, the shamans of the tribe gathered to create a weapon to protect their people. In a dark ritual, they invoked the spirits and consecrated the spear by using it to sacrifice their chieftain. The blood- soaked spear was given to the chieftain\u2019s eldest, to hunt down and destroy the undead. But a weapon created by black magic cannot be used for long without tainting the wielder. The spear awakened and whispered its secrets to the tribe\u2019s new leader. It tempted him with more power, enough to challenge the might of priests of Wantir. Eventually, the Gar chieftain led a raid with many of his own raised from the dead and began slaughtering the ssethrics of Tasmek. The High Priest of Wantir, Prasshk, was forced to call for assistance to fend off the attack and as well as take back control of the city, as the dead now outnumbered the living. In the end the empire had to raze the entire city to the ground. The Gar Kur were exterminated, though the spear was never found. Abilities/Effects: You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. Optional Attunement: If you choose to become attuned to this spear and are not attuned to any other weapons, Kur\u2019s Tooth begins to whisper to you, revealing its greater power. Eventually, as an action the spear grants you the ability to call forth a wave of necrotic energy that you may focus on one of two effects: You may force all undead with a CR of 2 or lower within 60 feet to make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the undead is utterly destroyed. Undead who succeed on this save or have a CR greater than 2 are unaffected. You may use this energy to cast animate dead, creating three skeletons who follow your commands until the next dawn. Once either of these abilities is used, neither may be used again until the next midnight. Legionspear Weapon (spear), rare Description: The legionspear, called a pilum by the legionnaires, is a primarily a throwing spear, though it can be used in melee, if necessary. History: When Aneas val\u2019Assante was made general of the Legion of the Triumphant Rays of the Invincible Sun, the legion had been nearly destroyed in the recent Coryani-Ymandrake war. Aneas reorganized the legion from the ground up, developing new tactics focusing on the pilum. Playing on the legion\u2019s name, he trained his men to throw the pilum in tandem, like the triumphant rays of the sun flashing out at the darkness. The Emperor was impressed that Aneas had salvaged a legion so near destruction, and granted him resources that the general used to make the first legionspears for his best commanders. Abilities/Effects: You gain a +1 bonus to ranged attack and damage rolls made with this magical weapon. Furthermore, while throwing this spear, if you hit a creature with this weapon in the same round that one of your allies hit the same creature with a ranged attack, you deal an additional ld6 piercing damage. Mercy Weapon (quarterstajf, unique), legendary (requires attunement by a val\u2019Ishi) Description: Smoothed by centuries of use, this stout, undecorated, oaken staff is a blessed weapon of the Flealer aspect of Beltine. History: The origins of the necrotic plague that swept the southern reaches of the Imperium of Man\u2003 are unknown. Some blamed Ssethregoran bio-engineering, or an infernal curse, while others saw judgment of the Gods. Those it did not kill swiftly suffered a far worse fate, a wasting illness that ended with transformation into a hideous undead horror. Thais val\u2019Ishi, priestess of Beltine, insisted on traveling to the afflicted land to study the plague. There she dwelled, healing whom she could. Those that she could not heal she slew, for the destruction of the undead was a mercy. It was during these years that she crafted this staff, to aid her both in healing, and in destruction. Thais and her followers were able to stem the tide of the disease, but not before it claimed her life. Her apprentice took up the staff, and showed Thais its final mercy by destroying the creature she became. Abilities/Effects: This magic weapon functions as a staff of healing with the additional ability to cast regeneration (10 charges). Unlike a normal staff of healing, this magic weapon has no risk of being lost forever, nor can it be used to attack a living creature. When attacking undead, you gain a +2 to attack and damage rolls with this magic weapon. When you hit a corporeal undead (such as a zombie) it takes an extra 3d10 radiant damage. Nerothian Assassins Blade Weapon (dagger), uncommon Description: Pitted and badly rusted, this unassuming blade is nonetheless a dangerous and powerful tool. History: After their initial defeats in the Heretic Wars many Milandisians began to talk of surrender. At that moment, however, death struck Ashvan. Children, innocent townsfolk, and even priests of the church were slain by a contagion which healers soon declared to be magical and deliberately inflicted. Passions against the Nerothian disease-bearers raged, and the people of Milandir rallied to battle once again. But it was not Nerothians who had committed the deed. A Priest of Hurrian, seeking to motivate the people, had crafted this dagger to cast blame on the Cancerese. When this was discovered investigators were horrified. The priest was given a swift traitor\u2019s death, and the entire incident was silenced by order of King Andreas II. The dagger itself was stolen by thieves, and the copies eventually created can be purchased on the black market. Abilities/Effects: If you score a critical hit against a creature or deal sneak attack damage to a creature, you may cast contagion (save DC 14, disease option slimy doom) targeting that creature. Once this ability is used it may not be used again until midnight. Nightfire Weapon (mace), legendary (requires attunement) Description: This fluted silver rod is capped at one end with white-silver quartz. The other end of the rod opens out into a concave space with a decorated rim around it. History: Gusta Gloriana\u2019s signature weapon reflects her many adventures in the eighth century. She acquired it as a gift from the Kio after fending off a barbarian horde from Uggur. From there she traveled to the Lhauzyr Mountains and befriended the Tir Betoqi dwarves, who laid the first enchantments upon it. With her allies, she took the long trek through Canceri and in Nishanpur she endeared herself to the Illiirites known as the Confraternity of the Just Death, who further enchanted the mace. Gusta was slain defending pilgrims during the second Coryani- Khitani war, but Nightfire was recovered and remains a weapon of great interest, though Gusta\u2019s own tale is seldom remembered. Abilities/Effects: You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. When you wield this weapon, the concave end fills with a ball of radiant energy that sheds bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. While this light is active, your attacks with this weapon deal radiant damage instead of bludgeoning. Additionally, if you roll a 20 while attacking with this weapon your target must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be stunned until the end of their next turn. Lastly, as an action you may slam this weapon to the ground, creating a wave of radiant energy that causes all creatures in a 30-foot cone to succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or suffer 6d8 radiant damage, suffering half damage on a successful save. Once used, this ability cannot be used again until the next dawn.\u2003 Oathmaker Weapon (dagger), rare (requires attunement by a worshiper of Sarish) Description: The hilt of this blade is made from the bleached bone of a fiend, and covered with the metallic scales of an infernal lord. A devil\u2019s tooth caps the end of the hilt, painted with Sarishan sigils in ichor. The blade itself is Sarishan steel, thin and double-edged. One edge is serrated near the hilt, to cause extra pain. History: An outbreak of unbound infernals unleashed by the Seekers of the Hidden Master took everything from Jamshi Feroze, and merely killing the fiends was not vengeance enough. They needed to suffer. He became a Sarishan who specialized in binding, and once bound he would subject the infernals to cruel tortures with the help of oathmaker. He crafted the blade himself from the body parts of his victims around a blade of Sarishan steel. Jamshi is now an old and frail man, but that has not stopped him from filling his dungeon with the screams of bound infernals. Abilities/Effects: You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magical weapon. As a bonus action, the wielder of this weapon can sense the presence of any infernals or tainted creatures within 30 feet. This effect is blocked by anything that can block the detect evil and good spell. In addition, as an action the wielder can invoke the weapon\u2019s magic to grant themselves protection from infernals. For 1 minute, any infernal or tainted creatures attacking the wielder suffers disadvantage on their attack rolls and the wielder cannot be charmed, frightened or possessed by such creatures. Once used, this ability cannot be used again until the next dawn. Pathfinder Weapon (spear, unique), legendary (requires attunement) Description: The weapon is engraved on the side in Ancient Altharin with the words \u201cSo you may always know your path. \u201d History: After the founding of the Imperium, a number of val\u2019Dellenov struck out into the wilderness to the east. One of these was Zephyra val\u2019Dellenov, daughter of the first val\u2019Dellenov. Legend has it that she changed the course of the Nardau River, drove a great evil out of the Faerdwalden, and first peopled Sylvania with her children. Always in these tales her magical spear Pathfinder is at her side. Zephyra had only to name a thing, and Pathfinder would unerringly point the way. Pathfinder has reappeared many times over the ages, most recently in the hands of Ishild val\u2019Dellenov of Lustia, who was slain in the Heretic Wars. Abilities/Effects: You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. You also gain advantage on all Wisdom (Survival) and Wisdom (Insight) rolls made to find your way in the wilderness or to track a specific quarry.

Once you use this ability, you cannot do so again until the next dawn. Petrus Kafan: \u201cHope\u2019s Dart\u201d Weapon (spear), very rare (requires attunement) Description: This simple ash hafted spear has a remarkably adorned cold iron spearhead, depicting the eternal struggle between the Infernal Lord and the First Emperor. History: At the battle of Hope\u2019s End, the Infernal Horde finally turned and faced the assembled forces of the armies of the First Emperor of Coryan. There, a legendary duel was fought between the forces of the Devil King Uhxbractit and the First Emperor. According to legend, the battle raged for eight days until the First Emperor was struck with a poisoned dart. The base attack was witnessed by young Yolim val\u2019Tensen and vowed that the cowardly attack would not go unanswered. As the mass of humanity rushed down on their Infernal foes in vengeance, Yolim took up his shortspear, called upon the strength of the god Hurrian and let fly. It is said that Hurrian and Sarish looked down upon the young warrior and the treachery that befell Illiir\u2019s chosen and sent Their blessings, with Hurrian strengthening his arm and Sarish blessing the dart. The spear flew over the charging legionnaires and struck true, burying itself in the breast of the foul, fiend that had poisoned the Emperor. There was a blinding flash of light and a howl of pure terror from the creature. As the light cleared, the Infernal was no more; vengeance had been served. Since that time, priests of Hurrian and Sarish worked together to recreate Petrus Kafan, literally \u201cHope\u2019s Dart\u201d in ancient Altharin. Their efforts produced shortspears of amazing powers, which are given to those legions venturing into Canceri or any place where Infernals may be found. Abilities/Effects: You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic spear. When you hit an infernal with this weapon, it takes an extra 2d8 lightning damage. This weapon has 5 charges. You may use your action and expend a charge to force one infernal you can see to make a DC 17 Charisma saving throw. If it fails, the infernal is banished back to its home plane and cannot return to the material plane for a year and a day. Once all 5 charges are spent, this weapon is destroyed.\u2003 Shadowsong Weapon (dagger), very rare (requires attunement) Description: This dagger looks to be made of iron with small reddish imperfections that that can be seen only in candlelight. History: Ivor Kilmek was a Milandisian bard of noble birth who came to Savona to add wine and women to his life of song, but instead found himself caught up in the Savonan dueling culture. Here was a thrill he did not know he had needed, and he threw himself into the dashing world of the swashbuckler, favoring the shortsword and dagger. He raided his family treasury, discovering vials of infernal ichor handed down from an adventuring ancestor. Using the blood, he crafted shadowsong, and with it he won many duels. It is whispered that when a rival finally slew him his soul passed into the dagger, damned by his use of the tainted fluid. Abilities/Effects: You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic dagger. This increases to +2 when you wield it against infernals. When you use a bonus action to attack with this weapon, it deals an additional 3d6 piercing damage. Any time this dagger is thrown as a ranged attack, it immediately flies back to your hand after the attack. Sickle of the Mighty Oak Weapon (sicklej, rare (requires attunement) Description: This sickle is comprised of a silver blade ornamented with oak leaves and acorns with a shaft made from the finest oak. History: The legends of the Legion of the Mighty Oak are too numerous to count, but outsiders rarely hear of the cadre of Saluwean druids who forego their sacred groves to join the legion as a support unit. Dressed in hide and leather instead of lorica, and performing sacred rituals to heal the wounded and cleanse the land after every battle, the powers of these druids have contributed greatly to the success of the legion. In the fourth century Lebuin val\u2019Dellenov, archdruid of the Golden Boughs of Saluwe, acknowledged their sacrifice by commissioning new weapons for the druids who were averse to the traditional gladii. For their leader Lebuin created the sickle of the mighty oak personally, to thank him for his service. The original sickle is still held by the leader of the cadre today. Abilities/Effects: You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. While this weapon held any spell you cast of 1 st level or higher to restore hit points to a creature heals an additional number of hit points equal to your proficiency bonus. Additionally, you may use the sickle to draw a single poison from a willing creature as if you had cast the protection from poison spell. Once used, this second ability cannot be used again until the next dawn. Torment Weapon (dagger, unique), legendary (requires attunement by a val\u2019Inares or worshiper ofAnshar) Description: Torment is an ancient basalt dagger that brings agonizing pain to all that it strikes. Vicious serrations along the blade\u2019s length cause brutal wounds that have difficulty closing. The handle of this blade is wrapped in blood-stained leather; blood drawn by the thorns that pierce the leather and the hand of the wielder. History: Agrippas val\u2019Inares is said to have created this blade during the Shadowed Age. He did not. As he grew older Agrippas felt the calling to enter a portal for an unknown destination, like all val\u2019Inares. He was met on the other side by Ssanu of the Ssethregoran Empire, eager to sacrifice him. One of them wielded Torment, and Agrippas ripped the dagger from the creature\u2019s grip. Immediately he felt a kinship with the blade, and could wield it expertly and escape. The experience addled his mind deeply, and little of what he was able to express to the val\u2019Inares family made sense, but his rantings were written down in scrolls kept secret by the family, and Torment itself became a holy relic of Anshar. Agrippas re-entered a portal three years later, and never returned. Abilities/Effects: You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. If you hit a living creature with this weapon, their hit point maximum is reduced by ld4. All monks and divine spellcasters who venerate Anshar automatically have proficiency with this weapon, and this weapon is considered a monk weapon for worshipers of Anshar.\u2003 Wind Staff Weapon (quarterstaff), very rare (requires attunement) Description: A quarterstaff made from the wood of a white ash tree, decorated with carvings depicting swirling air and a pair of horns on top. History: During the First Crusade of Light, the leader who forged the Coryani Empire found himself pinned with the Corlathian Mountains at his back and besieged on all sides by hordes of infernals. Undaunted, the First Emperor climbed to the summit of Mt. Olmacha, found a white ash tree that grew there, and broke off a branch. Within moments, he had fashioned a staff whose top was curved like ram\u2019s horns. As he crafted the staff, he was observed by a val\u2019Tensen shepherd who hid behind an outcropping of rocks and stared in wonder at the Emperor\u2019s calm demeanor, knowing that an army of infernals stood ready to smash his fledgling legions at nightfall. The shepherd\u2019s reverie was broken by his commanding voice, calling him from his hiding place. \u201cCome to my side, Lenes val\u2019Tensen, and see what I have wrought. \u201d Shaken, the young shepherd approached. The First Emperor held the staff aloft and suddenly the faint winds began to swirl and gather strength, until they roared like a wounded beast. A small whirlwind appeared, unfolding like a fresh bloom. Nestled within, a great air elemental lord appeared and bowed its head. \u201cWhat is thy bidding, co us in ? \u2019\u2019With but a few words, the Emperor made clear his desires. That evening, the infernals were routed by not just the forces of the Coryani legions, but by the might of the Lord of the Howling Winds and his hosts. After the battle, the Emperor called for the val\u2019Tensen shepherd and gave him the staff. Fie spoke of the deadly evil that roamed the lands on the other side of the mountain range and his desire that his people be guarded against these perils. The Emperor tasked the young man with forming a cadre of rangers to patrol the mountains, and whispered in his ear the secret of crafting such a staff so that they could be armed with the power of the winds. Years passed and the infernal hordes became trapped behind the Wall of the Gods. The First Emperor passed on and the fledging alliance of territories grew into the vast Coryani Empire. True to his vow, Lenes val\u2019Tensen gathered men about him and taught them to survive and thrive in the rugged mountainous terrain. When the training of his first group was complete, he called upon the power of the staff to contact the Lord of the Howling Winds and was surprised to see that a lone small elemental of air appeared instead. \u201cYou are not the Lord of the Howling Winds,\u201dLenes gaped in surprise. \u201cYou are not the Emperor,\u201d the elemental replied matter-of-factly. The wind staff is the symbol of the val\u2019Tensen rangers who protect those who travel throughout the Corlathian mountain range. The secret of its creation has been handed down exactly as the First Emperor instructed. An apprentice ranger must craft his own staff, empower it, and attune an air elemental to heed its call. Abilities/Effects: You gain a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. While you are attuned to this item, you gain a fly speed of 30 feet. Summon Air Elemental: As an action you may summon an air elemental of a CR equal to double your proficiency bonus. The elemental appears in an unoccupied space you choose within 120 feet of you. It remains for a maximum of 1 hour, until you use another action to dismiss it, or until it drops to 0 hit points, after which it returns to its elemental plane. While summoned, the elemental is friendly to you and to your companions. It obeys any commands you give it, no matter what language you use. If you fall unconscious or fail to command it, the elemental defends itself and you against attackers but takes no other actions. After the elemental departs, this property cannot be used again until 7 days have passed. Simple RfingGD weapons Seeking Sling Weapon (sling), very rare Description: This plain and unremarkable strip of leather is popular with thieves, and other ne\u2019er-do-wells. These weapons are ideal for use in the confined, crowded spaces such as the busy street markets of Grand Coryan or other large cities. History: Young Bianca Desiderio, unlike many of her peers on the streets of Old Coryan, was determined to make something of herself. She spent what coins she could beg or pickpocket on lessons, studied magical crafting, and eventually became apprenticed to an artificer, but she never\u2003 forgot where she came from. When Big Dario was killed in a turf war, she made the first seeking sling so her old gang could avenge him. Using her creation her friends were able to make names for themselves in the Fellowship of Little Savona, and soon Bianca\u2019s skills were in high demand from Old Coryan\u2019s criminals. Abilities/Effects: You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic sling. Also, while holding this weapon, as a bonus action, you may whisper a name of a creature to the weapon. The creature named does not benefit from cover or being in an obscured area if attacked with this weapon. The precise name is not necessary for this effect, only the creature\u2019s common name (\u2014\u201ca criminal named \u2018Lefty\u2019\u201d). Silent Death Weapon (short bow, unique), legendary (requires attunement by a val\u2019Borda) Description: Silent Death is an ancient composite short bow crafted from the finest polished ebony wood. History: Idesta val\u2019Borda was only fifteen when she fought at the Battle of Hope\u2019s End. When the Second Crusade began, she was an old woman, but her intelligence had not diminished. She saw that Abessios itself was impenetrable, for the Vizier of the Phaeron Kefrin had mastery of the magical spells warding that city. She could no longer enter battle herself, but she strained her powers to the breaking point crafting her finest weapon, Silent Death. When the bow was completed she died, her spirit spent in the summoning of such power. Taking up the bow the val\u2019Borda marched on Abessios. As the Vizier opened his mouth to command his arcane powers the bow was fired, and silence fell upon him. Before he could recover, Twilight Warriors had jumped through shadow and buried their blades in him. The way to Abessios was opened. Abilities/Effects: You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic bow. All arrows fired from this bow create no sound as they pass through the air, and this weapon\u2019s normal range is extended out to its long range of 320 feet. When the arrow strikes a target, a 30-foot bubble of silence surrounds the target for 1 minute. No sound can pass through the bubble and any creature inside the bubble is deafened and immune to thunder damage. Any spell that requires a verbal component cannot be cast inside the bubble. WOnDRQUS Items Amulet of Belisarda\u2019s Fury Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement by an elorii) Description: These amulets appear as simple wooden holy symbols bearing the symbol of Belisarda. History: After the Godswar, the priesthood of Belisarda knew that while their vengeance might be postponed, the elorii homelands must remain defended. These amulets were first forged in Elonbe for that purpose and enhanced the reputation of the Vastwood as being impenetrable to humans. After the Malfelan elorii began using these amulets on their assaults on mankind, the Life Wardens altered these items, requiring an oath, dedicated to Belisarda, to defend the elorii homelands in order to activate the amulet. While this might seem a simple thing, it has nonetheless been effective at dissuading the abuse of these items by elorii who might ignore Ardelia\u2019s prophecy. Abilities/Effects: This amulet has 3 charges and regains ld3 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a roll of 1 the amulet cannot regain charges until submerged in an Orumar for 1 day. While you wear this amulet, you can use an action and expend 1 charge to send yourself into a divinely inspired frenzy. For 1 minute, all your melee weapon attacks and unarmed strikes deal an additional ld4 damage of their usual type and you gain advantage on all Strength checks. While this effect is active you can only use lethal force. You may not use this ability if you have levels of exhaustion Once the duration of the effect has ended, or if you fall unconscious, or if all enemies within 30 feet of you have been killed, you suffer 1 level of exhaustion. Amulet of Illiir\u2019s Perfect Brilliance Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement by a divine spellcaster ofllliir) Description: This amulet that is fashioned from hand-carved alder branches and shaped into a sunburst after weeks of pain-staking work. It is then blessed and consecrated to Illiir. History: When humans arrived on the shores of Onara they faced a dilemma. The amidet of Illiir\u2019s perfect brilliance, worn by the most faithful of the King of the Gods, must be crafted from freshly cut, hale branches of the alder tree. Seeds of the alder tree had been brought to the continent, but the trees that grew from them were subtly changed by the new soil and climate, and were no longer perfect in Illiir\u2019s sight. For a full one thousand years, holy orders of Saluwe tended to sacred groves across the Imperium in the grandest husbandry project known to human history. Finally, with much rejoicing and great celebration, the Priesthood ofllliir pronounced one of their alder trees to be sufficiently perfect to once again craft the amulet. This \u201cperfect\u201d strain of trees has been carefully guarded and cultivated ever since, and only a few branches are allowed to be cut each year by properly consecrated artificers. Abilities/Effects: This amulet may be used as a divine focus. While this amulet is worn, it will emit a faint light equivalent to a candle, shedding bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet. You can activate or suppress this ability at will. This amulet has 3 charges and regains ld3 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a roll of 1 the amulet cannot regain charges until you place it in the light of the sun for a total of 24 hours. While wearing this amulet, you may use an action and expend a charge to cast daylight. Amulet of the Faithful Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement by worshiper of the deity of the amulet) Description: These amulets are simple platinum discs etched with a deity\u2019s holy symbol on the front and a prayer to the deity on the obverse. History: The first records of these amulets stretch back to the early days of the Imperium of Man. According to records, the priesthood and those mages among the faithful worked together to mass produce these amulets as tokens for the clerisy. Alas, since the fall of the Imperium such production is impossible, and these amulets have become both rarer and more valuable. Some examples have been found among the elorii, which are officially explained as the elorii corrupting human symbols of devotion. Fiowever, a few obscure\u2003 reports from the Emerald Society claim to have found similar items written in Ssethric, stretching back to the Empire of Yahssremore, suggesting that perhaps it was the humans who learned the art of these amulets from the elorii instead. These reports are controversial and are dismissed by most scholars. Abilities/Effects: These amulets are inscribed with the holy symbol of a single specific deity. If you worship the god whose symbol is on the amulet, you may use the amulet as a divine focus. Also, any time you use the Channel Divinity feature you gain 1d10 temporary hit points for 1 hour. Amulet of Vigilance Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement) Description: Crafted from jade and carved to appear as a holy symbol of Kassegore (a serpent devouring its own tail), this armlet will increase or decrease in size to fit any wearer\u2019s bicep. History: At the height of the Ssethregoran Empire these armlets were crafted by the Priesthood of Kassegore to protect their troops from the many enslaved and oppressed beings who sought to revolt against their reptilian masters. These items have become increasingly rare in modern times, mainly because elorii will destroy them wherever they find them, and wearing the symbol of Kassegore in the Ssethregoran Empire is considered blasphemy since the coming of the Varn. All attempts to alter the appearance of these armlets by the Ssethregorans have failed, which some see as a sign that the items are inherently blasphemous. Abilities/Effects: While wearing this amulet you have a +5 bonus to your passive Perception and advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks. If you are surprised while wearing this amulet, you can call upon its power to act normally during your first turn. Once used, this ability cannot be used again until the next dawn. Anklet of the Harlot Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement) Description: This beautiful, finely wrought, golden chain is studded with blood-red rubies and sparkling diamonds. Designed to be worn about the ankle, it is often seen in the possession of wealthy women across the Known Lands. History: This item was created by a besotted mage for his Larissan priestess and the sisters of her \u201ctemple\u201d. What followed was a series of robberies and bloody murders in every major city of the Coryani Empire and into the Kingdom of Milandir. The crime spree ended abruptly in the city of Tralia, when the entire coterie was found strangled in a local brothel. Though the assassins were never identified, many believe it was the Troupe of the Final Note, posing as the entertainment in the brothel. Abilities/Effects: While this anklet is worn you are immune to the poisoned condition. Additionally, as an action you may cast sleep (save DC 12). Once used, this ability cannot be used again until the next dawn. Apron of the Artificer Wondrous item, rare Description: This blackened and fire-scarred leather apron contains numerous tiny pockets. When worn by an artificer, this apron grants access to a number of different tool-kits, all readily available at hand. History: The dwarven master-smith Tergaunt of Solanos Mor is remembered both for his skill and as a cautionary tale. Like many of his brethren, he was dedicated to crafting the perfect item in order to free his enclave, yet he found the inefficiency of the crafting process intolerable. He turned his prodigious skill toward time-saving devices. One of his greatest successes was the creation of the apron of the artificer, thus saving precious minutes by avoiding having to search for the right tool in a cluttered smithy. Ironically, Tergaunt\u2019s obsession with creating time-saving magic items consumed him, and he died without ever attempting to craft the perfect item. Abilities/Effects: While this apron is worn you may take an action to reach into any of the apron\u2019s many pockets and produce a tiny set of mundane tools, which grow to full size once placed upon the ground. You may only produce one set of tools at a time, any previously drawn tools vanish into mist. Tools drawn from the apron of the artificer remain in existence until the next dawn. Armbands of Blade Turning Wondrous item, rare Description: Worn high on the arms, these bracers temporarily protect their wearer from blows. Made from board hide, they are lined with linen or silk and are edged with iron bands, sewn on with catgut. History: These armbands are a recent creation, dating from the withdrawal of the Coryani empire from the Hinterlands. The Yhing hir realized they needed better tools to expand\u2003 and thrive in a region suddenly empty of the legions, and their Nawals overcame their suspicion and rivalry to command their greatest crafters to work together to create such tools. Several magical items were created, but one of the most renowned and most sought-after by the horsemen of the Yhing hir were armbands of blade turning, which best suited the lightly-armored and highly-mobile horsemen. Abilities/Effects: These armbands possess 3 charges. While worn, as a reaction to being struck by a melee attack, you can expend 1 charge to gain resistance to slashing damage, including damage from the triggering attack, until the end of your next turn.

The tactic known as the \u2018steel storm\u2019, so called because of the thunder of the horses\u2019 hooves and the clouds of dust raised, was originally developed by the val\u2019Tensen using mounts wearing this armor strategically placed throughout the line.

History: During the Imperium of Man a great theological debate raged between Beltinians and Nerothians over the virtues of Neroth\u2019s gift. The Beltinians believed the gift should only be tolerated when spontaneously granted by Neroth, if at all. The Nerothians, on the other hand, believed the gift should be deliberately spread to the worthy. While the debate raged the Beltinian priesthood took matters into their own hands, crafting these pins to protect themselves from rogue Nerothian necromancers, whom they warned preyed upon the newly deceased faithful and destroyed their soul. A panic began, and those wealthy enough gladly donated to the Beltinian temple to receive a pin and protect themselves from the Nerothians.

Seeking to deal with this threat internally before the Inquisition became involved, the Ansharans dispatched their holy champions, the Bearers of Woe. What the Bearers of Woe found in the sect\u2019s monastery has never been revealed, but the sect ceased to exist, and the Bearers of Woe emerged with the first blood robes.

The Yhing hir prize their mounts above all things and believe firmly that a man without a horse is no man. Fearing that his inability to ride competently would doom him to a life of servitude, his mother begged an Ehtzara to help her boy. The night before his right of passage, the mystic gave his mother a magical bridle and by mid\u00acafternoon, Alwan was inducted into the tribe as an adult.

He found that the most respected duelists disparaged him; no one would rely on such a crutch rather than skill alone. Still, his boots were very popular among those who cared more about results than etiquette, and Ciro val\u2019Sheem died a wealthy man, even if he never had the respect he desired.

Reports vary in some details, but all agree that Deveros is said to have kicked in the sealed, barred and bolted gates to the city before cowing the leaders of the insurgency. When Deveros perished in a Voei ambush, his boots were lost with him. Since then, the boots have surfaced occasionally, before finally falling into the hands of Vespoltoc, a Tultipetan craftsman. Vespoltoc managed to determine that these boots were created in the lost dwarven enclave of Corett Palas, famed for creating exquisite and unique magical garments.

History: During the Imperium of Man, the secrets of these boxes were tightly held by the Pantheonistic Church, which used them to disenchant items that they considered cursed, heretical, or just too dangerous to be allowed to exist. With the fall of the First Imperium, however, these boxes and the secrets of their manufacture spread to become the bane of mages everywhere. While these items are not illegal to own, their use is widely despised by magical craftsmen across Onara. The Sorcerer King sees the very existence of these boxes as an affront to his magical power. He has instructed his minions to harvest anyone they discover with such a box, regardless of their magical ability.

The Naori chieftain claimed that their god, a being that lives in the active volcano in the center of the island, empowered the bracers to protect the natives from the raiders that came from the \u201cblack ships made of stone\u201d. While the Naori consider the bracers to be a gift from their god, these mysterious raiders had not landed on their shores since before the chieftain\u2019s grandfather\u2019s time.

History: During the Shadow Age, the lands that now comprise the war-torn lands of Almeric were crushed beneath the tyrannical heel of the Auxunite warlords. Resistance towards these oppressive tyrants created strange bedfellows. On such instance was the dear friendship struck between the Solani dwarf Entalwen and a monk by the name of Aidic val\u2019Tensen. Aidic belonged to a pacifistic order that refused to involve themselves in the rebellion, but the young monk could not stand idly by while his fellow man suffered. Entalwen crafted a magnificent set of golden bracers inscribed with the glyphs and symbols of the Storm Lord, Hurrian to aid him in his battles. Unfortunately, the bracers of the thunderer were not enough to save Aidic from the wrath of the mighty Warlord Khidath, who left the monk\u2019s broken body draped over the central gates of Nevanne as a warning to those contemplating further insurrection. In the dead of night, Entalwen snuck into the city and retrieved his friend\u2019s shattered corpse.

Eventually, a coalition of dwarves from Solanos Mor, the val\u2019Tensen family and the human populace of the region overthrew the occupying forces of the Auxunite Empire. Aidic\u2019s death galvanized the monks of the Iron Wind to action; they lead the rebellion against their oppressors at the cost of their lives. With their death, the Monastery of the Iron Wind faded from memory and with them vanished the bracers of the thunderer. Emerald Society scholars believe that the bracers are hidden away in some as yet undiscovered Auxunite treasure trove or within the lost monastery of the Iron Wind.

Filharra was mortified by her family\u2019s meddling, refused any commission until she had earned it, and turned the cape over to the Sky Knights.

To this end, they crafted collars that allowed their male slaves to bond more closely to their \u201cpack\u201d. While this sect was never large and was swiftly suppressed by the appalled val\u2019Dellenov matriarchy, the collars themselves were recognized as useful.

History: When the priesthood of Larissa first changed to embrace Her aspect of forbidden pleasure, there was much debate among the clergy. Even among those who embraced aspect, some thought it should be curtailed or tempered with her oracular aspect. Many of the younger followers of Larissa saw this as the doddering conservatism of old age, and they first created cosmetics of comeliness as a symbol of rebellion against the oracular establishment, as well as their embrace of Larissa\u2019s debauchery without reservation. As time went on this symbolic meaning of the cosmetics faded, and now these magical items are even carried by priestesses of the oracular school, albeit not frequently. Abilities/Effects: Each box of these cosmetics possesses 3 applications. Using an application takes 1 minute and allows you to cast disguise self (save DC 15).

History: During the Shadowed Age, Licinius Dovitoni led a group of bandits that terrorized the eastern coast of what is now the province of Cafela. Though the merchants and government officials offered hefty rewards for his capture, he became a folk hero to the people of Sulpecci, as he shared his ill- gotten wealth with the impoverished and oppressed. He was particularly popular with the itinerant priestesses of Larissa in the town, his good looks and charm making him welcome in Sulpecci\u2019s many brothels. During one of his robberies, Licinius attacked a procession of travelers and inadvertently killed one of the passengers. The victim was the High Priestess of Larissa, traveling from Savona to the outlying towns and settlements in the region. With her last breath, she cursed Licinius, forever depriving him of the Goddess of Luck and Beauty\u2019s favor. Instantly, the handsome young raider\u2019s body became twisted, with boils and seeping ulcers covering him. He fled wailing, knowing that his life enjoying the pleasures of the world were now denied to him. The years of living the life of a hermit slowly drove Licinius mad. In his lunacy, he wrote prayers in supplication to the Divine Harlot, pleading for Her forgiveness on small placards with strange figures on their reverse.

Others were found scattered across the cave and they were quickly collected and divided among the group.

Demonhide Cloak Wondrous item, legendary (requires attunement) Description: This crude cloak, repulsive to most people, is created from the uncured hide of an infernal. These cloaks vary as much in appearance as the creatures they are crafted from, but the one thing that remains constant is the general aura of malaise that surrounds them. History: The first demon hide cloak was created during the First Crusade of Light as trophies. The priesthood looked askance at wearing the skins of such abominable creatures, but it was not until over a century later, when the Inquisition found themselves with more power, that the Mother Church declared these items blasphemous and ordered them destroyed on sight. What was a symbol of opposition against infernals became a symbol of devotion, and the Seekers of the Hidden Master sought to save as many demonhide cloaks as they could from the Inquisition\u2019s cleansing flames. With the opening of the Sealed Lands, some infernal hunters have taken to crafting these items as trophies once again, as priests are reluctant to criticize the brave defenders at the Wall of the Gods.

Once used, this ability cannot be used again until the next dawn. Devilskin Knot Wondrous item, legendary (requires attunement) Description: A devilskin knot appears to be a fist sized knot of tightly wrapped strips of black leather. Upon closer examination, the strips of leather are rough and pebbly, and seem to constantly strain against their current configuration. In actuality, the knot is created by flaying strips of skin from a captive barbed devil. As the final step of creating the knot, the barbed devil is imprisoned inside the item. The knot constantly writhes and struggles to undo itself as the infernal inside it seeks release. History: Not all the clergy of Sarish wish to drive the infernals from Arcanis. There are numerous practitioners of magic, including many of Sarish\u2019s worshippers, who take unholy glee from binding infernals to their will. The worst of these individuals, known as the Seekers of the Hidden Master, are located in the dark bowels of Canceri, where their twisted pacts with the infernals are smiled upon and encouraged. This secret society wishes to defy the will of the gods, and bring back the Devil- Kings of old, reinstating their rule over mankind as it was during the Time of Terror. Abilities/Effects: When this item is hurled at a creature the knot explodes into a flurry of tentacles, restraining the creature and sapping its life force. As an action, you can throw the knot at a creature within 30 feet of you. That target must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or become restrained as the knot wraps securely around it. As an action on its turn, a restrained creature may attempt to escape the knot by making a DC 15 Strength or Dexterity saving throw (affected creature\u2019s choice). On a successful saving throw, they escape the knot. If the target succeeds on their initial saving throw or later escapes the knot, it returns to you immediately, dropping next to you if you cannot grasp it. Once the knot is restraining a creature, as an action you can force the restrained creature to succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or suffer 2d10 points of necrotic damage. The restrained creature suffers 1 level of exhaustion for every 20 points of damage inflicted by the knot. If the restrained creature dies while affected by the knot, the knot immediately returns to your side. Whenever the knot deals damage to a creature, roll a d20. On a roll of 1 the barbed devil trapped within breaks free, destroying the knot. This barbed devil is an unbound infernal and is not under your control; it will attack you if n can. The knot has an AC of 20 and 20 hit points. It regenerates 1 hit point every 5 minutes if it has at least 1 hit point. If the knot is ever reduced to 0 hit points, it is destroyed. Roll a d8. On a roll of 1 the barbed devil is released as above.

History: Karaz val\u2019Abebi was one of the greatest Altherian artisans ever known, and a member of the very Council of Wisdom that petitioned Althares for his First Gift. While his most famous works included the magnificent floating city of Khafre, he was a tireless craftsman who created many of what he called \u201cbaubles\u201d, which to any other artisan would be masterworks. One of these was the diadem of mental clarity. While the diadem was not as great a creation as Khafre, it was perhaps more significant. Several diadems were sold to others, and it was those wearing these diadems that saw through the network of illusions protecting Khafre during its construction and hastened its end. Abilities/Effects: This diadem has 3 charge and regains ld3 charges daily at dawn. If you expend the diadem\u2019s last charge, roll a d20. On a roll of 1, diadem crumbles to dust. .

History: These doorknobs were first created by Dimitri Fealgren, a gnomish devotee of Cadic. Dimitri used the doorknob for several years to both steal money and food from the rich. Eventually, he perished when he carried a stolen bag of holding through the passage he created and was scattered across the Astral Plane. Abilities/Effects: As an action, you can place this doorknob on any non-magical wall. Once affixed, a standard sized door appears in the wall and can be opened as if it was a normal door. Once you walk through it, the door can be closed and the doorknob removed the other side, causing the door to disappear. If the wall is greater than 10 feet thick, opening the door reveals a 5 foot by 10-foot alcove or closet. Once you enter the alcove, the doorknob can be removed as normal, but the space created remains and can be hidden in. The alcove holds enough air for one Medium creature to survive for 1 hour. If an item containing an extra-dimensional space is brought through a passage created by the doorknob, a rift to the Astral Plane is created and the offending item, its contents and the contents of the passageway are scattered onto that plane. If the doorknob itself is placed into an extra-dimensional space, a rift to the Shadow Plane is created and the space, its contents, the doorknob and everything within 10 feet of the doorknob are sucked through into the Shadow Plane. Dolphin Tabard Wondrous item, rare Description: These tabards are embroidered with images of dolphins and decorated with gold trim. History: In the first centuries of the Coryani Empire many magical items were created for the Coryani legions, but General Maeda val\u2019Ossan found that few of these items served the marine tactics of her Legion of Naeraanth. With the outbreak of the Children\u2019s Crusade she was finally able to convince Empress Shar val\u2019Assante that new magical items were needed for her legionnaires. To assist the Legion of Naeraanth in its sea battles against the Black Fleet, the first Dolphin Tabards were created, bearing the symbol of the legion\u2019s dolphin standard.

Each bell weighs over 500 lbs. and must be properly balanced and mounted on its wooden stand. History: As the Canceri insurrection against the Coryani Empire spread south, Milandisian legions stood against them in the Blighted Mire. In what the Dark Triumvirate regards as a miracle, a Nerothian priestess named Mohana val\u2019Mordane and her outnumbered Cancerese rebels stumbled upon a vein of meteoric ore in that swamp. Struck by a vision from Neroth, the priestess commanded her fellows to mine the ore, from which she crafted the first crude doom bell, which slew many of the Milandisians and forced the rest into retreat. To this day doom bells protect many Dark Triumvirate churches, and all are crafted from the ore found only in the Blighted Mire. It is illegal in Canceri for anyone outside the Church of the Dark Triumvirate to possess any of this precious ore. Abilities/Effects: This bell and its stand are a Large object and in order to attune the bell to a building you must place it on the roof of the building or in a bell-tower.

When the stopper, which is the cat\u2019s head, is removed, a handful of dust streams into the air, creating mirages to confound the user\u2019s foes. History: Despite its modern origins, scholars debate who created the dust of mirages. Some claim the cat shape of the phylactery that holds the dust points to a Sarishan origin, while some suggest the Troupe of the Final Note or even the elorii. One thing they are quite certain of is that the gnomish mage Reatho Gromajj could not be the creator as he claims. Granted, he does always seem to have a ready supply of the stuff, and no one can remember the dust being available before Reatho began selling it, but most val and humans simply refuse to accept that a gnome could have created something so useful. Abilities/Effects: Each bottle of dust of mirages contains enough dust for 5 uses. As an action, you, can scatter a use of dust into the air to cast mirage arcane. After you have used the last of the dust, the bottle loses all magical properties. Dust of Size Alteration Wondrous item, rare Description: A plain leather pouch contains this dust. At first glance, this dust appears to be a dull grey, but upon closer inspection each grain of the dust randomly shifts in color between white and black. History: Tradition attributes the creation of this useful magical dust to Cadic himself. According to legend, while Cadic was attempting to woo Larissa he feared that her distaste for him would lead to rejection regardless of his music. Thus, he hid himself and began to play his enchanting song, but when she searched for the musician he used the dust of shrinking and enlargement to become small and sneaked away. After three nights of this Larissa\u2003 was so entranced by his music, and so longed to meet the musician, that Cadic revealed himself and his wooing of Her began in earnest. Abilities/Effects: Each pouch of this dust contains enough for 5 uses. As an action, you can sprinkle a use on a creature to cast enlarge/reduce (save DC 13) on it. After you have used the last of the dust, the pouch loses all magical properties. Dust of Warding Wondrous item, very rare Description: This slender ebony tube, carved to appear as a stretching demon, holds a single dose of this rare and powerful dust. History: This dust is rumored to have been created by the Order of the Emerald Flame under the personal direction of the Sorcerer King during the Time of Terror. Use of this dust provided wards against the infernals that conquered the mainland, leaving Ymandragore free of the fell creatures that the Sorcerer-King\u2019s own actions had unleashed. Regardless of the truth to that rumor, this dust is most commonly found in the employ of Ymandrakes. Recently, members of the Sanctorum of the Arcane managed to steal the secrets of dust of warding from Ymandrakes operating on the Pirate Isles. Since that time the Sanctorum of the Arcane has been able to create a small amount of this rare powder. Abilities/Effects: Each pouch of this dust contains enough for 1 use. As an action, you can pour this dust on an area or object and cast the antipathy spell (save DC 23) on it. This action takes 1 hour.

Sweet Savona, so called for the ever-present scent of incense, is renowned for its festivals and dedications to Larissa, Goddess of Passion. Indeed, merchants, nobles, and peasants alike flock to the City of Joy to partake of its delights, pleasures and sins. Like all cities, Savona does have a business side. With so many visitors from across the Known Lands passing through its gates every day, it\u2019s na\u00efve to think the city is all pleasure and no work. Business deals are transacted in darkened warehouses or across tables in smoky tavernas. Because there is such high merchant traffic through the city, a few enterprising artificers began crafting small baubles to aid in these dealings. Abilities/Effects: While this earring is worn you gain advantage on all Wisdom (Perception) checks dependent upon hearing.

Eelskin Cloak Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement) Description: Each cloak is fashioned from vertical strips of eel hide and lined with oiled sheep-skin for a modicum of comfort. Unfortunately, there is no way to disguise the rancid fish smell that lingers around the cloak. It is easy to spot someone wearing one of these cloaks, due to the conspicuous open space that surrounds them in crowds, rather than because of the cloak\u2019s unusual silver color. History: The precise origins of these cloaks are shrouded in mystery. They almost certainly originated with the Undir of the Western Lands, though where they got them none can say. Some scholars believe they were given these items as a gift by the elorii of Entaris, while others point to their legendary undine ancestors. Regardless, despite their smell, these cloaks are highly prized among Undir fishermen. Indeed, some Undir fishermen wear non-magical eelskin cloaks as a sign of their dedication to their craft.

Eloisa\u2019s Dancing Shoes Wondrous item, very rare Description: These black veldt shoes have a pair of green silk straps that tie up to the knee. History: Prince Rogan of Milandir, great-uncle to King Osric II, was known as a womanizer and a scoundrel. Despite his reputation, Rogan was at least careful to keep his trysts and sordid affairs out of the court, so as to not embarrass the other members of the Royal Family. However, one of these affairs became rather conspicuous. A young courtesan from Savona, Eloisa Gevane, caught Rogan\u2019s eye. The two began to meet secretly late at night as a playful tryst, but eventually fell in love. Unwilling to keep their romance a secret any longer, Rogan invited Eloisa to a ball as his partner and gave her a pair of wonderful dancing shoes made of the finest veldt and green silk. The reaction of the court was swift and unmerciful. Amidst shouts of outrage and derision, he and Eloisa were forced to leave the ball, shamed and humiliated. Abilities/Effects: While wearing these shoes you have a +1 bonus to you AC, advantage on all Dexterity (Acrobatics) checks, and advantage on Charisma (Performance) checks made while dancing. Everburning Coal Wondrous item, uncommon Description: This lump of coal glows red-hot without ever extinguishing or being consumed and is usually found in a tin censer. History: The first everburning coals were created by the Nierites during the Theocracy of the Cleansing Flame. To possess and carry one of these coals showed devotion to Nier and to the Theocracy. Conversely, those not possessing the coals were viewed with suspicion. After the fall of the Sword of the Heavens these items were treated with disgust, but soon enough their general usefulness won out. While some Nierites still carry these coals as signs of devotion, for the most part they are prized for purely utilitarian reasons, particularly among those who travel in the wilderness. It is rare to find a legion without at least a half-dozen of these items on hand to assist in rapid preparation of meals while on the move. Abilities/Effects: The lump of coal is carried in a small tin censer, and comes with a pair of small tongs sized to handle the lump. If the coal is handled with bare hands it deals ld6 fire damage. The coal sheds bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet and can be used to start fires. Eyepatch of the Corsair Description: This eyepatch is an oval piece of black leather secured to the wearer\u2019s face by long black thong. In the center of the patch are red glyphs that glow menacingly. History: The infamous Armind One-Eye sailed the Pale Sea in his ship the Corruptor for over two decades. Launching out of the city of Freeport, Armind plied his trade, cutting a bloody swath through merchant fleets and dragging the wretched prisoners to Garundi to sell for slaves. Armind\u2019s fierce countenance, scars crisscrossing his face and a ruined left eye, struck fear in the hearts of his enemies. In return for services rendered, Ymandrake artificers crafted an eyepatch to compensate for his loss. This patch and his bloodthirsty reputation as scourge of the seaways earned Armind his nickname \u201cOne- Eye\u201d. Abilities/Effects: You must wear this eye patch over an empty eye-socket to gain any of its benefits or use any of its effects. While this eyepatch is worn, you gain advantage to Dexterity (Acrobatics) and Wisdom (Survival) checks while sailing. As an action, you may cast fear (save DC 16). Once you use this ability, it cannot be used again until the next I 111. linglll. Eyes of Arcane Sight Wondrous item, very rare Description: These dark tinted lenses, set in an ivory frame, are said to have been created by Nurion val\u2019Assante.\u2003 History: The legendary Nurion val\u2019Assante created these lenses sometime after he had established the Sanctorum of the Arcane. Sanctums were often marked with arcane sigils only visible to those with the magical gift, as a precaution against the Harvesters. Unfortunately, this made it very difficult on Nurion\u2019s non-mage allies in the Coryani Senate, whose funding and support were desperately needed. To solve this problem, Nurion created these lenses. Nurion hoped his creation would bring about a closer understanding and kinship between mages and non-mages. In actuality, these items are most sought after by senators and other rich citizens to give to their bodyguards, to protect them from magical attack. Thus, they are often another sign of fear and suspicion against mages. Abilities/Effects: These lenses have 3 charges. While worn over the eyes, as an action you can expend 1 charge to cast one of the following spells, using your spell save DC detect magic, see invisibility, arcane sight. These lenses regain 1d3 charges daily at dawn. See Chapter Nine for the new spell, arcane sight. Fan of the Courtesan Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement) Description: Painted silk and stretched over a silver frame, this lustrous fan is in great demand in Sweet Savona. History: Originally crafted by the 5 th century Imperial Arcanist Ipicon, this fan was a gift to the legendary Savonan courtesan Sashastra. The truth of Sashastra\u2019s life is hidden behind a maze of rumors, half-truths and outright lies, but the greatest mystery remains her death. Any of her many lovers could have murdered the alluring courtesan, but many believe she was murdered by either His Holy Patriarch Cartalla or Emperor Lucian val Assante with the very fan that made her famous. Abilities/Effects: While this fan is held open before your face, you have advantage on Wisdom (Insight) and Charisma (Deception) checks. This fan has 3 charges and regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the fan\u2019s last charge, roll a d20. On a roll of 1, the fan loses all magical properties and crumbles to dust. You may use your action to expend 1 charge to cast one of the following spells, using your spell save DC: charm person, disguise self, or suggestion. Fan of Voice Throwing Wondrous item, uncommon Description: These paper and wooden fans, usually undecorated, are a commonlyemployed by many traveling performers. History: In the back-country of Onara, troupes of gnomish nomads often put on traveling shows for needed coin. They cannot perform in the big cities, where they are generally driven out of everywhere but the worst slums, but in the country they can sometimes find a sympathetic audience. Even here, though, it is not uncommon for a group of humans to turn hostile. In such situations, the gnomes will turn to trickery, and one of the tricks in their arsenal is the fan of voice throwing. Many gnomish troupe leaders carry such a fan, and are adept at throwing the right phrase to the right place in order to distract an angry mob long enough to pack up the wagons and escape. Tales of how these fans were first created are as varied and colorful as the gnomish performers themselves. Abilities/Effects: This fan has 6 charges and regains 1d4+1 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the fan\u2019s last charge, roll a d20. On a roll of 1 this fan loses all magical properties and crumbles to dust. When this fan is held open in front of your lips, as a bonus action you may expend 1 charge to throw your voice to a location within 30 feet of you that you can see. Anyone who can hear your voice may attempt a Wisdom saving throw (DC 18) to recognize that the voice originates from you and not from where you threw it to.\u2003 Figurines of Wondrous Power Wondrous item, rarity by figurine Description: Each of these figurines is a statuette of a creature, small enough to fit in a pocket. Abilities/Effects: If you use an action to speak the command word and throw a figurine to a point on the ground within 60 feet of you, the figurine becomes a living creature. If the space where the creature would appear is occupied by other creatures or objects, or if there isn\u2019t enough space for the creature, the figurine doesn\u2019t become a creature. The creature is friendly to you and your companions. It understands your languages and obeys your spoken commands. If you issue no commands, the creature defends itself but takes no other actions. The creature exists for a duration specific to each figurine. At the end of the duration, the creature reverts to its figurine form. It also reverts to its figurine form if it drops to 0 hit points or if you use an action to speak the command word again while touching it. When the creature becomes a figurine again, its ability to become a creature can\u2019t be used again until a certain amount of time has passed, as specified in the figurine\u2019s description. Adamantine Ants (rare): These ants come in a small steel case which holds twelve half-inch long figurines. They can become giant ants that are each able to lift 35 pounds for 4 hours. You must activate all the ants of the set at once. Once used, these figurines cannot be used again until 2 days have passed. Adamantine Spider (very rare):) Originally the work of the Vyhrnil family of Capharra, this tiny figurine is in the shape of a spider with eight sapphires for eyes. It can turn into a giant spider for 4 hours. In addition to its other stats, this spider can make a single 10-foot by 10-foot waterproof shelter per day out of spider silk. Making this shelter takes 1 hour. Once activated this figurine may not be called upon again until 7 days have passed. Bone Leviathan (very rare): This item is carved from the baleen of a whale. When placed in a body of salt water at least 1 mile across, it can be activated to become a baleen whale for 24 hours. This whale can carry up to 6 medium sized creatures across the water. You cannot control this whale, and it will not necessarily take the most direct route across the water but will not dive if it has creatures on its back. Once it has been used, it cannot be used again until 2 days have passed. Whale Huge beast, unaligned Armor Class 12 (natural armor) Hit Points 76 (8d12 + 24) Speed 40 swim STR DEX CON INT WIS CHA 22 (+6) 12 (+1) 16 (+3) 2 (-4) 11 (+\u00b0) 6 (-2) Senses passive Perception 10 Languages \u2014 Challenge 4 (1,100 XP) ACTIONS Bite: Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., Hit: 22 (3d10 + 6) bludgeoning damage. Brass Monkey (very rare): This figurine is a one- inch tall statuette of an ape, sitting on its haunches with its hands resting upon its knees. Carved entirely from brass, the figure is remarkably detailed although a veneer of corrosion mars its otherwise perfect surface. When activated, the figurine becomes an ape that can understand any language known by the owner as if it had an Intelligence score of 10 for up to 4 hours. Once activated this figurine may not be called upon again until 7 days have passed. Emerald Hedgehog (uncommon): First created by the pilgrim Virega val\u2019Abebi during his travels in the Blessed Lands, this small item is carved from an emerald the size of a normal hedgehog. Each spine is individually carved and small black pearls are inlayed as its eyes. The figurine can become a hedgehog for up to 4 hours. You can command the hedgehog mentally and it has 3 charges. As an action, the hedgehog can expend 1 charge to release its quills in a 5-foot square. This 5-foot square is now considered to be filled with caltrops. Once activated this figurine may not be called upon again until 1 day has passed, and recovers all used charges daily at dawn.

It can become a giant scorpion for up to 4 hours. Once activated this figurine may not be called upon again until 7 days have passed. Obsidian Monkey (very rare):: Believed to originate from somewhere far to the south, these obsidian figurines were brought to the Known Lands by a crazed gnome who babbled incoherently about gigantic maze with people trapped and living therein. This figurine can turn into a baboon for 4 hours. The baboon has advantage on all Dexterity (Stealth) checks, and animates with a dagger that it somehow has proficiency with. Once activated this figurine may not be called upon again until 4 days have passed.

Once activated this figurine may not be called upon again until 2 days have passed. Fins of Yarris Wondrous item, very rare Description: These oddly shaped slippers flatten and widen towards the toes to a width of about six inches. They appear to be made from a very tough grayish leather of some unknown sea mammal. They smell of brine, and if someone puts their ear to the opening, they hear the sounds of waves. History: Officially these slippers were first created by the priesthood of Yarris within the Mother Church sometime during the Imperium of Man, and the scholars agree. Yet there are rumors. Rumors that these slippers were not created under the auspices of the Mother Church. Rumors that they predate the Imperium. Rumors that they were first crafted by humans who dwelled on Onara before the Pantheon of Man arrived, and yet nonetheless still worshiped Yarris. Rumors that those who frequently wear these slippers often simply dive into the waters off the coast of Salantis, and are never seen again. Strangely enough the few scholars who have ever given credence to these rumors have either immediately retracted their statements, or have been found to be heretics and liars, and swiftly silenced. Abilities/Effects: When worn and submerged in water, these shoes become flippers, giving you a swim speed of 60 feet. Additionally, you grow a set of gills allowing you to breathe underwater and you can see through water as if it were normal air. Lastly, you can speak with any aquatic creature as if you had cast speak with animals. Fire Beads Wondrous item, rare Description: Appearing as a common, unpolished bloodstone, this small scarlet sphere is warm to the touch. History: The first fire beads were created by the Order of the Emerald Flame for the Sorcerer King, and were used by Ymandragore during the Children\u2019s Crusade. The ability of even the most mundane Ymandrake troops to create explosions went a long way toward their initial victories in that war. As the tide turned, however, many fire beads were recovered by the Coryani. Once the principle behind them was understood, Coryani mages began creating them as well. Today they are found throughout Onara. Abilities/Effects: When thrown against a solid surface within 30 feet, these beads explode, forcing all creatures within 10 feet to make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 5d10 fire damage and falls prone, or half as much damage on a successful one. Fire Gloves Wondrous item, rare Description: These thick gloves are made from smoky-grey colored leather and are emblazoned with a fine tracery that mimics flames. History: Fire gloves were first created by Victus Publius, a Coryani battlemage, secret Nierite, and member of the Order of the Hidden Flame. For some generations, only a few pairs offire gloves existed, and only exclusively within the Order of the Hidden Flame. Then, after the re-integration of worship of Nier into the Mother Church by Emperor Calcestus val\u2019Assante, many \u201cworshipers of Nier in the Coryani Empire became public. In gratitude, they gifted the Emperor with five pairs offire gloves. The Emperor gave three as gifts to favored servants, but he had his artificers study the other two. Since that time, these items have slowly been becoming available throughout the Coryani Empire and beyond. To wear them is considered a badge of honor by Coryani Nierites. Abilities/Effects: These gloves have 3 charges and regain 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the gloves\u2019 last charge, roll a d20. On a roll of 1 the gloves lose all magical properties and crumble to dust. While wearing these gloves, you can expend 1 charge as an action to cast one of the following spells, using Charisma as your spellcasting ability: burning hands, scorching ray, Nier\u2019s blade. See Chapter Nine for the new spell Nier\u2019s Blade. Flagon of Conviviality Wondrous item, rare Description: A large metal carafe, engraved with depictions of the peace ceremony it was meant to commemorate. History: The first of these flagons was crafted in Solanos Mor to commemorate the one-hundredth anniversary of peace between the Solani and Encali dwarves. Since that time, replicas of the original have become a common gift of truce between nations and different factions. Many of these items can now be found amongst lost treasure hordes, sacked ruins and other forgotten places, as the flagons have survived the alliances they were crafted to commemorate. Abilities/Effects: If you serve wine from this flagon, all creatures within 30 feet must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or have their attitudes adjusted one step towards friendly. This effect lasts for 1 hour, upon which time the creature\u2019s attitude returns to its previous state. Flask of Verdant Glory Wondrous item, uncommon Description: This simple ceramic flask, engraved on one side with the holy symbol of Saluwe. History: In the fourth century Quintina val\u2019Dellenov, a priestess of Saluwe, disappeared in the Golden Boughs of Saluwe. She emerged from the forest\u2019s edgi months later, entirely mad. She carried with her the first flask of verdant glory. The details of her ravings remain a closely kept secret of the val\u2019Dellenov family, but her madness was declared to be holy, and the potion she carried with her was deemed to be a gift from Saluwe herself. Since that time flasks of the green elixir with its faint smells of mistletoe and honey have become so common that most priestesses of Saluwe carry them. Abilities/Effects: As an action, you can fill this flask with fresh, clean water or a vial of holy water. After filling the flask, you can drink it as an action to regain 2dl0 hit points. Once this ability is used, you cannot use it again until the next dawn. Garment of the Hidden Gift Wondrous item, rare Description: See below. History: For centuries the vile Harvesters of Ymandragore have hunted and collected people from the Known Lands who were born with the gift for arcane magic. The Sanctorum of the Arcane was founded to protect those so gifted, so that they might gather and train in safety with their peers. Still, the Harvesters have many means of detecting these arcane manipulators, and a mage outside the shelter of a Sanctorum can fall prey to their traps. As a further precaution, the Sanctorum developed the garment of the hidden gift. The garment\u2019s lack of any magical emanations shields the wearer from the scrying of the Harvesters. Abilities/Effects: This garment can be any article of clothing, from a scarf to a cloak. While wearing this garment, you are under the effects of a nondetection spell. Gauntlet of Immaculate Defense Wondrous item, rare Description: This single gauntlet is forged from metal plates, adorned with black crystals over the knuckles and forearms, and lined with fine black leather. Bound together by black chains, these gauntlets appear to be heavy at first glance, but are as light as leather gloves. History: The Legio Anguis Reptatus holds claim to the honor of having developed this protective item. However, they now see widespread use amongst the Coryani battlemages who serve within the mighty Legions of Coryan. Abilities/Effects: While wearing this gauntlet you gain a +1 bonus to your AC. Gauntlet of the Yh\u2019gi Wondrous item, rare Description: These heavy leather gauntlets are colorfully stitched and embroidered with images of soaring raptors. History: Kio are people of the sky; this is attested to in all their histories. While some may scoff at the idea of sky kingdoms, those who believe the fabled Kio homelands to be real hold up the gauntlet of the Yh\u2019gi as proof. According to legend, these gauntlets were not fashioned on Onara, but rather on the floating sky kingdoms from whence the Kio came. It is said that these falconer\u2019s gloves tap deep into the soul of a Kio, and that the spirit hawk they manifest is not a summoned creature, but rather the manifestation of a Kio\u2019s connection to the sky. The fact that non-Kio can still use these gauntlets does not seem to dissuade the true believers. Abilities/Effects: While worn, as an action you may call forth a spirit hawk. This creature possesses the regular statistics of a hawk and has resistance to nonmagical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage. Your hawk remains active until it is reduced to 0 hit points or dismissed as a bonus action. You cannot call forth another spirit hawk while you have one active. While you are within 100 feet of the hawk you may communicate with it telepathically or use an action to see though its eyes as if they were your own. While looking through your hawk\u2019s eyes you fail all ability checks based on your own sight. Once you call forth a spirit hawk, you cannot do so again until the next dawn. Gauntlets of Force Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement) Description: These heavy gauntlets typically consist of polished steel plates adorned with iron studs over the knuckles and around the wrists. Closer examination of the leather along the palms will show two designs, which form a complete Rune when both palms are held side by side. History: Helmut Steinhauer, or Helmut the Fraud as he was later known, first came to prominence in Moratavia in the ninth century. He claimed his life of asceticism and poverty granted him mystical martial arts techniques that allowed him to fire bolts of force from his hands, and he demonstrated this at small villages in the Milandisian countryside. He gathered followers among the credulous, none of whom he showed his abilities, but that did not stop them from signing over their possessions to join his \u201cOrder of the Joined Palms\u201d. As his reputation grew, however, those with more experience than Milandisian farmers quickly identified that Helmut\u2019s powers came from the magical gauntlets he wore, and not from any internal discipline or enlightenment. Helmut the Fraud fled with his ill- gotten wealth, but his gauntlets were left behind, and later duplicated by Milandisian artificers. Abilities/Effects: While wearing these gauntlets, you may fire bolts of force as a ranged weapon attack. You are proficient with these bolts of force which have a range of 20/60 and deal 1d6 bludgeoning damage. As an action, you may focus the power of both gauntlets upon a single target within range. If you hit your target with a successful ranged weapon attack, your target suffers 5d8 bludgeoning damage and must make a successful DC 15 Strength saving throw or be pushed 15 feet away from you and fall prone. Once you use this ability you cannot use it again until the next dawn. Gem of Sarish\u2019s Oath Wondrous item, very rare Description: This small green gem is marked with the holy symbol of Sarish. History: The first gems of Sarish\u2019s oath were created by Jarel, Master-Smith of the dwarven enclave of Encali. Jarel had long been fascinated with the swords created in the nearby enclave of Solanos Mor. He made a number of gems during his studies of the work of the dwarf Master Elebac, in the hopes that he might achieve a synthesis of gem and sword that would lead to the creation of the perfect item. Eventually, Jarel\u2019s jealousy of Elebac\u2019s skill consumed him, and after a botched betrayal of the rival smith, his fingers were permanently crushed by the Reavers of Bealak Gempor. Since that time gems of Sarish\u2019s oath have been created by Jarel\u2019s former apprentices, but none quite match the beauty of the originals. Abilities/Effects: This gem must be set into the pommel of an edged weapon, requiring a DC 20 Dexterity (jeweler\u2019s tool) or Dexterity (smith\u2019s tools) check. Once set, this gem cannot be removed. A weapon with this gem becomes a magical weapon. As an action, you may stare at an enemy within 30 feet and cut your own hand with this blade, reducing your hit point maximum by 4. You must also recite \u201cIswear by my blood and by Sarish that I will slay thee\u201d. This focuses the blade on your chosen target. Every time you strike a creature the blade is focused on, you deal an additional 1d6 force damage. You may not recover the any sacrificed hit points through any means or focus your blade upon a new target until your original target has been killed. Gerrard\u2019s Luxurious Pavilion Wondrous item, very rare Description: On the outside this pavilion appears to be a regular campaign tent and weighs 25 pounds. History: Gerrard val\u2019Ossan, a Milandisian court mage of some repute, was notorious as a seeker of comfort. Always looking for the easiest way to perform any given task and going out of his way to travel in the most comfortable way possible. When he was forced to go on campaign during the Heretic War, he developed a means by which he could enjoy the comforts of his extensive waterfront estate while in the depths of dreary Canceri. Many copies of this enchanted pavilion were commissioned by rich nobility since that time, who use it to flaunt their status. Abilities/Effects: By placing this tent on the ground and speaking the command word as an action, the pavilion assembles itself into lavish quarters within 1 minute. The interior of the pavilion consists of four 10-foot by 10-foot rooms, all of which are comfortable and dry, regardless of the weather outside. Each room is furnished with exquisite furniture and accessories (beds, tables, cushions, etc.), and any food stored within the pavilion is kept fresh while the pavilion is not in use. The pavilion has an AC of12 and 50 hit points. If reduced to 0 hit points, it loses all its magical properties except for its ability to be collapsed. Once collapsed, it cannot be assembled again for 7 days, after which time it recovers all its hit points and can be used as normal. Girdle of Marok Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement) Description: This belt is made from hundreds of tiny granite plates that are magically held together to form a band of moving stone. History: The elorii of Belestor crafted five great artifacts, one for each of their gods during the height of their empire. For Marok, the greatest Marokene artificers crafted a girdle that granted tremendous power over the element of earth. While only one such artifact was ever created, and subsequently lost in the fall of Belestor, it inspired elorii artificers to create the girdles of Marok in lesser imitation. Because the original girdle was lost during the Great Betrayal, these items became symbols of what the Elorii had lost to the humans. The Marokene who sacked the First City at the fall of the Theocracy of the Cleansing Flame wore girdles of Marok proudly during their inexorable march of vengeance. Abilities/Effects: While wearing this belt, your Strength score becomes 19. This ability has no effect if your Strength is already 19 or higher. In addition, while you are wearing this belt and in direct contact with the earth, you gain resistance to acid damage. Girdle of the Grand Gladiator Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunementj Description: This girdle is made of seven steel and gold alloyed plates, each embossed with scenes from the victories of the gladiator for whom it is made, and set with precious gemstones on a belt of mesh. This belt is truly glorious to behold. History: It was Carrok the Black, one of the greatest gladiators ever to bloody the arenas of Sicaris, who commissioned the first girdle of the grand gladiator, engraved with his many victories. Having won his freedom and his fortune many times over, Carrok fought for love of the arena. Fie was a larger-than-life figure, known for his grand theatrics and many public feuds and rivalries with other gladiators, prompting many grudge matches. When Carrok finally retired, one of the few gladiators to do so, others with the means sought to cash in on his fame by having their own girdles made, emblazoned with their own victories. It was these later gladiators that began the tradition of keeping and wearing the girdles of any opponents slain in the arena, thus ensuring the legends of the fallen would never vanish. Abilities/Effects: As long as you are not wearing any armor, when you wear this belt your AC is equal to 14 + you Dexterity modifier. In addition, you gain advantage on Charisma (Intimidate) checks while this belt is worn. Gloves of Arcane Manipulation Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement by an arcane spellcaster) Description: These plain and undecorated gloves consist of thin leather and seem to lack stitching of any kind, as if they have been created from the flayed skin of someone or something\u2019s hands. History: It is rare for a magical item to be created by someone without spellcasting talent, but such is the origin of gloves of arcane manipulation. Niloc of Semar was one of the most prolific archeologists, some would say tomb robbers, ever to be part of the Emerald Society. His many expeditions led to nearly as many near-death experiences. Finally, weary of constantly being a target for every magical trap devised by an ancient civilization, Niloc began a study of magical artificing to find a way to better protect himself. The result was gloves of arcane manipulation. It was not until long after Niloc had entered a Myrantian tomb and never returned that spellcasters discovered the gloves\u2019 secondary ability of storing spell levels, something Niloc\u2019s notes referred to as an \u201codd tingling sensation\u201d that would have to be \u201cfixed in a later design\u201d. Abilities/Effects: While these gloves are worn, if you are targeted by a spell that only affects you (not a spell with an area of effect) you may, as a reaction, gain advantage on that spell\u2019s saving throw. If you roll a 20 on this saving throw, and the spell is of 5 th level or lower, you absorb the spell\u2019s power into your gloves. You may use the absorbed spell\u2019s spell slot, instead of one of your own, for 1 minute. Once these gloves have absorbed a spell they may not do so again until the next dawn. Gloves of Shadow Storage Wondrous item, rare Description: These unremarkable gloves appear to be just other pair of well-worn gloves, except for the inner lining of the palm upon which is inscribed a unique glyph. History: First appearing in the Shadow Towns of the League of Princes, it is believed that these gloves may have been recovered from an ancient tomb or recovered ssethric treasure trove. Regardless, their clear utility in both larceny and espionage all but guaranteed their reproduction and sale by gifted runesmiths and arcanists alike. Abilities/Effects: While worn, as a bonus action you can store any item with a weight of up to 10 pounds in a small pocket in the Shadow Plane. You can retrieve this item with another bonus action. Each glove can only hold 1 item at a time. Due to the way these gloves store their items, these gloves may be safely transported through Ansharan portals or even stored extra dimensional spaces such as a bag of holding. Gloves of Skillful Manipulation Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement) Description: These fine gray gloves are crafted from the softest leather and cover the owner\u2019s hands to the wrist. The leather has been expertly tooled with images of exotic birds. History: First appearing upon the hands of Nedra of Old Coryan, the exact origin of the gloves remains a mystery. Some speculate that they were a gift from an amorous mage, while others figure they were a payoff from the same source. Nedra\u2019s own origins are also wrapped in mystery, but it is believed that the charismatic raven-haired beauty was born a street urchin. How she spent her early years no one truly knows, but by age 15, she had become one of the most feared members of Old Coryan\u2019s underworld. Nedra dealt in secrets and everyone has something to hide. She was somehow able to steal documents through windows no larger than the documents themselves. Even secure and locked chests were no obstacle. A blackmailer discovered that the padlock on his office chest had been picked, opened, and valuable documents stolen, all with no sign that Nedra had ever entered the room. Footprints were found at the window outside, but the window itself was far too small for even a child to fit through. By the time she was a young woman, her influence had grown to the point where Emperor Almeric val\u2019Assante offered her a position in the Imperial Court. Nedra was granted lands and title, and upon her deathbed she left all her worldly possessions to her daughter. The family fortune, including the gloves that Nedra so carefully kept secret, have been passed down through the generations. Abilities/Effects: These gloves have 3 charges. While worn, as an action you may expend 1 charge to conjure a pair of disembodied ethereal gray hands. These hands can appear anywhere within 30 feet of you and mimic the exact movements of your own hands; they even possess a sense of touch. You can perform any tasks or skills you could normally do with your own hands with the disembodied hands except that they cannot attack or lift more than 5 pounds. These hands have a range of 60 feet. The gloves regain 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn Gloves of the Diplomat Wondrous item, very rare Description: This item is an ornate pair of white gloves made from the finest calf hide. Patterned in silver thread with the symbol of Sarish, these well-crafted gloves cover the wearer\u2019s hands to wrist. Their true power comes into effect whenever the wearer is involved in a deal of a diplomatic nature. History: The first pair appeared in the early 11 th century on the hands of Rofel Ovidius val\u2019Mehan of Coryan. Rofel\u2019s sensible words and skills at oration allowed him to rise quickly through the ranks and gain a position of prestige inthe Imperial Court. Rofel\u2019s powers of persuasion were well known, and as a diplomat he had no peer. Emperor Aurelius appointed Rofel ambassador (diplomatic legate) to Canceri, a perilous post that he held for twenty years. Rofel did much to improve relations between the two col Soon after Rofel\u2019s death, these gloves passed on to a new ambassador, Asten Ovidius val\u2019Mehan. Unlike his predecessor, the young, and some would say naive, Asten quickly fell prey to the machinations of Cancerese politics and has been missing for several years. More recently, these or a similar pair of gloves have been seen \u201cV ^ A . \u0416* worn by a val\u2019Mehan emissary who was appointed a Coryanidiplomatic legate. Abilities/Effects: Any time you shake hands with another intelligent creature while wearing these gloves, that creature they must succeed in a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or suffer disadvantage on all Wisdom (Insight) and Charisma (Deception or Persuasion) checks for the next hour when dealing with you and your allies. If they succeed on their save, the creature becomes immune to the glove\u2019s effects for 1 year. Any creatures affected by the gloves must also make a successful DC 18 Intelligence saving throw to become aware of the magical influence of the gloves. If they fail, they are unaware of the gloves\u2019 effects. Gloves of the Mortis Ceres Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement) Description: These bone-white gloves, woven from thick strands of spider silk, come to just above the wrist. History: The first of these gloves were created during the height of the Myrantian Empire by worshipers of Mahememnun, the Myrantian god of the underworld. When the Second Crusade of Light brought the Myrantians under Coryani rule, these items were discovered by Ventakan Nerothians attached to the Legio Mortis Ceres. Realizing that the Mother Church would consider an item dedicated to a foreign god blasphemous, but not wishing to give up their extensive power, the Nerothians renamed them the gloves of the Mortis Ceres, and claimed to have invented the gloves themselves. Some of these Nerothians later returned to Ventaka, and in the modern day, it is these Nerothians and the priests of Mahememnun of the Abessian Dominion who continue to create the gloves. Abilities/Effects: These gloves have 3 charges and regain 1d3 expended charges daily at midnight. If you use the gloves\u2019 last charge, roll a d20. On a roll of 1, you gain 1 level of exhaustion and the gloves gain 1 charge as they pull upon your life force to power their effects. While these gloves are worn, you may expend those charges to use the following abilities. Feed upon the Soul: You may use an action and expend 2 charges to cast vampiric touch, using Charisma as your spellcasting ability.

These temporary hit points remain for 1 hour. Gloves of the Scoundrel Wondrous item, uncommon Description: These gloves are made of soft and supple black leather that fits snuggly around the wearer\u2019s hands. The back of the gloves is lightly rippled, while the palms are smooth and easy to grip things with. History: These gloves first became known after a rash of pickpocketing and thievery in Savona. When the gang of thieves was rounded up, it was discovered that they all wore gloves that magically improved their abilities. Several curious artificers attempted to track the gloves\u2019 origins, finally finding the black-market dealer who had first sold the gloves in Savona. He said he had received them from a thief, but that thief was found poisoned. No other evidence was apparent, and the poisoning had all the signs of a professional assassination. Recently the Emerald Society has claimed to have found similar gloves in the ruins of the First City, identical to the Savonan gloves save for their age and the inclusion of an obsidian disk embroidered into the leather. Abilities/Effects: While worn, these gloves grant advantage on Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) checks and you may cast mage hand. Gris-Gris Bag Wondrous item, uncommon or rare Description: This woven satchel always seems to contain exactly what a hedge mage needs. History: The gris-gris bag is one of the oldest magic items known, perhaps as old as magic itself. When Sarish first gifted arcane magic to mankind, so says the legend, he gave its secrets to only a chosen few. From these few, five were chosen to wander the land and find other humans worthy of learning the secret power. They each created a woven bag and filled it with whatever useful and magical things they discovered on their journey. By the time their journey was finished, the bags had become magical in their own right. Though the original five bags were lost long before humans came to the Known Lands, their many imitations are still prized among hedge mages. Abilities/Effects: An uncommon gris-gris bag is considered both an arcane focus and a set of alchemist\u2019s supplies. The rare versions of these bags allow you to reach into the bag as an action and draw forth any uncommon or rare potion, or an alchemical item worth 100gp or less. This item must be used within 1 minute or it crumbles to dust. Once an item is drawn from the bag, you may not draw forth another until the next dawn. Hairpins of Prehensile Coiffure Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement) Description: These are two long-needle hairpins with enameled butterflies as handles. While worn, the wearer\u2019s hair grows into a thick, luxurious mane of hair that cascades in graceful curls to the small of the wearer\u2019s back. History: These pins were crafted by the Laerestri Osalikene mage Yanavalas as a gift to her longtime associate, a Larissan priestess whose long curls were shorn during an ill-fated excursion into Canceri. Upon her return to Savona, the use of stylish hairpins caught on and within a year, they were the height of fashion. To this day, it is impossible to find many prosperous ladies of Savona walking the streets with a mundane version of these hairpins. Abilities/Effects: This hairpin may be used as a magic dagger. While it is worn, you may use an action to cause your hair to grow out up to 10 feet in length and split into 4 independent appendages. These appendages remain active for 5 minutes or until they are reduced to 0 hit points. Once animated your hair may not be animated again until you complete a long rest. Your hair appendages are magic bludgeoning weapons with the finesse quality; they deal 1d6 magical bludgeoning damage with a successful attack. Additionally, may spend a bonus action to use your hair appendages while grappling, granting you advantage on all Strength (Athletics) and Dexterity (Athletics) checks made to establish or during a grapple. Each appendage may be independently targeted and has AC 14, and 20 hit points; they share all your other attributes. You may also use these appendages to perform delicate tasks, such as writing or picking a lock, but these actions are performed with disadvantage. Harness of Carrying Wondrous item, uncommon Description: This sturdy harness of tooled leather is large enough to buckle on over armor. History: In the sixth century Cael, the newest apprentice to an Encali master smith, grew weary of being constantly used for manual labor and forced to help merchants load crate after crate of her master\u2019s merchandise into wagons. Late at night, and cautiously so as to avoid being caught by her master, Cael created the first harness of carrying. When she defiantly used the harness during the next day\u2019s labor her master was impressed, and reassigned Cael to the workshop where she belonged. He also took credit for Cael\u2019s creation, and became a very wealthy dwarf. Abilities/Effects: While wearing this harness your Strength score is considered 4 points higher for determining what you can lift or carry. Harness of Hauling Wondrous item, very rare Description: This heavy leather harness is designed to fit around the front of a horse, but can be adapted to any other Medium or Large mount. History: Found by the Emerald Society explorers in the ruins near sunken Myrantis, it is believed that these harnesses were created by that ancient land\u2019s fell sorcerers. They speculate that it allowed their beasts of burden to move the immense black basalt blocks that make up the cyclopean ziggurats that dot that region. Abilities/Effects: A beast wearing this harness has their Strength score increased by 2, to a maximum of 20. If you are using the encumbrance variant rule, a beast wearing this harness can carry up to 10 times their Strength before being encumbered and up to 20 times their Strength before being heavily encumbered. Headband of Delusion Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement) Description: This headband is made of pyrite and studded with three pieces of quartz. History: The age of eloran rule was a time of great peace, but that did not stop Parados, an Ardakene priest, from seeing danger around every corner. His fellow elorii tried to soothe his paranoia, but over the centuries it merely grew stronger. He crafted many items for his protection, but few of them served any useful function. One of the few that did he called the headband of invincibility. He wore it everywhere, but it did not diminish his fears. He died before reaching his first millennium, slain by a bolt of lightning. His most famous creation is now called the headband of delusion, and has become a cautionary tale. Abilities/Effects: This headband has 3 charges; when the last charge is expended the headband crumbles into dust. While wearing this headband, you may use an action and expend a charge to gain a limited form of regeneration, healing 5 hit points of slashing, piercing, or bludgeoning damage at the beginning of every turn for 10 turns. Additionally, if you are ever reduced to 0 hit points or less you automatically succeed on your first death saving throw and regain 5 hit points at the beginning of your next turn. Headdress of Osalian Wondrous item, uncommon Description: A tooled midnight blue leather band, just under an inch wide, circles the head to form this headdress. From each temple, secured by metal clasps, are two feathers. The four feathers are taken from a crow, an eagle, a hawk and an owl. A blue jade talisman hangs over the forehead, depicting the face of an elorii. History: When Osalian was destroyed, those elorii who worshiped Him lost their divine connection and their spells. For Marithea, one of the most devoted and popular of Osalian\u2019s priesthood, this only increased her devotion to His memory. For centuries she toiled, researching arcane magic to replace the divine magic she had lost, but never failing to continue the rituals of her priestly service to her now-dead lord. Finally, she used her new powers to create the headdresses of Osalian, which are now worn by elorii who, like her, refuse to surrender their faith. Abilities/Effects: These headdresses possess 4 feathers. While wearing this headdress, you may use an action to pull one of the feathers out of the headdress and cast conjure animals, summoning the type of bird that feather was taken from. You can only have one bird summoned at a time and when a particular feather is used it cannot be used again until the next dawn. Holiday Hat Wondrous item, uncommon Description: Made from straw, and fitted with a band of bird feathers around the brim, the hat both shades the wearer and is stylish. Some hats have feathers solely from one bird, while others have a mixture. History: Kio tend to have fair complexions that are easily burned by the sun, so they took to wearing broad-brimmed straw hats to protect their faces while on journeys. Because these hats were often used by Kio on religious pilgrimages, they became known as \u201choliday hats\u201d. Most Kio own such a hat, but for Antarn Hallgyphe val\u2019Sungha this was not enough. She commissioned Phirae Veghellio, the famous Kio artificer, to enchant her holiday hat with further protections against the elements. Since that time Veghellio has created similar items for other Kio nobles, and the holiday hat has gained prominence in Kio fashion. Abilities/Effects: While this hat is worn you are not subject to the effects of weather. If worn while taking a short rest, you may recover 1 level of exhaustion. Once the hat\u2019s ability to recover from exhaustion is used it cannot be used again until you have completed a long rest. Holy Symbol of Rage\u2019s Fury Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement) Description: Crafted from the blood tinted gold of Canceri, this holy symbol of Nier seems to glow with an eerie crimson radiance and always feels warm to the touch. With its power, the possessor of the amulet may call upon the passion of the soul to ignite i heir Iuiy. History: First created by a priest attached to the Legion of Searing Light prior to Canceri secession from the Coryani Empire, the secrets of forging these amulets have slowly spread among the clergy of Nier in Canceri. Today, these amulets are given as awards of honor to soldiers who show bravery in battle. Abilities/Effects: While this amulet is worn you may use a bonus action to gain a +2 bonus to all melee damage rolls for 1 minute. Once this ability is used you may not call upon it again until you complete a short rest. Hood of the Cat\u2019s Meow Wondrous item, uncommon Description: This hood is fashioned from matted fur and has the texture of felt; it also has triangular patches that resemble feline ears. The color is usually black but sometimes matches the hair color of the crafter or intended wearer of the hood. The hood can be worn with a cape or other outer garment, and it is sometimes found with a cape of feline form. History: After Gilberta val\u2019Mehan refused the amorous advances of a powerful nobleman she found herself accused of witchcraft and consorting with demons. She fled to the Faerdwalden, where she intended to live a life of quiet devotion to Sarish. That changed when she found a badly injured cat at the edge of the woods. Then another. Then more. After nursing them back to health she found herself intrigued by the mystery, and calling upon Sarish\u2019s power she crafted the first hood of the cat\u2019s meow from their matted fur. What she learned from her feline friends led to her becoming the feared Cat Witch of Faerdwalden, who figures so prominently in Milandisian folk legends from the Shadowed Age. Abilities/Effects: As long as this hood is worn, you possess the ability to speak to felines as if you were under the effects of a continuous speak with animals spell. Horn of Saluwe\u2019s Bounty Wondrous item, very rare Description: Similar to its more common cousin, this ram\u2019s horn is gilded in gold and carved with images of bountiful harvests. History: These horns T. were also instrumental in lifting the siege of Panari during the Shadowed Age, when the fledgling Tenecian Empire sought to conquer the val\u2019Dellenov stronghold. Eventually, unable to starve the inhabitants into submission, the Tenecians returned to their lands, defeated. In the modern day, the horns are used to commemorate that ancient victory with an elaborate fete, where rich and poor dine at the same communal table, remembering the hardship their ancestors endured together. Abilities/Effects: If you speak a prayer to Saluwe and blow this horn you can cast heroes\u2019 feast. Once this ability is used it cannot be used again until 7 days have passed. Horn of Saluwe\u2019s Plenty Wondrous item, uncommon Description: This ram\u2019s horn is scrimshawed with images of menageries and gardens. The inside rim of the device is scribed with benedictions to Saluwe, asking for the blessing of her bounty. History: These items are usually crafted and used by the clergy of Saluwe to relieve areas that are suffering from famine or drought. When not in use, most of these horns are kept in the Temple of Saluwe in Panari. Abilities/Effects: If you speak a prayer to Saluwe and blow this horn you can cast create food and water. Once this ability is used it cannot be used again until the next dawn. Horn of Terror Wondrous item, very rare Description: This horn, carved from a large infernal\u2019s horn, is inlayed in gold and onyx. History: During the First Crusade of Light many infernal horns were taken as trophies, and those who took them were spared the wrath of the Inquisition because, separated from their host, they were believed harmless. It was not until the second century that Eligius val\u2019Assante, being a dissolute scion of the family with an unhealthy interest in infernals, dared to take his noble ancestor\u2019s trophy and subject it to magical experiment. The result was the first horn of terror. Few of these horns have been made, and if the Inquisition knew just what materials they were made from, they would certainly try to destroy them. It is said that when the last of the infernals have been vanquished that these horns shall crumble to dust. Abilities/Effects: As an action you may blow this horn to force all living creatures within 60 feet to make a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened until the end of their next turn. If you possess infernal blood (if you are a dark-kin, for example) the saving throw is increased to DC 19. Once used this ability cannot be used again until the next midnight. Horn of War Wondrous item, very rare Description: This horn appears to be made of a tarnished brass metal, looking as if it were partially made from a piece of charcoal. It can be worn slung over the shoulder on a leather thong. History: In the latter days of the First Imperium, val\u2019Virdan who specialized in working with war dogs, were known as the Hellhounds. One Hellhound, Cassia val\u2019Virdan, created the first horn of war so she could summon her beloved dogs to her side whenever she chose. To her surprise, her commanders confiscated her creation and told her to remain silent. Their reasoning became clear years later, when the Theocracy of the Cleansing Flame conquered the Imperium, and horns of war were used in the vanguard. These horns are still found among the Erdukeen. Abilities/Effects: As an action you may blow this horn to produce one of two effects. You may either summon 4 mastiffs as if you had cast conjure animals or you may choose to cast bless (no concentration required) on up to 6 friendly creatures. Once either of these abilities are used, this horn may not be used again until the next dawn. Horn of Winter Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement) Description: This horn is made of enchanted ice, kept perpetually frozen. The ice is as hard as steel, and is elaborately carved and embossed with images of mountains, glaciers and arctic beasts. History: The first of these horns known in modern times, and the template from which all modern horns of winter were created, was found clutched in the arms of a half-crazed pilgrim who came staggering out of the Blessed Lands. For years, its origin was the subject of much debate, but recent Azure Way efforts in the First City have discovered multiple ssethric records recounting battle with the Cyclopes and describing such horns. That, plus the strange writing on the original horn, point to a cyclopean origin. Abilities/Effects: While you are attuned to this horn, you gain resistance to cold damage. As an action, you can blow this horn to cast cone of cold (DC 15). Once this ability is used you may not use it again until the next dawn. Icon of Spirit Storing Wondrous item, legendary (requires attunement to a location) Description: These icons are crafted into various shapes, with the most famous being the leering skulls of Enpebyn. History: The largest collection of these icons located in the city of Enpebyn, until, during the Coryani Civil War, a large portion of the city caved in and fell into the Endless Dark and most of the icons were lost. Each icon represents a single creature and must be specifically made for each creature that is to be bound into it. For example, the icons located in Enpebyn contain the souls of the legionnaires of the Doom of Chendo legion. Abilities/Effects: These icons can be attuned to a location 1 mile in diameter and the ritual that attunes the icon to its location traps the soul of an intelligent creature within it. They are designed to fulfill a specific task, such as fighting a fire or defending a city from invaders, which is set when the icon is attuned. Once the specific condition set during the ritual is met, the icon summons forth a ghost which performs the specified task to the best of its ability. If the ghost is destroyed in combat, then the icon is destroyed with it. It is unknown what happens to a creature\u2019s soul when the icon is destroyed. Some conjecture that having served their time, they are admitted directly to paradise, bypassing the Judgement of Nier, while others claim that they are simply destroyed and do not even face the Judgement. The truth of what happens is liable to never be known. The icon itself can be of any size and can be destroyed as easily any item of its size and construction. Destroying an icon releases the soul bound within it. See Location Attunement Sidebar, pg. 103. Jar of Preservation Wondrous item, legendary Description: This thick glass jar comes with a lead stopper. The stopper for each jar is unique, and all bear a different glyph. This glyph is indecipherable, even by magic, and is presumed by scholars to simply be a marking to differentiate between jars. History: Recent findings by the Azure Way in the labyrinth beneath the First City have finally shed light on the origins of these strange jars. They were encountered by the Ssethregoran armies upon their defeat of the Issori. The Issori were attempting to preserve their larvae within the jars, presumably to resurrect their race at a later date. The Ssethregorans smashed all the jars they found and destroyed the larvae, but they soon learned to recreate the magic items for their own purposes. They remained in use throughout the Yahssremoran Empire, but the knowledge of how to make these items seems to have been lost with the rebellion of the elorii. Abilities/Effects: Any item placed within this jar enters suspended animation and will not age or decay. Only creatures or items of Tiny or Small size can be stored in the jar. If the jar is broken, anything within is freed and once again subject to the normal passing of time. Kirtle of Keepsakes Wondrous item, uncommon Description: Resembling the type of short coats that are typically worn under cloaks or robes, this magical garment has ten hidden pockets.\u2003 History: All Tevil the haberdasher ever wanted was to be respected in his hometown of Plexus. When he, almost by accident, created the first kirtle of keepsakes, he thought it might finally bring him the honor he wanted. However, few were impressed by what seemed to be mere sleight of hand using hidden pockets, so in frustration Tevil began embellishing his story. With each telling the tale grew grander, until Tevil was rumored to be a secret master of magic whose haberdashery was merely a disguise. Finally, he had the respect he deserved, but not for long. Being a rumored mage is a dangerous thing, and Tevil was harvested from his home one night. With no actual magical gift to bargain with, Tevil met his end at the hands of an Ymandrake interrogator. Abilities/Effects: This shirt possesses 10 cleverly hidden pockets. While worn you easily find these pockets, but anyone else must succeed at a DC 25 Intelligence (Investigation) check to locate them. Each pocket can hold one item the size of a potion vial, or you may split up one set of small tools (such as thief\u2019s tools) into 3 pockets. Lantern of Restless Warding Wondrous item, very rare Description: This hooded lantern is made from steel that has been plated with hammered white-gold sheets. History: After the Cult of the Thousand-Eyed Man arose during the reign of Eladru val\u2019Assante, the Inquisition realized they needed an order of elite inquisitors able to deal with the ghastliest of heresies. Thus, they founded the Praecelsus Quaestor Lumens, the High Seekers of the Light. Lanterns of restless wardingsNfztfz first created for these elite inquisitors, to illuminate the dark places and to ward against infernals. Since the death of Felician val\u2019Mehan the order has dwindled, and now numbers less than one hundred, while most of the lanterns have been lost. Abilities/Effects: When lit and the hood opened, this lantern sheds bright light in a 60-foot radius and dim light 60-feet beyond that. As an action, you may set the lantern down and pour a vial of holy water into the lantern to cast magic circle (affecting infernals, save DC 16), centered on the lamp. If you move the lantern, the effect ends. Once used, this ability cannot be used again until the next dawn. Lantern of the Archaeologist Wondrous item, rare Description: This large, bronze, hooded lantern is ornate, with an inscription etched into the inside of the lens hood. Bronze birds with outstretched wings decorate either side of the lantern. History: It is no surprise that these lanterns were first created by the Emerald Society, though perhaps the motives behind their creation is more curious. A particularly secretive sect within the Emerald Society sought to ensure that no spies could steal their discoveries, and so they created a vault protected by cleverly hidden traps and riddles in obscure languages. They then made the first of these lanterns to give to their inner circle, with the idea that only someone KELB\u2019BAKARI LIGHTS THE WAY WITH THE LANTERN OF THE ARCHEOLOGIST\u2003 with such a lantern could avoid the traps and interpret the riddles. So secure were they in this belief that they let other security grow lax, and they were soon robbed blind by a particularly skilled thief. Abilities/Effect: This lantern has 3 charges and regain 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn. While this lantern is lit, as an action you may use 1 charge to cast either comprehend languages or find traps with an area of effect limited to the area illuminated by the lantern\u2019s bright light. Larissa\u2019s Coin Wondrous item, uncommon Description: This is a small gold coin with the visage of Larissa smiling on one side and frowning on the other. History: When the first Fatespinner revealed herself to the Larissan clergy, they were skeptical. Clearly the Fatespinner had martial ability, and some skill with divine magic, but how could she prove that she was truly connected to the web of fate? The Fatespinner proposed a test. A gold coin stamped with Larissa\u2019s visage was brought, a skeptical Larissan called smile or frown in the air, and the Fatespinner manipulated the strands of fate to make it land accordingly. Time and time again she demonstrated this, finally proving her ability. The coin, so frequently subject to manipulation of the strands of fate, absorbed some of the Fatespinner\u2019s own power, becoming the first Larissa\u2019s coin. Abilities/Effects: You may flip this coin as an action while willing it to alter your fate. The GM flips a coin, with you calling heads or tails. The GM then makes note of the result without informing you. If your call was correct, you automatically roll a 20 on your next saving throw. If you called it incorrectly, you automatically roll a 1 on your next saving throw. Once thrown, this coin may not be used again until the next dawn. Laurel of Glory Wondrous item, very rare Description: This laurel wreath appears to be made of pure gold but is as strong as iron and very light. It may be worn alone or attached to helm. History: One of the highest honors that may be granted to a citizen of the Coryani Empire, the laurel of glory is awarded for acts of selflessness, and fearlessness in the defense of the Empire. Those who wear these laurels will find that they are given deference by both plebian and noble alike. Abilities/Effects: While this laurel is worn you gain advantage on all saving throws to avoid gaining the charmed or frightened condition. When while acting in the direct defense of the Coryani Empire and its citizens (such as fighting a foreign invader or defending a member of the senate from assassination) you may cast bless upon yourself as a bonus action. Once this ability is used you may not use it again until the next dawn. Duty Above All (Requires Attunement): Once attuned to this item you may not end that attunement unless targeted by the remove curse spell. You have advantage on all attack rolls made to directly defend the sitting Emperor of Coryan or a sitting member of the Imperial Senate, even when not wearing the laurel. If you ever attack (even unwillingly) the sitting Emperor of Coryan or a sitting member of the Imperial Senate you suffer 10d6 psychic damage and the laurel crumbles to dust. Legionnaire\u2019s Crest Wondrous item, uncommon Description: These brilliantly colored red crests are used to adorn the helms of Coryani\u2019s most dedicated legionnaires. History: The first legionnaire\u2019s crests were created not for the Coryani Empire, but during the latter days of the Imperium of Man. The Imperator commanded crests be made for each and every soldier in his legions, a staggering expense that only confirmed the decadence of the Imperator and sparked unrest among his people. When the Imperium fell, the crests became a symbol of the corruption of the old regime. All that were found were burned at the command of the Sword of the Heavens, and the few that survived the flames were lost during the Shadowed Age. The secret of their creation was rediscovered in the second century, and the crests are now a signature item of the Coryani legions. Abilities/Effects: While this crest is attached to a helm you are wearing, as an action you may cast enhance ability upon yourself. Once used, you cannot use this ability again until you have completed a short or long rest. Duty Above All (Requires Attunement): Once attuned to this item you may not end that attunement unless targeted by the remove curse spell. You have advantage on all attack rolls made to directly defend the sitting Emperor of Coryan or a sitting member of the Imperial Senate, even when not wearing the laurel. If you ever attack (even unwillingly) the sitting Emperor of Coryan or a sitting member of the Imperial Senate you suffer 10d6 psychic damage and the crest crumbles to dust. Legionnaire\u2019s Pin Wondrous item, rare Description: This pin is shaped like a falcon in flight. History: This is a pin granted to legionnaire\u2019s who go above and beyond the call of duty, risking their lives and exemplifying the ideals of the Empire.\u2003 Abilities/Effects: While this pin is worn you gain advantage on all saving throws to avoid gaining the charmed or frightened condition. Duty Above All (Requires Attunement): Once attuned to this item you may not end that attunement unless targeted by the remove curse spell. You have advantage on all attack rolls made to directly defend the sitting Emperor of Coryan or a sitting member of the Imperial Senate, even when not wearing the laurel. If you ever attack (even unwillingly) the sitting Emperor of Coryan or a sitting member of the Imperial Senate you suffer 10d6 psychic damage and the pin crumbles to dust. Lord Anesche\u2019s Bags Wondrous item, rare or very rare Description: These sets of bags, each weighing approximately 15 pounds, appear to be made of fine velvet, and are often crafted with an embroidered symbol unique to the owner of these bags. One of the set, known as the master bag, additionally has gold-inlayed rope to tie it shut. History: The first set of these bags was created soon after the Blessed Lands were re-opened to pilgrims. An enterprising merchant realized that, with these bags, he could keep most of his stock safely locked away in his wagon, while producing whatever items he wished to sell from the personal bag he carried. It did not take long for other merchants to seek similar bags, and then for smugglers and spies to see the possibilities. In the eighth century, a spy within Quron val\u2019Dellenov\u2019s palace used these bags to pass messages to a Khitani agent outside the palace walls. Since that time many nations have become wary of these bags, and have sought wards which disrupt their abilities. Abilities/Effect: These bags are always found in sets of ld6+l with one, usually the finest looking bag of the set, being the \u201cmaster\u201d bag. Each bag is roughly 2 feet in diameter at the mouth and 4 feet deep. You can reach into any of the bags and pull out an item from any bag in the set that is within 100 feet. If any of the bags are overloaded, pierced, or torn, it ruptures and is destroyed, immediately removing it from the set. If the master bag is destroyed all bags in the set revert to simple non-magical bags. The very rare version of this item shares all of the same properties as the rare version, but it has no master bag. As such, in order to destroy a set of these bags, every bag has to be destroyed. Lord Khidath\u2019s Guard Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement) Description: Inscribed with ancient Altharin writing, this Auxunite armor first appears as a wide golden collar that expands into light, flanged armor and helm when the command word is spoken. History: Worn by one of the most feared warlords of the Auxunite Empire, Lord Khidath ruled over large swaths of modern day Milandir. The Milandisians, led by the val\u2019Tensen family, attempted to assassinate their cruel overlord over a hundred times, but failed due to this armor\u2019s enchantment. Abilities/Effects: While this collar is worn, as a bonus action you may use the collar to manifest a suit of armor. This armor grants you an Armor Class of 15 + your Dexterity modifier (to a maximum of +2) and darkvision to 60 feet. This collar may be activated for a total of 10 minutes before the magic in it ceases to function. These 10 minutes do not need to be consecutive, but must be activated for a minimum of 1 minute at a time. Once all 10 minutes have been used the collar ceases to function until you finish a long rest.\u2003 Lyde\u2019s Veil of Persuasion Wondrous item, rare Description: This veil consists of a fine mesh of white lace attached to a comb headpiece. History: The sorceress Vorena val\u2019Assante created this veil as a gift for her sister Lyde, who had ambitions of becoming a senator. Lyde at first refused to compromise her ideals by resorting to such tricks, and with her own skill she became the first woman to serve on the Imperial Senate. However, her fellow senators treated her as a political prop, and gave no heed to a woman\u2019s arguments, no matter how sound. Thus, she remembered her sister\u2019s gift. For more than a decade Lyde val\u2019Assante was one of the most respected politicians on the senate, the veil ever present on her face whenever she was in public. More than once it was commented on that it always seemed to complement the dress she had chosen that day. One day Lyde val\u2019Assante disappeared without a trace. Her home was in order with nothing out of place, save one thing; her veil was nowhere to be found. Abilities/Effects: While this veil is worn you have advantage on all Charisma (Deception or Persuasion) and Wisdom (Insight) checks. This veil has 3 charges, and regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn. While wearing this veil, you can use your action to expend 1 charge to cast charm person (save DC 13) on a humanoid you can see within 30 feet of you. Maliar\u2019s Magnificent Laboratory Wondrous item, rare Description: At first glance this miniature house seems like nothing more than a well-made child\u2019s plaything. History: Maliar val\u2019Sheem, Mage-Alchemist of Milandir, built a laboratory on the shores of the Gulf of Yarris so she could complete her master work. No sooner had she begun, however, then her laboratory was destroyed in the conflict between Ymandragore and King Osric I of Milandir. Maliar was displaced and moved inland, but her second laboratory was destroyed by encroaching Yhing hir barbarians several years later, again destroying all her research. Spurred by these frustrating events, Maliar vowed to create a laboratory that no army could destroy. After more years of research, and losing a third laboratory to a freak accident, she succeeded in creating the first of her magnificent laboratories. Abilities/Effects: You can use an action to place this small toy house on the ground and speak its command word. This toy home rapidly grows into a 20 ft. by 20 ft. by 15 ft. tall one story building. You may also you use an action to speak the command word that shrinks the building back to it\u2019s toy size, which works only if no one is within. This small home consists of 3 rooms, one of which is a full laboratory that has alchemist\u2019s supplies, glassblower\u2019s tools, an herbalism kit, and a poisoner\u2019s kit. When activated, the building has a small door on the side facing you. The door opens only at your command. It is immune to the knock spell and similar magic, such as a chime of opening or skeleton key. Each creature in the area where the home appears must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 10d10 bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. In either case, the creature is pushed to an unoccupied space outside but next to the house. Objects in the area that aren\u2019t being worn or carried take this damage and are pushed automatically. The building is made of impossibly strong stone and wood. The roof, the door, and the walls each have 75 hit points, immunity to damage from nonmagical weapons excluding siege weapons, and resistance to all other damage. Mailer\u2019s magnificent laboratory can only be repaired by casting mending and expending a 9 th level spell slot, which restores the laboratory to full hit points. Manacles of Ymandragore Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement) Description: These appear like normal, heavy iron manacles, but glowing red runes appear when they are placed on any who can channel arcane power. History: When he withdrew to Ymandragore, the Sorcerer King crafted the first manacles himself. Knowing he would need servants beyond the pathetic wretches that resided upon the Isle of Tears, he sought out a powerful mage and lured her to his lair. As she prepared her spells to escape, he bound her in the manacles and all power fled from her. Recognizing the superior skill of the one who had crafted her bindings, she swore herself to him. He gave her the manacles, and declared her to be his first Harvester \u2014 or so the legend goes. Since that time there have been many more Harvesters, and many more manacles; both are feared by the mages of Onara. Abilities/Effects: When placed upon a creature, they instantly become attuned to the manacles, breaking any attunement that creature may have to other items. The attuned creature instantly loses 10 spell slots, and loses an additional 10 spell slots at the beginning of each of their turns until they have no spell slots remaining. As long as these manacles are worn, the creature cannot regain any spell slots through any known means and suffer 6d6 force damage any time they attempt to cast any spell or cantrip. Once locked, the individual who placed the manacles\u2003 on the creature may unlock them as an action with the use of a command word. They may also be unlocked with a successful dispel magic (treat the manacles as a 5 th level spell) or successful DC 20 Dexterity (thieves\u2019 tools) check. Mask of Death Wondrous item, legendary (requires attunement) Description: This alabaster stage mask is carved to look like death\u2019s head, carved flesh stretched taut over the bones of the lurid and hungry grin of the skull beneath. There is a black coif that attaches by small silver clasps to the back of the mask, covering the entire head. History: The tales told about Drusilla val\u2019lVlordane are more legend than history. It is said Neroth blessed her birth, but Cadic\u2019s Troupe of the Final Note held her devotion. She was a musician of unparalleled skill, but her tunes were melancholy and the alabaster death mask she wore hid her features. It was she who played for the court of Eladru val\u2019Assante the very night three of his advisors were found dead, with evidence of their planned treason against the Emperor on their corpses. Her mask has seen use by the Troupe since her time, on rare missions of vital importance. It is unknown how many such masks the Troupe possesses. Abilities/Effects: This mask has 3 charges and regains 1d3 expended charges daily at midnight. If you expend the mask\u2019s last charge, roll a d20. On a roll of 1 you suffer 1 level of exhaustion and the mask regains 1 expended charge as it greedily feeds upon your life force. While this mask is worn, you may use an action and expend 1 or more charges to cast following spells: fear (1 charge, save DC 15), finger of death (2 charges, save DC 16). Mask of Larissa\u2019s Blessing Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement) Description: This mask appears as a solid gold mask carved with fine facial features. The left eye opening is surrounded by deep purple gemstone inlays reminiscent of tears, while a sunburst is etched about the right. Upon the burnished forehead is a glyph of pure silver. The mask covers the wearer\u2019s entire face, even her mouth, where perfectly formed full lips are crafted into a petulant pout. History: The first of these masks was created and worn by Serena Jiuldan of Sweet Savona, a high priestess of Larissa. She served for many years in the temple to Larissa, leading a relatively peaceful, yet intrigue ridden, life. In her early thirties, Serena organized a caravan to Mil Takara to purchase rare herbs and compounds found nowhere else in the Known Lands. The purchase went smoothly, and the priestesses of Larissa left Mil Takara with mules laden with the precious herbs. During the return trip to Sweet Savona, a band of thieves and cutthroats descended upon the sleepy caravan. Shouts went up from sentries, and soon the entire camp was in chaos. Brigands were everywhere looting treasure and taking slaves. The numbers were overwhelming, and soon the thieves had ringed the last tent, where Serena stood bravely at the head of her fellow priestesses. Serena looked out in dismay at the crowd of drooling savages, and raised her arms to the heavens. Calling upon the will of Larissa, Serena cursed the brutal raiders for their greed and savagery. Taking the golden mask from her face, she threw it into the dust before the brigands. In a booming voice, she cried out \u201cLeave this place now you fools, or suffer the wrath of the gods for your greed\u201d, and with that the head priestess of Larissa slumped to the ground in exhaustion. The bloodthirsty marauders laughed at the priestess and then turned their gaze upon the solid golden mask. As one they surged forward, intent on finishing off\u2019 the survivors, and plunder their riches. As the first bandit reached the mask, there was a roar of thunder and a brilliant flash of light. A smoking hole appeared where the raider had stood. Seeing this, the raiders turned to flee, but it was too late. Soon the entire valley was lit with coruscating bolts of lightning. The raiders were incinerated where they stood, as the divine power of Hurrian reached down to protect His sister\u2019s devoted followers. The priestesses quickly packed their scattered supplies and fled. No one, not even Serena, dared to retrieve the mask of Larissa\u2019s blessing which lay upon the ground. Abilities/Effects: While you wear this mask your Charisma score is increased to 19. If you already possess a Charisma of 19 or greater you gain no benefit. Additionally, while you wear this mask, you may cast augury at will. You do not require material components to cast this spell. You may, as an action, cast this mask to the ground and gain 1 level of exhaustion to cast call lightning (save DC 17).\u2003 Mask of Steely Countenance Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement) Description: This is a full mask of silver-etched ivory carved to resemble an expressionless face. The mask is tied with a simple cord of homespun wool, dyed a deep red. The interior of the mask is covered in prayers, in sepia-ink, dedicated to Hurrian. History: When Milandir left the Coryani Empire, the val\u2019Tensen family was split down the middle. To secure the border, Augustos val\u2019Tensen, newly made Duke of Moratavia, had to hold off his former brethren. But his counterpart in Ulfila had the friendship of the Larissan temple, who sent him oracles to predict Duke Augustos\u2019 actions. In desperation, the Duke turned to the loyal Milandisian priesthood of Hurrian, who crafted blank masks for the Duke and his officers to wear to hide their plans. With this new advantage the Coryani were driven back and the border secured. Abilities/Effects: While wearing this mask, you are permanently under the effects of a nondetection spell. You also gain advantage on all saving throws against effects that read your mind or discern your emotional state. Finally, anyone attempting to discern your motives through the use of a Wisdom (Insight) check does so at disadvantage. Mask of the Petrified Goddess Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement) Description: This is an oval mask carved from greenstone in the visage of a horrible, scowling medusa. It is adorned with burnished coral, a bundle of emerald serpents for hair and a golden circle set with glittering jewels upon its brow. When the mask is donned it becomes pliant and fleshy, hugging the wearer\u2019s face as the serpent locks transform into living snakes and begin to writhe and hiss menacingly. Rumor holds that this item was first created by the diabolical priestess Amedhi-Gesu. History: There are no records of these masks before the Blessed Lands were reopened in the early days of the Coryani Empire, and even since then they are rarely found, and always in the southeast of the Blessed Lands near the petrified forest. Local tribes speak of men who go mad and flee into the forest, only to return months or years later wearing a mask and embarking on some terrible, destructive purpose. In recent years an old Erdukeen, who had marched with the Sword of the Heavens into the Blessed Lands, donned a magical mask of his own creation, killed twelve people, and petrified another before he was put down. His mask was identical to the ones found near the Petrified Forest, down to the intricately carved snakes. Abilities/Effects: While wearing this mask you can animate the snakes on the mask as a bonus action and use them to make melee weapon attacks, treating them as magical daggers. Those bitten by the snakes must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned for 1 minute. Additionally, while worn you may use an action to can cast flesh to stone (save DC 15). Once this ability is used it cannot be used again until the next dawn. Mask of the Voei Witchdoctor Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement) Description: These masks are elaborately carved to appear as fiendish creatures of nightmare. Typically, they are carved from tree bark or stone, although the witchdoctors of the larger tribes have been known to craft them from pure fervid ite. History: Within a decade of the conclusion of the second Coryani-Khitani war, the Voei had grown even more aggressive, and survivors reported their warped barbarians were now led by masked witchdoctors. It is believed that the Voei recovered magic items from the battlefields of the war and, despite their savagery, were able to gain a crude understanding of their workings. They then turned this knowledge to their own purposes, and created the masks of the Voei witchdoctor. The pilgrims of the Blessed Lands mutter that this is just one more consequence of the schism between the nations of Man. Abilities/Effects: While you wear this mask you gain advantage on all Charisma (Intimidation) checks. This mask has 3 charges, and regains ld3 expended charges daily at midnight. As an action, you may expend 1 or more charges to cast one of the following spells: bane (1 charge, save DC 15), bestow curse (2 charges, save DC 15). Mirror of Minions Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement to a location [room]) Description: This large oval glass mirror is set into a silver stand. The two upright poles that support the mirror are cunningly worked to resemble a stylized man and woman, holding it at waist height. History: The first of these were commissioned by Emperor Quron val\u2019Dellenov for his Palace of Mirrors. The palace was built during the months leading up to the insurrection that saw Canceri, Milandir and Altheria secede from the Empire. By the time the palace was finished, Emperor Quron had already been executed and replaced. However, it was too late; his madness had cost the Empire dearly. The palace was abandoned and overrun by squatters before being partially gutted by fire in 905 I.C. Most of the mirrors were destroyed either by the squatters or the fire, but some precious few survived. Abilities/Effects: This mirror can be attuned to any room of no more than 100 square feet. Once the mirror is attuned, you can use an action to look into the mirror causing it to produce 8 illusionary doubles that last for 1 hour. The duplicates move with you and mimic your actions, shifting position so it\u2019s impossible to track which image is real. You can use your action to dismiss 1 or more of the illusory duplicates. As long as you have at least one illusory duplicate remaining, each time a creature targets you with an attack, determine randomly whether the attack instead targets one of your duplicates. A duplicate\u2019s AC equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier. If an attack hits a duplicate, the duplicate is destroyed. A duplicate can be destroyed only by an attack that hits it. It ignores all other damage and effects. The effect ends when all duplicates are destroyed. A creature is unaffected by this effect if it can\u2019t see, if it relies on senses other than sight, such as blindsight, or if it can perceive illusions as false, as with truesight. Once this ability is used, the mirror cannot be used to create these illusionary doubles until the next dawn. See Location Attunement Sidebar, pg. 103. Missive Wondrous item, uncommon Description: This delicate construct is made of cloth and wood, and is used by divine spellcasters as a means of sending messages or magical aid to distant fellows. They are often used to link the sanctums of the various cults and temples in the Blessed Lands. Superficially, the missive resembles a bird or bat and is usually painted with its creator\u2019s symbol of faith. History: The first missive was created by Fotini val\u2019Abebi in the latter days of the Imperium, just in time to assist in coordinating evacuation as the fabled civilization fell. During the Shadowed Age the Altherians kept the secret of the construct, using it among themselves. As they began to build their nation, networks of missives were established to foster communication. It is said that the skies above Khafre swarmed with them. Afterwards use of missives diminished, as Altherians sought for a time to be less ostentatious with their technological wonders, but they are still frequently used in the Shining Patrol. In addition, a number of missives were gifted to the Mother Church for use in the Blessed Lands. Abilities/Effects: Commonly dormant, the missive awakens when a divine spellcaster touches it and expends a spell slot, channeling the energy of the spell into animating the small construct. Once animated, any time within the next hour you may give the small construct a set of simple instructions and place a package in its storage container. You must send the construct to a location it has been to before and you must describe who to deliver the message or package too. The construct will do its best to fulfill your instructions, unerringly returning to you after completion. If the missive is unable to meet with your instructions, it will also return to you and tell you why it was unable to fulfill its instructions. Regardless of its success or failure once the missive returns to you it goes dormant once more. Secure Storage: A missive has a small container built into it, a few cubic inches in volume, which is able to carry a few ounces of messages or cargo, such as a potion or a scroll. More weight will prevent the construct from flying. If the missive is ever captured by a third party, it may choose to destroy any non-magical item within its compartment as a reaction. Mockingbird Collar Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement) Description: This is a braided leather choker with a mockingbird feather at its center. History: Iona of Plexus loved Florine, but Florine was married to the powerful and cruel Phocas Servius, who kept Florine imprisoned under guard. Iona crafted the mockingbird collar to allow her to imitate Phocas\u2019s bellow when she stole into Florine\u2019s room. She would then order that the guards not to disturb them in Phocas\u2019s voice. Thus, they were able to spend precious moments together, whispering words of love and planning their escape. Sadly, Phocas discovered their plans, and murdered Florine in a jealous rage. In despair Iona threw herself into the Gulf of Coryan and drowned. Her mockingbird collar later washed up on shore, where it was recovered, studied, and duplicated by others. Abilities/Effects: While this collar is worn you gain the ability to imitate the voice of anyone you have heard speaking. Tuning the collar to a particular voice requires an action. Once tuned, for the next hour, your voice sounds identically to the voice you chose to emulate. This grants you advantage on all Charisma (Performance) checks while attempting to disguise yourself as the person whose voice you are imitating. Monkey Gloves Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement) Description: These well-crafted gloves are made from spider-monkey hide. The hide is still covered in fine black hairs. The palms of the gloves are made from dark, padded leather that fits snugly to the wearer\u2019s hands. History: Vita Flavius claimed to have bought these gloves from a merchant, who had in turn bought them from natives in the Corlathian Mountains, who had in turn found them in the lost city of Mattawab. In reality, Vita, a skilled artificer, had crafted the gloves herself. However, it was her passion to discover the lost city, and selling the gloves was her best chance of financing an expedition. Few scholars of note believed her story of the origin of these items, but they were useful enough that she was able to finance her dream. The expedition, and Vita, were never heard from again. Abilities/Effects: While these gloves are worn you have a climb speed equal to your normal speed. In addition, you can use your reaction when you fall to reduce any falling damage you take by an amount equal to five times you character level. Monster Whistles Wondrous item, rarity varies Description: These items appear to be small folk charms on leather thongs or slim chains, but closer inspection reveals that they are actually whistles. History: The four spellcasters that became the Whistling Company first met in the Free City of Blackwand. They wished to become adventurers, but their lack of fighting skill concerned them. They found a solution in the market, where an Undir was\u2003 selling hand-carved whistles shaped like various creatures. Pooling their magical knowledge, the four were able to enchant these whistles into summoning charms, and for years the Whistling Company had many adventures. After the two surviving members retired they sold the whistles, which have become popular in the private garrisons of noble houses for their ability to simultaneously summon help and raise the alarm. Abilities/Effects: These whistles are small enough to fit in your pocket. You can use an action to blow one of them and cast conjure animals. The creature or creatures you summon is determined by the specific whistle. Once used, these whistles regain the ability to summon forth their bound spirits after 7 days have passed. Azure Lizard, (uncommon): This bright-blue ocarina is shaped like a lizard. When blown its sharp staccato call summons 8 giant lizards. Bird of Omens (uncommon): This short, squat flute is made from mahogany. When blown, it creates a sharp, squawking call that summons 8 swarms of ravens. Blood Wing (rare): This sinister looking charm is made of blood-red cypress wood with a long, thin proboscis that serves as a mouthpiece. When sounded, it makes a strange, echoing buzzing noise that summons 8 striges. Glistening Crawlers (uncommon): This wormwood flute is carved with coiling centipedes along its length and is lacquered to a warm color. When blown, it produces a deep, earthy tone which summons 4 swarms of insects. Grim Hounds (rare): This flute is made of ash and yew which are molded together to form the shape of a baying hound. This flute produces a mournful howl when blown, summoning 8 mastiffs. Iron Eater (rare): This iron-wood penny whistle is carved into the shape of a hump-backed quadruped with a propeller tail and long feelers. When blown, it produces an off-key sound that clashes with itself which summons 4 rust monsters. Marrow Men (rare): This macabre flute is carved from a human tibia. The bone is stained with dried blood and produces a shallow, haunting tune which summons 8 zombies. Silken Spinner (uncommon): This intricate and graceful ocarina is made from polished silkwood shaped as a spider. When blown, it resounds with a tinkling whispery tune which summons 2 giant spiders. Necklace of Beroe Wondrous item, rare Description: Seven turquoise and aquamarine plates, each engraved with breaking waves, are set into a steel and cobalt alloyed chain. Each link of the chain is shaped like the shell of a sea-creature. History: Valanos created the first necklace of Beroe in pale imitation of one of the five great elorii artifacts in Belestor. Many Berokene wore them as signs of devotion, and after the fall of Belestor and the loss of the great artifacts the necklaces continued to be worn in remembrance. The Berotar of Entaris, in particular, prize these necklaces highly. No necklace has ever been given willingly to outsiders, and most Berokene consider the wearing of these items by humans to be an affront worthy of death. Abilities/Effects: While worn underwater you can breathe normally as if you were under the effects of a water breathing spell and you gain a +1 bonus to your AC. Speak with Her Children (Requires Attunement): You can only attune to this item if you are a Berokene elorii. You can communicate with any creature native to lakes, rivers, or oceans as if you were constantly under the effects of a speak with animals spell. In addition, while in or near a body of water, you can use your action to cast conjure animals, summoning aquatic creatures only. Once you use this ability, you cannot use it again until the next dawn. Necromantic Shroud Wondrous item, legendary (requires attunement) Description: This funeral shroud is embroidered in barely visible spider silk with hundreds of tiny magical glyphs. History: Tasia val\u2019Mordane, a Coryani Nerothian, spoke passionately against the Cancerese rebellion. Despite this, she barely escaped from an angry anti-Nerothian mob that burned her home and killed her spouse and daughter. Enraged by this injustice, she made her way north to Canceri, bearing her dead child on her back. The Cancerese were loath to trust such an outspoken opponent of the Dark Triumvirate, so to prove that she had truly turned\u2003 against the Coryani she created the first necromantic shroud from the funeral wrappings of her daughter and personally presented it to the Dark Apostate. Many Cancerese temples of Neroth now have a shroud on hand, though they are considered illegal and heretical by most other nations. Abilities/Effects: When you place this shroud over a freshly deceased corpse, it rises as a ghoul under your control after 1 minute. You may control up to 5 ghouls at any one time; any additional ghouls created are not under your control. You can control ghouls raised with the shroud as if you created them with create undead but they do not count against any limits for controlling undead with that spell. The shroud is easily destroyed; it possesses AC 10 and 10 hit points. If destroyed, all ghouls it created are set free from your control. Needle of Mending Wondrous item, uncommon Description: This needle appears to be a simple copper needle with several tiny glyphs etched into it. History: Found throughout the Coryani Empire, these items are prized by surgeons, soldiers, and tailors everywhere. Originally created by clerics of Beltine for simple household tasks, the secret of their creation has spread, and they are now common household items in the richest sections of all major cities. Centurions quickly discovered how useful a Needle of Mending could be - from darning socks, to repairing armor or quickly sewing shut a comrade\u2019s wounds. As their reputation spread, so did their abundance. Now many field medics make this item a standard part of their healer\u2019s bag. Every legionnaire that can afford it owns one of these magical needles. Abilities/Effects: You may spend 1 minute working with this needle to repair any ripped or torn object made of cloth, leather, or similar substance as if you had cast the mending cantrip. You may also use the needle while taking a short rest to heal one creature of 2d8 hit points of damage. Once this ability is used, it cannot be used again until the next dawn. Nier\u2019s Heart Wondrous item, rare Description: These pins are made from a fire opal, a gem said to be the eggs of salamanders that glow with an inner fire. History: Many were surprised when Arthmoor val\u2019Virdan, rather than a more martial Nierite, was selected to be the first Dark Apostate of Canceri. Those who chose him, however, knew that his religious fervor and political acumen were what they needed. Arthmoor\u2019s religious training included divine magic, and in his younger days he had created these pins from fire opals. When he became Dark Apostate he bestowed the items as honors for those who had served Canceri loyally. During their occupation, the Swords of Nier confiscated some of these pins for their own troops, and now the pins are considered awards of honor in both militaries. Abilities/Effects: While wearing this pin, you have advantage on all saving throws against spells or effects which deal fire damage. Sword of my Lord (Requires Attunement): You may only attune to this item if you are a worshipper of Nier. While wearing this pin, you can use an action to cast either flame blade or Nier\u2019s blade, regaining the ability to do so daily at daw ii. See Chapter Nine for the new spell, Nier\u2019s Blade. Olymed\u2019s Armband of Ever-Ready Blades Wondrous item, rare Description: This armband is made from twisted strands of gold and engraved with symbols of strength and alertness. This armlet is worn around the bicep and is often kept in full view by proud dwarven warriors. Intricate golden charms hang from the armlet, up to six in total, each a minute yet perfect representation of a weapon. History: Created by the dwarven weapon master, Olymed, these bracelets are a boon to any warrior caught without a weapon or forced to leave their favorite sword at the tavern door. Olymed, a successful dwarven craftsman from Solanos Mor, became widely known for the quality of his creations sold throughout Marketplace, the large bazar situated at the foot of the mountain that houses the Solani enclave. Abilities/Effects: When worn, as an action you can transform any weapon you hold with a weight of 20 lbs. or less into a small charm which hangs upon this armband. While in this form, any ability that weapon possesses is inactive. Up to 6 weapons may be stored this way, and weapons with ammunition share a slot with their ammunition, such as a bow and a quiver of arrows. You can summon a stored weapon back to your hands as a bonus action, with ammunition appearing either on you or next to you. If the armband is targeted by a dispel magic spell, all the weapons that are charms instantly appear at your feet. If the armband is ever destroyed, roll a d4 for each weapon. On a 1 that weapon is destroyed. On any other result the weapon appears at your feet. Orb of Lore Wondrous item, very rare Description: This fist-sized sphere of dark blue crystal is highly sought after by scholars and sages. History: Allathan val\u2019Abebi was a great artificer who helped construct the flying city of Khafre. While others worked on the structure, he crafted artifacts within the city. His crowning achievement was the great orb of lore, a repository of knowledge and prophecy that, so said Allathan, would ensure the Altherians would always be the most advanced people in the world. Like Khafre itself, the orb was a symbol of Altherian hubris, and when the city crashed it shattered in an explosion that slew Allathan. Chastened by this, his apprentices created the modern orbs. Though not nearly as powerful as the original, there are many, ensuring that they will never be lost in a single disaster. Abilities/Effects: You may use this orb as a spellcasting focus when casting divination spells. The orb also has 3 charges, and regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn. If the last charge is ever used the orb cannot regain charges until left undisturbed in a library or museum for 1 day. While holding the orb, you may use an action and expend 1 or more charges to cast one of the following spells: comprehend languages (1 charge), identify (1 charge), legend lore (2 charges). Orb of Nikenes val\u2019Mehan Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement) Description: This small orb, no larger than a pebble, is made from a tiger\u2019s eye gem. History: In the late ninth century Nurion the Undying briefly reappeared from his wanderings at the Sanctorum of the Arcane in Nishanpur, of all places. He delivered the first known example of the orb, along with detailed notes on its construction. Nurion claimed that he did not invent the orb, but rather he found clues to its creation in the ruins of the tower of Nikenes val\u2019Mehan, a First Imperium mage that, it is said, had dealings with the mysterious being known only as Amanth. Nikenes was constantly trying to push the boundaries of what magic could do, and Nurion suspected that an experiment gone wrong was what ultimately destroyed his tower and killed him.

Orb of Opalescence Wondrous item, legendary (requires attunement) Description: These extremely rare black opals have only been discovered near the Sorcerer Stones in the Hinterlands. History: Who creates these orbs, or why, is not known. What is known is that the Ehtzara and the Cult of the Jackal do not look kindly upon those who remove them from the Sorcerer Stones.

Orb of the Seer Wondrous item, uncommon Description: This large crystal orb appears to have been carved with wild, twisted glyphs that glow with their own inner radiance. History: The first orb of the seer was created by Ahrizan, a celestial giant of the Tultipet clan. After crafting this orb, he saw a vision of the future, including the horrible fate of the celestial giants. He begged his clan leader to abandon their tyrannical rule over humans, and for his troubles he was declared a traitor and slain. After the curse was laid upon the dwarves, the Tultipetans remembered Ahrizan, and began to revere him as a prophet and saint. In penance, they crafted many more of the orbs and gave them to the Temple of Larissa, where these orbs are primarily found to this day. Abilities/Effects: You may use this orb as a spellcasting focus while casting any divination spell. While holding this orb, you may spend 1 minute to receive a glimpse into the future.

History: Jana Gavius, Inquisitor of the Mother Church assigned to Tralia, had settled into her assigned province well, marrying and bearing two children. Then a Cancerese heretic slipped into her village and spread the deadly disease known as infant\u2019s sleep. Jana caught the heretic soon after, but he laughed in her face. His wicked deed was done, and Jana\u2019s children were among the slain. Jana blamed herself for not discovering him sooner and left her husband to fight in the first Heretic War. To ensure she would never again be caught unawares, she plucked out her own eye and crafted the first orb of vision to replace it. It has since become a symbol of the most fanatical of the Church\u2019s inquisitors. Abilities/Effects: You may only utilize an ocular of vision if you have an empty eye socket.

The outer portion of the gauntlet is silver plated, with black chainmail lies underneath. History: Pacorus the Terrible was the most notorious of the Priest-Kings of the Auxunite Empire. It is said there was a hunger inside him, a hunger to spread fear among his subjects. At first these dark ambitions were tempered by his fellow priest-kings, but then Pacorus retreated into his lair for a year and a day, forging his gauntlet of power. When he emerged, the bejeweled gauntlet glittering on his right hand, he could no longer be opposed. The priest- kings who sought to stop him found themselves cowering before him, their bodies wracked with disease and mad cackles mixing with sobs in their throats. For ten years Pacorus spread terror and fear throughout the empire, until he was finally felled by an assassin, much to the people\u2019s relief. Abilities/Effect: This gauntlet is a magic weapon makes your unarmed strikes deal magical slashing or bludgeoning damage. The gauntlet possesses 5 charges and regains 1d4+1 expended charges daily at midnight. If you use the final charge roll a d20.

These beads are worn as either a necklace or as a wristlet.

Abilities/Effects: You can use your action to command this saddle to create a semi-real light riding horse beneath it, exactly as the phantom steed spell. The saddle only functions in this way for 12 hours each day, but that duration can be divided into 1 hour segments. Pin of Illiir\u2019s Radiance Wondrous item, uncommon Description: This pin is crafted in the shape of the sun with beams of light encircling it. History: After the Cult of the Thousand-Eyed Man massacred the populace of the city of Kofan, the fledgling Inquisition realized that it needed new strength. Before the Patriarch went into hiding he charged the priesthoods with developing more powerful magical items. The temple of Illiir answered the call with this pin, which is still prized by inquisitors in the Mother Church and Milandisian Orthodoxy. The one rule laid upon inquisitors is that these pins are only to be worn when heresy is suspected in the field, for under the pin\u2019s power even the smallest of lies told for the sake of social niceties become difficult, and wearing one in a social setting is a serious faux pas. Abilities/Effects: While this pin is worn openly, any creature that attempts to he to you must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed saving throw, that creature must tell you the truth for 1 minute. Upon a successful saving throw they become immune to the pin\u2019s effects until the next dawn.

Such a creature can be evasive in its answers as long as it remains within the boundaries of the truth. Pin of Neroth\u2019s Blessing Wondrous item, legendary (requires attunement by a worshiper ofNeroth) Description: This pin, shaped like an ankh, the holy symbol ofNeroth, and grants Neroth\u2019s blessing to the wearer. History: Many of the Nerothian necropolises of southern Canceri have areas warded against all but the undead, making them all but impenetrable fortresses of the val\u2019Mordane family. During the Heretic Wars Radegond Nordohter, a Milandisian, created five of these pins; one for herself and the others for her four companions, whom she led in a daring raid on one of the larger necropolises. She succeeded in her mission of collapsing the necropolis at the cost of her life, foiling a Cancerese push south. Her pin was found by her enemies, and later copies are now primarily found in southern Canceri. Unlike the original, however, these copies crumble to dust after removal. Abilities/Effects: When this pin is worn openly, you are considered to be undead. You gain immunity to poison damage and the poisoned condition, resistance to necrotic damage, and resistance to nonmagical bludgeoning, slashing and piercing damage from weapons that aren\u2019t silvered. You do not need to eat, sleep, or even breathe. Curse: Once attuned to this item you must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw to remove this pin. On a failed saving throw, you suffer 4 levels of exhaustion. On a successful saving throw, you suffer 2 levels of exhaustion. Once removed, the pin crumbles to dust. Pin of Sarish\u2019s Might Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement by a worshiper ofSarish)\u2003 Description: This pin is purple disk with inscribed sigils of Sarish and it protects the wearer from the touch of infernals. History: Legend has it that these pins were created by brave Sarishans who supported the First Emperor\u2019s crusade against the infernal menace. These legends are false. In actuality these pins were created by Khurshid val\u2019Mehan, a still-living traveling merchant, so that she could charge a higher price. Despite her duplicity, the pins still work as advertised and are frequently found among the brave crusaders at the Wall of the Gods, as well as among the Sarishans of the Dark Triumvirate. Abilities/Effects: When openly worn, any infernal that targets you with an attack or harmful spell must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or choose a new target for their attack or spell. An infernal that fails their saving throw is unable to directly harm or touch you for 1 minute. This effect does not protect you from area effects attacks, such as the fireball spell. Pipe of the Underworld Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement) Description: This ivory pipe is capped at either end with grimy bronze fittings. When smoking from this pipe, the grey smoke tendrils form macabre shapes of menacing spirits. History: Even before the Becherek Heresy, the Nerothians of Canceri preferred to work with undead rather than destroy them. Pratibha Lai created the first pipe of the underworld in the seventh century, giving it in secret to the temple of Neroth. With these pipes the temple was able to enchant and sway rogue undead to return to their necropolises, sparing them from destruction by the Mother Church. She was not given the gift of Neroth, though she did live long enough to see Canceri become an independent nation. After the insurrection, the Nerothians removed the veil of secrecy from her creation, and it can now be found throughout southern Canceri, and rarely in other nations. Abilities/Effects: These pipes may be used as an arcane or divine focus if you are a follower of Cadic or Neroth. When you are holding these pipes, any undead you target with enchantment spells suffer disadvantage on their saving throws to resist the effects.

These flutes are tuned to different pitches so that they harmonize with each other. History: Bedlas the Twisted, heretical bard of Erhan, created these paired flutes to help rouse the peasantry into open rebellion against the local temple of Illiir. The rebellion died before it could start, primarily because the Inquisition of the Mother Church dispatched the Legio Lex Talionis to capture and execute Bedlas for heresy. Abilities/Effects: These pipes have 10 charges and regain 1d6 + 4 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the pipes\u2019 last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, these pipes lose their magical properties until you cast 10 spell levels worth of enchantment spells into the pipes, at which point the pipes regain 1 charge and continues to regain charges as normal. While holding the pipes, you can use an action and expend 1 or more charges to cast one of the following spells, using your spell save DC: confusion (4 charges), enthrall (2 charges), and mass suggestion (6 charges). Plume of Righteous Victory Wondrous item, very rare Description: This item is a brightly colored plume fashioned from the tail of the rare kuni bird. History: Since the death of Menesis val\u2019Thnsen and the founding of the Free States of Almeric, the Sons of Righteous Fury have dedicated themselves to uniting Almeric, and thus the val\u2019Tensen family. They have not forgotten their goal of seeing a val\u2019Thnsen on the Alabaster Throne, but they recognize the unification of Almeric as a necessary first step. To this end, they have crafted plumes of righteous victory for their allies. The plumes are deliberately crafted in the Ulfilan and Milandisian style, eschewing the typical Coryani crest, as a symbol of the change they seek to bring to Onara. Abilities/Effects: While wearing a helm or hat with this plume attached, as a bonus action you can cast either righteous fury or smite infidel (save DC 13).

Most popular amongst the devotees of Larissa, Goddess of Passion, at least one of these devices can be found amongst the courtiers of the various courts of Onara. Pomanders can also be found scattered about the homes of the affluent, transforming them into a pleasing and relaxing retreat from the squalor and most importantly smell of city life. Abilities/Effects: This pomander can be attuned to any room no larger than 50 square feet. Once attuned, a creature touching the pomander may use an action to grant all creatures within the area resistance against poison damage and advantage on all saving throws to resist disease or the poisoned condition for 1 hour.

Interestingly these bowls have an additional use; they can burn away the poison from tainted food. History: Emperor Quintelus val\u2019Dellenov\u2019s third son Efrem never wanted to be a legionnaire; he wanted to be a scholar and artificer. However, his father was insistent that no son of his would \u201cspend his days locked up in a library like an Altherian\u201d, and forced him into the Legion of the Mighty Oak. Efrem despised the rough life of a legionnaire, and used his skill with artificing to create the pot of simmering so he could at least get a hot meal on cold nights, and ensure the moldy rations did not kill him. Sadly, his magic pot could not stop enemy arrows, but after his death his fellow legionnaires sold his creation at a profit. Pots of simmering are now marketed to noble households throughout Onara. Abilities/Effects: As an action you may put food or drink in this pot and have it heat up as if it were under the effects of a heat metal spell.

Raiment of Illiir Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement) Description: These pure white garments are trimmed with ermine and gold-cloth, with a golden sunburst emblazoned upon the chest. History: Dating from the Imperium, these vestments have always been worn by the high priests of Illiir while enacting their sacred rituals.

When this mask is donned, it animates into a snarling visage of horror. History: The first of these items to be studied by humans came to the Free City of Blackwand three years before the outbreak of the Coryani Civil War. Laghyphe of Pajharo, a Kio adventurer, had discovered the item in an abandoned Gar Dolem camp in the wilderness of Uggur. The mask finally laid to rest the long-standing legend that the infamous Red Howler tribe were lycanthropes who could transform themselves into wolves. Now it is believed that their fiercest warriors simply don these masks and take on bestial visages, though that is hardly less terrifying for their opponents. Abilities/Effects: While this mask is worn you possesses darkvision out to a range of 60 feet. If you already have darkvision, your range is increased by 60 feet. In addition, you can bite as an unarmed strike, dealing 1d6 piercing damage. Bestial Howl (Requires Attunement): While wearing this mask, you may howl as action to cast fear (save DC 15). Once you use this ability, you cannot use it again until the next midnight. Robe of Shadowshaping Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement) Description: This thick, black velvet robe cloaks its wearer in darkness. Under bright sunlight, the robe seems to shimmer somewhat and faint magical glyphs can be seen tracing over the surface. The lining of the robe seems to be pure shadow, and is always chilled to the touch. History: It is a sad truth that the infernal taint of the dark-kin often finds expression in acts of evil. For Mendion the Forktongue, a ninth century bard of little renown, this darkness instead found expression in somewhat self-indulgent and depressing poetry, devotion to Cadic, and fascination with the Shadow Realm. Although his tormented verse never became popular, he created the robe of Shadowshaping, which gained great renown among other followers of the Dark God. The Mother Church tried to commission Mendion as a scholar and artificer, but his heart was in his poetry, and he died penniless in Plexus. illumination for 24 continuous hours, after which it regains 1 charge.

The rope has AC 20 and 20 hit points. It regains 1 hit point every 5 minutes as long as it has at least 1 hit point. If the rope drops to 0 hit points, it is destroyed. Rope of Security Wondrous item, uncommon Description: This item appears to be a length of simple, hemp rope. History: The Hinterlands is far from safe, but there are those who must still make their way across these troubled lands. Kiul, an ascetic, suffered numerous attacks by bandits and vicious beasts as he trekked through this dangerous area. After an attack that left him gravely wounded, he was nursed back to health by a wandering Ehtzara. Taking pity on the traveler, the mystic invoked the blessings of the spirits and enchanted a piece of rope to grant travelers a safe-haven. As word of this device spread throughout the Known Lands, there was a great demand for it and eventually the Ehtzara traded these enchanted ropes to the various Yhing hir tribes, who in turn sold them to others for various favors and boons. Abilities/Effects: This rope is 60 feet long and weighs 5 pounds. If you hold one end of the rope and use an action to speak its command word, the rope surrounds a 20-foot radius area, erecting a ward that protects the area from unwanted intrusion. For the next 8 hours, this ward alerts you whenever a Tiny or larger creature touches or enters the warded area. When you set the rope, you may designate creatures that won\u2019t set off the ward. You also choose whether the ward\u2019s alert is mental or audible. A mental alarm alerts you with a ping in your mind if you are within 1 mile of the warded area. This ping awakens you if you are sleeping. An audible alarm produces the sound of a hand bell for 10 seconds within 60 feet. Once used, the rope cannot be used again until the next dawn. Saddle of Mount Mastery Wondrous item, uncommon Description: This Khur Gi style saddle is plain and functional, designed for form over function by this taciturn people. History: This saddle was first created by a Khur Gi shaman who sought to prove that his power was greater than that of the Ehtzara. To do this, he declared that he would tame a dire bat that had been terrorizing the area for years and that the Ehtzara had been unable to banish. After stalking the beast for weeks, he and a group of warriors were able to capture the creature long enough to place the saddle upon it. Miraculously, the beast became docile enough to be flown back to the heart of the Khur Gi encampment, where the shaman basked in the glory showered upon him by the tribe. Sadly, the shaman was found days later, ripped apart like an overripe fruit. The enchanted saddle that had won him such acclaim had been tossed to one side and the dire bat was gone. Wisely, the Khur Gi chieftain declared that the saddle would be used solely on natural creatures and that creatures within the supernatural realm would be best left to the Ehtzara. Abilities/Effects: This saddle may be worn by any Medium or Large mount. When this saddle is first put on a creature, they must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or become docile and well-behaved. While the mount is docile, its rider gains advantage on any Wisdom (Animal Handling) checks that relate to the mount. Each day at dawn, the mount can make a new saving throw. If the mount succeeds or if the saddle is left off the mount for more than 1 hour, the mount is free of the enchantment until the next dawn. Saddle of Security Wondrous item, very rare Description: This monogrammed saddle appears as a normal, albeit highly-decorated, military saddle. History: Created by the Pearl Maidens to protect members of their monastic order from the many predators that roam the Hinterlands, this item tends to capture more of the two\u00aclegged variety than the four-legged ones. Either way, the vermin are dealt with quickly and without mercy. Abilities/Effects: This saddle can be worn by both Medium and Large sized mounts. It is enchanted with a permanent arcanist\u2019s magic aura spell, giving it a false aura to appear nonmagical. As an action, you can command this saddle to cast the alarm spell that only affects the mount wearing it. If any creature but yourself attempts to ride the mount, the spell alerts you with an audible alarm. In addition, the saddle will cast hold person (DC 12 saving throw, no concentration needed) on whatever creature triggered the alarm. When you activate this effect, you can designate creatures that won\u2019t set off the alarm. Once you use the saddle in this way, you cannot do so again until the next dawn. Saraph\u2019s Spanning Rug Wondrous item, rare Description: This is a 5 ft. by 10 ft. wool carpet with geometrical patterns woven in blue and black upon its surface. History: The ancient Auxunite Empire was an exotic land, filled with wondrous and bizarre magical artifacts. After their expulsion from the area south of the Gods\u2019 Wall, a few of these relics were left behind and are still found by intrepid explorers and treasure hunters. In a cache beneath a dangerously tilted stone tower in the Duchy of Tralia, dozens of wool rugs were discovered, miraculously preserved as if they were weaved just the other day. Abilities/Effects: As an action you may command the rug to grow to four times its original size (20 ft. by 40 ft.) and become rigid. The rug does not attach itself to surfaces but it is strong enough to bridge gaps. While expanded, the rug can support up to 600 lbs., exceeding this maximum causes it to tear and break, dropping everything it was supporting. As an action, you may command the rug to quickly return into its original form, rolling up at your feet. Sarishan Seal Wondrous item, uncommon Description: These large stamps are forged from Sarishan steel and have a long handle. On the underside of the seal is a series of arcane symbols surrounding the holy symbol of Sarish. History: These seals are forged by Sarishan priests to seal contracts between parties, be they merchants, rulers or infernals. All signatories to the contract know that breaking the letter of the agreement carries with it dire consequences, which includes divine retribution. Those who swear by Lord Sarish\u2019s name do not do so lightly. Abilities/Effects: Worshippers of Sarish may use this seal as an arcane focus. If held while casting the Sarishan oath spell, this seal forms a magical connection between itself and the oath. A Sarishan seal be linked to a maximum of 3 independent oaths. When holding the seal, you can mentally review the oaths it is currently linked to and disconnect the seal from any or all of those oaths. If any party breaks one of the oaths a Sarishan seal is linked to, all involved parties are instantly aware of it. Additionally, while holding the seal, those cursed with the Curse of the Oathbreaker suffer disadvantage on all saving throws against any divination spell cast by you. See Chapter Nine for the new spell, Sarishan oath. Sash of Keleos Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement) Description: Four rhinestones are set into red\u00acgold plates that are attached to this sash. The sash itself is made from fiery-red silk threads, interwoven with fine gold strands. History: This item, and others of its kind, is part of a set of ancient eloran artifacts connected to the Elemental Lords. Though Keleos has not answered any prayers directed to him in centuries, items blessed by him, such as this sash, are revered by the elorii as a lasting link to their devoured god.

You also gain the ability to cast produce flame, using Charisma as your spellcasting ability. Scabbard of the Blessed Wondrous item, uncommon Description: This plain scabbard bears the holy symbol of the deity it is dedicated to embossed on its side. History: Divine artificers of the Imperium of Man sought to create ever more opulent items of power. With great pride they would bring their jewel-encrusted, gold-wrought trinkets to the Temple of the Pantheon, more for their own glory than for the glory of the gods. Then one day Akantha val\u2019Inares presented twelve simple scabbards, each unadorned save for an embroidered symbol of one of the gods of the Pantheon of Man. Some reacted with scorn, and others with fury at such a plain offering, but Eunike val\u2019Virdan stepped forward, sheathed her sword within the scabbard of Nier, and drew it forth again. The sword glowed with divine power, and Eunike boldly declared that Akantha had put all the pride of the priests to shame, for with her simple gift she had enhanced the strength of the armies of humanity. Since that time none have tried to embellish these scabbards, for their plainness is a reminder that the gods favor substance over appearance.\u2003 Abilities/Effects: If you are a worshipper of the same god that the scabbard is dedicated to you may use a bonus action to bless your blade as you draw it from the scabbard. A non-magical sword blessed in this way becomes a magic weapon and grants a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls for the next hour. Once used, you cannot use this ability again until the next dawn. Simple Gifts (Requires Attunement): You may only attune to the scabbard if you are a divine spellcaster dedicated to the same god as the scabbard. While wearing the scabbard, you may cast smite heretic, using Wisdom as your spellcasting ability. Once used, you cannot use this ability again until the next dawn. See Chapter Nine for the new spell smite heretic. Scabbard of the Elements Wondrous item, uncommon Description: These finely tooled wood and leather scabbards are always etched with patterns depicting one of the four elements: mountains for earth, rivers for water, flames for fire, and clouds for air. History: Perinia the Berokene, Vatatos the Kelekene, Terethes the Marokene, and Avarea the Osalikene were renowned in Belestor as the finest artisans of their bloodlines. Being friendly rivals, they organized : competition between them to each design a beautiful, yet functional, scabbard. Soon their contest became something else entirely, as the four masters pushed, critiqued, and advised each other to greater heights of skill. Crowds gathered. All sensed that something marvelous was in the making. And then the Elemental Lords, in all their glory, appeared before them. They declared the work a symbol of the strength of the bloodlines when they worked together, and they imbued not only the originals, but all future scabbards made in the same manner with a breath of their power. Even today some few artisans still toil endlessly to recreate the original masterworks. Abilities/Effects: Each of these scabbards is attuned to an element: earth, air, fire, or water. Any time you draw a non-magical blade from one of these scabbards, as a bonus action you may infuse it with elemental power. This makes the sword a magic weapon that grants you a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls and deals an additional 1d4 damage of the appropriate elemental type (acid for earth, cold for water, thunder for air, fire for fire) for the next hour. Once used this ability cannot be used again until the next dawn. Strength of the Bloodlines (Requires Attunement): You can only become attuned to one of these scabbards if you are an elorii whose bloodline matches the element of the scabbard.

Scarab of the Bronze Catacombs Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement) Description: These scarabs appear as small, stylized beetles crafted from bronze and set with small fragments of jet and black opals. History: These insidious scarabs were invented by the twisted mind of one of the ancient Necromancer Lords ofMyrantis, Lord Neferka Siptah. Lord Siptah was an adherent of the god Tzizhet, the Many Limbed, making frequent sacrifices to this abomination.

The barbs of the thorns stick and jab the wearer\u2019s neck, keeping them awake. The longer you wear this necklace, the more unhinged you become due to lack o| sleep. History: The Temple of Larissa keeps the origin of these necklaces a secret, for they were created by the infamous Iduma val\u2019Sheem, better known for defecting to and later leading the cult of the Lady of Thorns. While these necklaces are simply too useful to many adventurers and to the Coryani legions to declare them heretical, the Larissans fear the backlash should the truth of their creation be known. Meanwhile Iduma made many of these necklaces for the cult after his defection, the cult now uses them as part of their recruitment techniques, driving initiates mad from lack of sleep and then brainwashing them. Abilities/Effects: While worn, you cannot fall asleep under any means and are immune to any effect that would cause you to fall asleep. You do not gain any levels of exhaustion from this lack of sleep. If you wear this necklace for more than 3 days, you have disadvantage on all Intelligence and Wisdom checks.

Serpent Boots Wondrous item, uncommon or rare Description: These knee-boots are made from the hide of a giant constrictor snake and shod at the heel and toe with copper. The toe is ornamented to appear as a viper\u2019s mouth. History: Ownership of these boots is considered a badge of honor for those serving in the Shining Patrol. Seeing a pair on a patrolman means that they engaged and killed a ssanu during their tour of duty. The hide of the ssanu is then taken to an Altherian mage-artificer, who uses it to create a pair of serpent boots. Since the members of the Shining Patrol come from all over the continent, these boots can be found across Onara, usually on the feet of retired members of the Patrol. Abilities/Effects: While worn you may use a bonus action to disguise your tracks as the tracks of a snake for up to 1 hour. This hour does not need to be continuous, and may be deactivated as a bonus action.

History: The first of these shawls was created in the region that eventually became Salantis, and used fish scales instead of crystals to create the shimmering effects. Egica, the shawl\u2019s creator, led his people in worshiping an unnamed god of sea and stars. For some time, his magical power allowed his people to flourish, but as he grew older his mind sank into madness. Eventually his own people turned on him, slaying him and delivering his shawl to the priests of the gods of the Pantheon of Man. It is rarely used by trained mages, but hedge mages and other isolated spellcasters often favor its power. Abilities/Effects: While wearing this shawl, you can use it as a spellcasting focus which grants you a +1 bonus on spell attack rolls Shroud of the Initiate Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement) Description: This hood, used during certain ceremonies, is made from black cloth that covers the head and face. A fine gold mesh covers the eyes, but still allows one to see clearly. Upon the forehead is a stylized eye embroidered with gold thread. History: This rare item is one of a handful that has some sort of eye motif emblazoned upon it. The eye has nothing to do with the ability of the item, nor is it a crafter\u2019s mark, leading many to be perplexed by its prominent placement. Among val\u2019Abebi scholars, there is a heated debate as to whether an as yet unknown group or organization was, or still is, secretly manipulating the nations and people of the Known Lands. Taken separately, these relics may point to nothing, but other eye symbols found in strange doorways and ancient passages, as well as complete passages excised from tomes with clear precision, cause some to wonder. Abilities/Effects: While worn you cannot be the target of a divination spell or perceived by magical scrying sensors. As an action, you can use the hood to change the color of your skin, hair and clothing, granting you advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made to hide or Charisma (Deception) checks to disguise yourself for up to 1 minute. After using this ability, you cannot use it again until you complete a short rest.\u2003 Skeleton Key Wondrous item, uncommon Description: A Skeleton Key appears to be a sturdy steel key three inches in length. It has many strange and twisted prongs jutting from the shaft at weird angles and the head of the key is carved to look like a grinning human skull. History: Hundreds of these items have been found throughout Onara but they all owe their origin to the devious and crafty mind of Dellius val\u2019Borda. A rogue and a liar, Dellius hailed from the city of Plexus. He plied his trade as a seedy merchant, sailing the waters of the Corvis River looking for salvageable cargo. It is rumored that not all of the ships Dellius and his crew salvaged had sunk before he got there. He had a knack of stumbling across the worst wrecks as there were never any survivors. Dellius had a minor mage as a crewman and it was this unnamed cutthroat who enchanted the first skeleton key. Dellius convinced his crewmate to craft such an item so they could safely and quickly open the many locked chests and boxed recovered from their salvage operations.

The sphere is extremely heavy for its size and is comparable to holding a piece of lead of the same volume. History: Developed by the formidable secret society known as the Brotherhood of Man, these fervent supremacists feel that the dilution of the human blood line, as exemplified by the dark kin, gnomes and vals, need to be purged so that humanity can remain pure and untainted. To this end, this sphere was created to track down and identify disguised dark kin and prune that branch of humanity\u2019s family tree. Abilities/Effects: This sphere may be used as an arcane focus.

History: This simple, but useful, item has been duplicated the world over. Believed to have been developed by enterprising rogues, the spiderhook can be found for sale on the black market in most major cities. Interestingly, this item is also utilized by the armies of most nations and issued to scouts patrolling areas with steep or rugged terrain.

Since the fall of that empire of antiquity, many have attempted to duplicate their abilities, but have failed. Due to their almost indestructible nature, the standards are found buried beneath battlefields, in tombs and the various ruins that dot the continent. All legion standards are 10-foot tall poles with a horizontal crossbar where the standard is suspended. These standards are held in such esteem, that, almost since the founding of the Coryani Empire, anyone who discovers one and assembles one thousand men may present themselves at the gates of Grand Coryan and be declared a legion of the empire.

The Dolphin Banner of Naeraanth Description: This banner has a blue field and is emblazoned with three golden dolphins. History: Though this banner was once the standard for a Yarricite legion, its names and accomplishments are lost and unrecorded. The standard was washed ashore near the city of Naeraanth after an underwater tremor caused a small tidal wave that flooded the area. It was given to Prince Dolfgar val\u2019Ossan of Naeraanth, founder of the Milandisian League, who believed that no army could be defeated while in possession of the standard. History proved that conceit true, though many doubt that the banner was the reason for his military successes. After the interregnum, the val\u2019Ossan kings of Milandir created an elite force of knights sworn directly to the preservation of val\u2019Ossan line. The banner was placed in the care of these noble men, who, due to its emblems, became known as the Dolphin Guard.

The banner itself smolders, smoking slightly. History: From records uncovered by the Followers of the Azure Way, the Legion of the Black Sun was the most feared legion of the Imperium, due perhaps to its taking of the gods Nier and Neroth as its patron deities. Fragments\u2003 of scrolls tell of their heroism during the War of the Three Empires, but beyond that, very little is known of this legion. Millennia later, the Black Sun standard was rediscovered by a former legionnaire, but due to a rebellion led by Nierites, Sarishans and Nerothians, the emperor disbanded the assembled men and burned the hapless discoverer of the standard alive. The two gods were displeased by the disrespect shown by the emperor and raised the moldering corpses of the original legionnaires of the Black Sun. These events so shocked the emperor, that he ordered the standard be locked deep within the vaults beneath the imperial palace. Abilities/Effects: While carrying this standard, when a living humanoid dies within 60 feet of you, you may use a reaction to animate it as a skeleton under your control.

In the passes leading up to the gates, the valiant legionnaires held against the tides of Khitani invaders. After days of unending battle, General Idan val\u2019Borda, the last commander of the legion, had little hope for reinforcements. He handed the standard to a young herald, and while calling out For Duty and Honor he personally led the charge against the Khitani. The weakened Khitani forces were routed, but the legion was destroyed.

When cast using the standard, each of these spells is altered so that they can affect up to 1,000 people within 2,000 feet and last for 8 hours.

The words Ultioneus Illiir are emblazoned beneath in gold letters, which translates to The Vengeance of Illiir. History: Hailed as one of the more prestigious legions during the age of the Imperium, the Legio Lex Talionis was one of the first dozen legions reconstituted under the First Emperor, just prior to the founding of the Coryani Empire. Always a pious Illiirite legion, in the modern era, it became so orthodox in its interpretation of scripture that it eventually became the military arm of the Inquisition, hunting heretical cults and infernal worshippers. The standard is only brought from its place of honor during times of war and crisis.

Pieces of star iron can be found here in relative abundance, where they are collected by the native tribesmen. With these slivers of star iron, the dwarven craftsmen of Nol Dappa create starfire pendants. Forged in the deepest volcanic fissures beneath the city of Erduk, the pendants absorb the very heat around them. Each pendant is enchanted by a dwarven priest of Nier and provides resistance against heat and fire. The Nol Dappan dwarves are loathe to use such items, as it abates their suffering from the tremendous heat hey live under, but grudgingly use them if they must endure the suicidal levels of heat and flame in the bowels of the volcano they call home.

In a rare show of cooperation, the two societies pooled their resources to tackle the problem.

Titan-Bone Altar Wondrous item, legendary (requires attunement to a location [room]) Description: This large, menacing looking altar is made entirely of bone. History: Far out in the depths of the Hinterlands lies a blasted wasteland known as the Graveyard of the Titans. Here, gigantic bones of long dead creatures rise out of the dried mud and windblown silt, silhouetted against the blaring noonday sun, silent sentinels of a forgotten age. Foul creatures of all types inhabit this region, and only the most heavily armed and well-supplied explorers dare to cross this region. One of the strangest inhabitants of this land is Vehok val\u2019Mordane, otherwise known as the Bone Mage. It is believed that Vehok is a necromancer from Canceri that accompanied an ill-fated expedition to the Ghost Jackal Cairns. The Bone Mage resides inside a tower made from the titanic bones of some ancient behemoth, and uses the native Hua\u2019gi goblins as slaves, or worse. In a small chamber atop his rib-cone tower sits a strange structure representing the pinnacle of the Bone Mage\u2019s power. In the center of the room lies an altar, built from the bones of men and ancient creatures. The claws of some huge behemoth form posts in the corners of the altar to which captives or corpses can be tied spread eagle. Adorned with skulls of hyena men, harpies, and other humanoids, the entire scene proves to be a macabre spectacle. The true terror of this device comes into focus on the dark moonless nights that sometimes settle over the wasteland. On those nights, the Bone Mage lays a fresh corpse upon the altar and performs profane rites. At midnight, the corpse rises, animated in a mockery of life, to serve its new master in death. Abilities/Effects: This altar can be attuned to any room 100 square feet or less. The ritual to attune the altar requires the sacrifice of 4 sentient creatures which become zombies. These zombies remain near the altar at all times and attack anyone who tries to destroy it. Once attuned, placing a freshly deceased creature on the altar during a moonless night causes the corpse to raise as a zombie. Placing a freshly deceased creature upon the altar and burning 200 gp worth of incense causes the corpse to rise as a ghoul. Undead created by the altar cannot be controlled by the process described below. The zombies created when the altar was attuned to its location can never be controlled. Any undead which move farther than 1 mile from the altar are destroyed.\u2003 As an action, a creature can touch the altar and expend a spell slot. Expending a 5 th level spell slot or lower lets the creature assert control over undead created with the altar as if casting animate dead at a spell level equal to the slot level expended. Expending a 9 th level spell slot or lower lets the creature assert control over undead created with the altar as if casting create undead at a spell level equal to the slot level expended. Any undead with a CR 1 or higher that come within 1 mile of the altar must make a DC 18 Charisma saving throw or fall under the control of the altar. Those that make their save constantly feel a \u201cpull\u201d to the altar\u2019s location and may seek it out but are not under its control. The titan-bone altar is 10 feet long by 8 feet wide and 3 feet high, and weighs 900 lbs. It has AC 15 and 100 hit points. If destroyed, all undead created by the altar are released from its control. The altar then reforms 100 days later in a random uninhabited location on the same plane. See Location Attunement Sidebar, pg. 103. Toga of Office Wondrous item, uncommon Description: This pristine white toga has a single deep green bar as trim, denoting its wearer as a member of one of Coryan\u2019s leading families. History: Milo Corvanus was elevated to patrician of the fledgling Coryani Empire by the First Emperor himself before the battle of Hope\u2019s End. His son Linus, was among the first generation born with no knowledge of the Time of Terror. Unlike his father, he rankled at his green-trimmed toga setting him apart from the gold-trimmed togas of the val. To compensate for this, he crafted the first toga of office. While many of the older generation found this a sign of vulgarity and ingratitude, many of his generation, and subsequent generations, had similar togas crafted. The use of such a toga is considered scandalous if discovered, but is barely tolerated among humans. Val, however, are expected to get by on skill alone. After all, they are the Chosen of the Gods. Abilities/Effects: While worn you have advantage on Charisma (Persuasion) checks. As a bonus action, you may force a creature who can hear and see you within 20 feet to make a DC 16 Charisma saving throw. On a failed save they suffer disadvantage on all Charisma (Persuasion) checks for 1 minute. On a successful save your opponent feels as if they were intimidated, but nothing else. Once you use this ability you cannot use it again until you complete a short rest. Troll\u2019s Lament Wondrous item (gauntlet), rare Description: Fashioned from finely tooled leather, dyed a deep crimson red, and affixed with hardened obsidian spikes, this spiked gauntlet strikes fear into the heart of trolls. History: Gelvira was one of many Nol Dappan followers of the Sword of the Heavens after his reemergence, but his disappearance in the Blessed Lands left her confused and without a purpose. Partially to follow in his footsteps, and partially to seek the will of Nier, Gelvira took the path of the pilgrim. In the Corlathian Mountains her band of faithful were assaulted by Singarthan trolls, who cornered them within caves. With few tools at her disposal, Gelvira was nonetheless able to create gauntlets enchanted with fire, and held off the trolls until the pilgrims were rescued by the Soldier Saints of Dagha. Feeling the touch of purpose in her defense of others, Gelvira crafted troll\u2019s lament, building on the makeshift gauntlets that had saved her life. She has since joined the Soldier Saints, and trolls seeking to prey on pilgrims have learned to fear her flames. Abilities/Effects: While wearing this gauntlet you gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls with your unarmed strikes, which are considered magical weapons. As a bonus action, you can enshroud your gauntlet in magical flames, making your unarmed strikes deal an additional 1d4 fire damage. These flames may be used to set flammable objects alight, and shed bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet beyond that. You may extinguish these flames as a bonus action. Bolts of Flame (Requires Attunement): While wearing this gauntlet you can cast fire bolt, using Constitution as your spellcasting ability. Urn of Fool\u2019s Booty Wondrous item, very rare Description: This beautiful ceramic vase, crafted by less than honorable illusionists, is illegal in most of the Known Lands. They bear a glamour inside them that makes coins, gems or jewelry placed inside to appear more valuable. History: It is a sad fact that not everyone opposed the Infernals during the Time of Terror. One merchant doing business in the trading hub of the Plexus was swayed by promises of riches into a number of demonic pacts. This urn was the result of one such deal, and made him a very rich man, at least until he was murdered by a customer angered by his no-refund policy. The fact that these items are created even today via infernal pact is not widely known, or else they would be considered heretical, rather than merely illegal. Abilities/Effects: While this urn is held you may use an action to place up to 500 gp worth of jewelry, gems, or coins within it. For 1 hour, all items placed into the urn appear to be more valuable, doubling their worth. If a creature examines an item from the urn and succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence saving throw they can see through the urn\u2019s illusion. All items placed in the urn revert to their normal appearance after 12 hours. Once used, the urn loses its magical properties until 7 days have passed.\u2003 Valor Guards Wondrous item, uncommon Description: Decorated with carved images of holy champions, and other righteous warriors, these bracers bolster their wearer and inspire them to greater acts of bravery and valor. History: Galaros Fen was raised in the elemental traditions of Lhyllifel, and even given an elorii name by his Undir parents. But when beasts attacked his caravan it was not the Elementalists who saved him, but a band of adventuring holy champions of the Mother Church. In them Galaros found a sense of purpose he had lacked. He converted, and in tribute to the brave adventurers who had saved him he made the first valor guards, decorated with their battle against the beasts. Later versions of these items would depict other scenes, but always prominently featuring the holy champions of the Mother Church. Abilities/Effects: While these bracers are worn any time you are targeted by a spell or effect which imposes the frightened condition you may use a reaction to gain advantage on a saving throw against the spell or effect. Veil of the Silt Sea Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement) Description: Created from the wing membranes of Silt Drakes, these light tan veils protect the wearer\u2019s face from the harsh winds and blowing sands of the Great Silt Sea. History: In the northern portion of the Hinterlands, only the bravest and strongest of the Yhing hir tribesman dare to travel. Here, demons still prowl, the immortal Hyena Queen holds sway, and this blasted region holds instant death for all but the wariest. It is in these regions that Ehtzara craft special veils to aid tribesmen who must venture across this barren landscape. Abilities/Effects: While you wear this veil you are unaffected by natural environmental hazards that exist in the desert, such as quicksand and silt-traps, and are have a permanent pass without trace effect while in a dessert. Vestment of the Defender Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement) Description: These priestly robes are made of coarse material more suited to war than the temple. History: These vestments were created by Hermine Althaus for the Hurrianites who served Overprince Walport val\u2019Holryn in battle against the infernal horde during the Time of Terror. These Hurrianites gained great renown as defenders of innocents during the First Crusade, and the infernals tried many times to find and slay Hermine, or to discover the secret of crafting corrupted vestments CURSGD Items Boots of the Far -Traveled Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement) Description: These boots appear to be old, well-worn boots and bear the holy symbol of Anshar, Goddess of Travelers. History: Life in the gnome slums outside Tir Betoq was hard for Sava. When a wandering priest of Anshar passed through, she begged to accompany him. He agreed, and took her to his small chapel in the Western Lands. Most Ansharans protect the downtrodden, but this priest was corrupt and treated the poor gnome as a slave. With nowhere else to turn, she swore vengeance. Her twisted body made physical revenge unlikely, but her mind was sharp, and she turned it toward magic. She created these boots, knowing they would be stolen by the cruel priest. She began leaving bait outside the chapel, drawing wild beasts. It was only a matter of time before the priest was attacked and sought to use her boots to escape. Then Sava had her revenge. Curse: This item is cursed, a fact that is revealed only when an identify spell is cast on the item or you attune to it. Until they are worn and first used, they will identify as boots of speed. However, the first time they are used they bind themselves to the wearer and cannot be removed. So long as these boots are worn, they halve the wearer\u2019s walking speed and prevent the wearer from running. Boots of the Toad Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement) Description: These boots are usually fashioned from leather and sport a green color with splotches of black-speckled yellow and brown. These boots are typically only made for gnomes, although in rare cases a gnome will make a pair of these for a true friend. Of course, they have also been known to create pairs of these boots when they are short on cash, selling them to anyone who will buy them. History: Liginaosh, a brilliant but spurned gnome, grew tired of being ridiculed and chased out of taverns when he politely asked for food. After a particularly brutal beating at one inn, he invented a device to help him steal the food that he was being denied. The result of his tireless efforts, and insatiable appetite, are the boots of the toad. Abilities/Effects: While you wear these boots your jumping distance is doubled and you have a climb speed equal to your regular speed. Curse: This item is cursed, a fact that is revealed only when an identify spell is cast on the item or you attune to it. Once you become attuned to these boots, over the next few days your voice changes into an annoying croak, you skin takes on a greenish tinge and you start to grow warts. Unless you are a gnome, you have disadvantage on all Charisma checks. You cannot remove these boots or end your attunement to them until affected by remove curse. If these boots are removed, the changes to your body are slow to fade, requiring the passage of a month before your skin and voice return to normal. Fangs of the Night Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement) Description: This necklace appears as a mismatched set of teeth on a leather thong. History: The origins of the first of these malicious items is believed to be a strange cult of feral humans living in the wilds of Uggur, a vast and trackless wasteland filled with savages and beasts. The little that is known of their origins, mainly from the carvings upon the fangs, points towards the Seekers of the Waxing Moon, a sect devoted to some dark and hoary god. A number of these items first appeared on a caravan from Llyllifel, traveling throughout the League of Princes. Abilities/Effects: While wearing this necklace you have darkvision out to a range of 60 feet and have advantage on attack rolls, saving throws and checks at night.

You cannot inflict lycanthropy on a creature when you are transformed by the necklace. You cannot remove the necklace or end your attunement to it unless you are affected by remove curse or dispel evil and good. Locker of the Lost Mariner Wondrous item, legendary (requires attunement to a location [ship]) Description: This large, waterlogged sea chest is bound in tarnished brass and smells of brine and rot. History: When the Yarricite priests of Naeraanth went to the newly conquered province of Salantis to confront the Yarric Heresy they did not do so naively. They brought a newly enchanted Yarricite item, a sea chest that could produce a fog bank. This would disorient any peasant resistance while the inquisitors took whatever steps were necessary. When they were later attacked by abominable forces, they sought to use the chest to escape. They failed. The next morning revealed that whatever forces had attacked them had transfigured the chest into a waterlogged and rotting thing, and to the horror of the returning inquisitors those who had been left dead in its presence rose the next night. The chest was swiftly destroyed. Since that time, however, similar chests have appeared, always near the sea. Abilities/Effects: This chest can be attuned to any ship with at least two masts. It is secured by an arcane lock spell which locks and unlocks at the command of the ship\u2019s captain. The chest\u2019s other powers only function with the lid open. These chests possess 3 charges which may be expended to produce the effects below. The chest regains 1d3 expended charges daily at midnight. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a roll of 1, the chest loses all magical properties until submerged in a natural body of water for 1 day, after which it regains 1 charge. Sudden Fog Bank: As an action the ship\u2019s captain may touch this chest and expend 1 of its charges to cast fog cloud, centered on the chest, with an extended radius of 100 feet.

These undead remain and serve you faithfully until 1 hour at which point they dissipate into mist and salt water. Curse: This item is cursed, a fact that is revealed only when an identify spell is cast on the item or you attune to it. All creatures that die within 30 feet of the chest rise the following night as zombies unless their corpse is burned. These zombies are not under your control. See Location Attunement Sidebar, pg. 103. Ordainer Circlet Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement) Description: These plain circlets are slim and easily concealed. History: The notorious Retsev Rah, of the Harvesters, traveled Onara for many years disguised as a merchant and selling magical items, including circlets said to grant the power of the dreaded Ordainers. These items were linked to Ymandragore, and allowed the Harvesters to compromise many of the Sanctorum of the Arcane and kidnap numerous mages. Once his true identity was known, any remaining circlets were carefully examined, and duplicates without the Ymandragoran link were made by the militant Hawks of the Sanctorum. But Retsev was a cunning artificer and carefully embedded curses within his work, so that those mages that sought to use the circlets against the Ordainers soon found themselves vulnerable to their greatest foes. Abilities/Effects: As long as this circlet is worn, as an action you may cast detect magic. These circlets possess 3 charges which may be expended for the abilities below.

You may not remove this item or stop being attuned to it unless you are affected by remove curse. While wearing this circlet, you have disadvantage on all saving throws to resist any divination spell cast by a Harvester of Ymandragore. See Chapter Nine for the new spell, arcane sight. Slave Bracelets of Larissa Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement) Description: Crafted from silver-plated steel cuffs, these bracelets are both decorative and functional. Attached to each bracelet is a single ring, bound to it by steel chains. History: Pomona Fusia was married to a beast of a man, yet for the sake of her family she endured his cruelties for as long as she was able. Finally, she threw herself on the mercy of the Temple of Larissa, who saw her bruises and offered her sanctuary, but she hesitated. Her family was dependent on her husband\u2019s good will for their survival, and she could not leave him. Her husband was a regular visitor to the Larissan brothels, and this granted another opportunity. Rousanak val\u2019Sheem, artificer of the temple, crafted this bracelet, and arranged for the val\u2019Assante\u2019s favorite brothel girl to gift it to him. Soon he found himself unable to resist serving his wife in all things, though Pomona treated him far better than he had treated her.

Tabard of the Reluctant Warrior Wondrous item, very rare Description: This cotton tabard is embroidered with crossed arcs of lightning on the front of it. History: This tabard was commissioned by Duke Baldawin val\u2019Tensen, second Duke of Moratavia, for his Hurrianic troops. The Duke\u2019s artificers lamented that they were unable to weave together the enchantments requested without creating the curse as a side-effect, but the Duke was untroubled, boldly proclaiming that the warriors of Hurrian would never refuse those in need. Soon, however, he realized that in battle one had to make difficult choices, sacrificing a few to save many more, and that these strategies weakened those men gifted with the tabard, including the Duke himself. Since that time the tabard has been retired from regular service, and now they are only worn by the most devout Hurrianites. Abilities/Effects: While worn, and only when acting in the direct defense of those who cannot defend themselves, you may use an action to cast shield of faith. Once this ability is used it cannot be called upon again until the next dawn. The Strong Arm of Hurrian (Requires Attunement): You must be a vaPTensen to attune to this item.

RODS Archaeologists Rod Rod, very rare (optional attunement) Description: This silvery, foot long rod is unadorned but for series of runes etched in a spiral pattern down its length. It is topped by a triangular head, leading some to believe it was created by Sarishans. History: This rod was created by an Altherian secret society, the Seekers of Forbidden Lore, to expedite their exploration of the ancient, forbidden ruins of the Tenecian civilization. The Council of Wisdom, which governs the Republic of Altheria, has declared exploration of that ruined capital city prohibited unless sanctioned and accompanied by an authorized scholar. This led to a scarcity of historians with knowledge of that era. Though never proven, many attribute the disappearance of historians and other scholars throughout the Known Lands to the Seekers of Forbidden Lore, who somehow drained their accumulated knowledge and placed it into these rods. Abilities/Effects: This rod may be used either attuned or unattuned. If not attuned, while held you gain advantage on all Intelligence (History) checks related to architecture, stonework, and masonry. You also instinctively know which direction is north. If attuned to this item, in addition to the previous benefits you are considered to be proficient in the Fiistory skill as long as this rod is on your person. Imperial Rod of Judgment Rod, very rare (requires attunement) Description: This beautiful rod is forged from solid steel and inlayed with gold and platinum and shaped like a Warhammer. History: Crafted by the dwarves of Solanos Mor and Encali as a gift to Emperor Cunius val\u2019Assante upon his coronation, this rod is modeled after the Rod of Judgements wielded by the leaders of the Celestial Giants before the Curse. They were then duplicated and given to Imperial Magistrates, as well as certain High Inquisitors, as instruments of office. Abilities/Effects: This rod\u2019s construction and weight allows it to be used as a magical warhammer in combat. Additionally, while holding this rod you can use your action to cast the following spells: detect evil and good, detect thoughts Rod of the Reaper Rod, legendary (requires attunement by a spellcaster) Description: This elaborately carved, two-and-a-half-foot long rod of mahogany, bound with black iron bands topped with a mummified hand. History: It is perhaps not surprising that this rod was created in Ventaka, but despite what many might think it was not designed to be a necrotic weapon. Bala val\u2019Mordane intended to enchant the mummified hand with the ability to make another invisible. Bala, however, was cruel to her apprentice Chetana, and in retaliation the apprentice sabotaged the master\u2019s artifact. To Bala\u2019s horror, the demonstration of the rod slew the val\u2019Mordane noble she had intended to vanish. Fler neck was saved, however, when the noble arose as a zombie. The undead patriarchs of the val\u2019Mordane family were intrigued by the possibilities of such a weapon, and gave Bala high honor and an order for a dozen more. Abilities/Effects: You may wield this rod as a magic mace which deals 2d8 necrotic damage upon a successful hit against a living creature, in addition to its normal damage. Additionally, upon a successful hit you may use a reaction to send a surge of necrotic energy though the target\u2019s body, forcing them to make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or suffer an additional 7d8+30 points of necrotic damage, or half as much on a successful saving throw. Once this ability is used it may not be called upon again until after the next midnight. Lastly, if you successfully kill a living humanoid with this ability, they rise on the following turn as a zombie under your control for as long as you are attuned to the rod. You may only possess a single zombie at a time, and creating a new zombie destroys your previous zombie. Rod of the Sky Kings Rod, very rare (requires attunement) Description: These rods are made of an unusual silver and adamantium alloy, 2 feet long with numerous jeweled studs along its length and capped by stylized bird wings. History: On the cliffs of Ulfila there dwells a sect of Saluwean druids. Little greenery grows among the rocks, but these men honor and emulate the fauna of the cliffs, particularly the great birds. Tomas Ramunas, archdruid of the sect in the eighth century, lived without food or water for three days on the rock face of the largest cliff, exposed to the elements, seeking guidance from Saluwe. After he had recovered, he threw himself into the creation of this rod. It has been handed down by the druids ever since, and is used to initiate new members by having them live among the birds for three days, in honor of Tomas.

STAFFS Ansharan Pilgrim\u2019s Staff Staff, very rare (requires attunement by a divine spellcaster of Anshar) Description: This humble pilgrim\u2019s staff of gnarled oak with a crook, and shod with bronze, bears the holy symbol of Anshar carved upon its surface. History: Crafted by the wandering Ansharan mystic, Tholosus val\u2019Inares, as he searched for the fabled Vault of Stars. Since Ansharan Gates must be travelled through once so that it may be accessed again, the Ansharans methodically search the continent for lost Portals. Tholosus believed that the Vault of Stars not only contained a map of every active Ansharan Gate, but could be used to travel to anyone of them at will, without previously attuning oneself to them. Sadly, though he discovered over a dozen of previously unknown Portals, Tholosus died before completing his self-appointed quest. As his health was failing, he instructed his small cadre of ascetic priests to craft staves like his, so that they might complete his quest. To date, the existence and location of the Vault of Stars remains a mystery. Abilities/Effects: This staff can be wielded as a magic quarterstaff that grants a +1 bonus to both attack and damage rolls. While held, your walking speed is increased by 5 feet, and when brought within 100 feet of a Portal of Anshar it begins to hum, growing louder as you approach the portal. This effect may be silenced with a simple act of will. This staff possesses 10 charges and regains 1d6+ 4 expended charges daily at dawn. If you ever expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the staff retains its +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls but loses all other properties until it is carried through an activated Portal of Anshar, after which it regains 1d4 charges.

Beroe\u2019s Staff of the Deep Staff very rare (requires attunement by Berokene elorii or divine caster of Yarns) Description: These staves are typically carved from the flotsam of wrecked vessels with frolicking marine animals along its length and set with numerous shells and pieces of colorful coral. History: Among the elorii there are none so attuned to water as the Berokene, and among the Berokene there are no mariners so skilled as the Berotar of Entaris. It was soon after the founding of this order that the Berotar were sorely tested, by the sahuagin and their Ssethregoran allies. Despite their skill, the Berotar suffered greatly in the first assault. Then Issalas, captain of the Lanthras, took the wreckage of her once mighty vessel and crafted the first staff of the deep. Raising it aloft and summoning water elementals to her side, Issalas led a renewed attack against the vile creatures. The Berotar found victory that day, and the staff of the deep was handed down from captain to captain ever since. Abilities/Effects: This staff can be wielded as a magic quarterstaff that grants a +1 bonus to both attack and damage rolls. This staff possesses 10 charges and regains 1d8+2 expended charges daily at dawn. If you ever expend the last charge, roll a d20.

Cadic\u2019s Staff of Night Staff very rare (requires attunement) Description: At first glance, this staff appears to be made of ebony wood, but upon closer inspection, the staff is constantly shifting with swirls and eddies, as if a sea of blackness is contained within the staff. History: None now speak of Priska the Shadowed, Twilight Warrior of the Imperium. Her name has been struck from the ranks of that order, and her theories on the Realm of Shadow are reviled as heresy. Yet her experiments produced results, including these staves, her greatest creation. It is said that in the end all color had drained from Priska. She was slain by her fellow Twilight Warriors after she joined with the creatures of shadow, and sought to lead them in vengeance against her brethren. The staves were locked up, part of her forbidden research, until the fall of the Imperium. Then they were lost, only to be rediscovered in the third century. Few suspect that the rediscovered staves are Priska\u2019s heretical creations. Abilities/Effects: This staff can be wielded as a magic quarterstaff that grants a +1 bonus to both attack and damage rolls. Additionally, this staff possesses 10 charges for the following properties: As Formless as Shadow: As an action you may use 1 charge to cause the staff to dissipate into strands of shadow, reforming into a set of thieves\u2019 tools or a string CEDRICK VAL\u2019BORDA OPENS A RIFT IN THE REALM OF SHADOW WITH CADIC\u2019S STAFF OF NICHT instrument of dark rosewood.

To their leader, the Ujch\u2019ki, the sentinel staff was given.

Rumors told by woodsmen and rangers told of the group summoning and cavorting with Infernals. Priests of Sarish led an \u201cinvestigation\u201d that assaulted and demolished the village. Mizra was captured and the other members were made to denounce her before being executed. The priests confiscated all their records to prevent the resurrection of the cult. To this day, contradictory rumors say that Mizra and his followers were either worshipping a fallen Valinor or paying legitimate respect to Sarish with an emphasis upon His feline followers.

Before it could be returned, however, the warrior who held it was ambushed by Ssethregorans, and the staff was lost.

Staff of Deadly Wards Staff very rare (requires attunement by a spellcaster) Description: Crafted from bamboo imported from the distant Khitani Empire, this staff appears segmented, with sigils carved into the space between the natural ridges of the wood. History: Li Meirong of the Khitani Empire began her pilgrimage to the Blessed Lands some years after the second Coryani-Khitani war. A sorceress of no small skill, when the Soldier Saints of Dagha offered her protection she scoffed at them, for they had no Khitani in their company. She showed them this staff, which she had crafted herself in her homeland, and declared that this alone would be sufficient to protect her. It is true that the staff helped her escape many deadly predicaments, but the dangers of the Blessed Lands eventually led to her end.

There are no engravings in the ivory, but anyone staring into the gleaming ivory will see movement of tiny figures just beneath the surface. History: These staves befuddle scholars with contradictions. They were certainly the work of Horatiu Dragosi, who crafted the first such staff in the tenth century. However, they are mentioned in tremendous detail in the play \u201cDreams of Kla Myrtha,\u201d which was written two hundred years prior for the Theater of the Umbral Mask in Censure. These staves travel freely into Dreamtime, yet shamans who have studied them conclude that they have no connection with that realm. Those who stare at the staff see figures beneath the surface, yet it is clearly solid horn and ivory. House Dragosi not only refuses to divulge the secrets of the staves, but refuses to acknowledge there are secrets, insisting that those who point out the contradictions are merely suffering from a lack of sleep. Abilities/Effects: This staff can be wielded as a magic quarterstaff that ignores the resistances of ethereal creatures.

Staff of the Oceanwalker Staff (unique), legendary (requires attunement) Description: This staff appears a hue of shimmering blue, a side effect of the enchantment upon the driftwood used to create this magical item. History: In the Pirate Isles, there is an old myth of a man from the sea. He was given the nickname Oceanwalker by a fishing captain who was lost at sea during a particularly violent storm and claimed to have seen a shimmering light through nearly impenetrable downpour. As the ship was pummeled by the waves, he slowly steered his ship closer to the strange light. Wiping the water from his eyes, he rushed to the rail and doubted his rheumy eyes \u2014 there, barely twenty yards from his ship, walked a man carrying the light that had drawn the old sea captain; a light that slowly resolved itself into a shimmering blue staff. The man, not twenty yards away, walked calmly on the water like the storm wasn\u2019t even there!\u2003 Fearing that they had been lured to the deaths by some sort of vengeful water spirit, the captain was about to steer his ship away when the man with the staff stopped, looked back over his shoulder and pointed in the opposite direction. He then proceeded to continue walking and disappeared into the storm. Though the ship almost floundered numerous times through the night, the ship weathered the storm and reached port, having headed the direction given to them by man with the staff. Now and again some old sea dog will wander into a tavern telling of a man who walked on the water. Some say he swims like a fish, or rode upon an elemental manifestation of the sea itself, but all the stories agree on one detail, he is always carrying a shimmering blue staff, the Staff of the Oceanwalker.

Staff of Wizardry Staff legendary (requires attunement by an arcane caster) Description: These staffs are all crafted from twisted, knotted darkwood, polished to a smooth finish. The top of the staff is capped with a precious gemstone. History: All the great practitioners of the arcane throughout all the civilizations that have flourished and fallen throughout the Known Lands, have crafted their own Staff of Wizardry as a symbol of their mastery. From the great magi of ages past like the ssanu sorcerer Ss\u2019koreth, the elorii Grand Elementalist Rasmirinas, the Arch Magi of the Imperium of Man, Orris val\u2019Mordane to the modern age arcane master, Nurion val\u2019Assante, all wielded Staffs of Wizardry, albeit differing in appearance. Though it requires one supremely skilled to craft these staffs, they are quite durable, allowing those not as gifted to find ancient copies in the many crypts and ruins that dot Arcanis.

Spell Absorption: As a reaction, when targeted by a hostile spell you may absorb that spell into the staff of wizardry. The absorbed spell\u2019s effect is cancelled and the spell\u2019s energy\u2014though not the spell itself\u2014is stored within the staff. The staff gains a number of charges equal to the level of the absorbed spell.

This staff regains 6d6+6 expended charges daily at dawn. Stormhorn Staff very rare (requires attunement) Description: A Stormhorn is a magical staff crafted from the twisted tapering horns of a behir. A single light blue horn is affixed to a handle carved from the heartwood of an oak tree struck by lightning, and enchanted during a lightning storm.\u2003 History: Along the edge of the Amaryllis River, and along the coastline of Bhiharn, lies a dense tangle of mangrove swamps and murky salt marshes known as the Sword Fens. This fetid Swampland is home to the Undir, and serves mainly as a refuge for highwaymen and pirates. This region is best known for the horrid monsters that lurk in its mosquito-infested depths; trolls, hags and worse can be found within its lush green canopy. It is here that the Kio travel to gather the components necessary for Stormhorns. Though it is rumored that these fell beasts still roam the primeval swamps of the Kraldjur Morass, it is only in the Sword Fens that they can be encountered with any regularity. Finding and killing one of these huge beasts is no easy task, but once accomplished, the Kio collect their prize: a pair of long tapering horns that jut from the behir\u2019s head.

The staff itself is just about a man\u2019s height and made from a dull grey steel. Set into its base is a scratched and pitted metal sphere, and capped with the carved head of a nightfox. History: Sylab was not always Arena Master of Sicaris. Fie once was a lowly gladiator, skilled in battle, but condemned by his lack of showmanship. That changed when he caught the eye of Gioia vaFFiaupt, who was seeking a gladiator to invest in. She saw that Sylab not only fought with unparalleled skill, but he understood the business of the arena. As for his showmanship, that was easily supplemented. If he lacked personality, he would simply need a gimmick. Thus, she crafted this staff. With it, Sylab quickly became famous, dazzling audiences who breathlessly waited to see how he would configure his staff for the killing blow. His winnings made Gioia very rich, and earned Sylab the respect he needed to become Arena Master. Abilities/Effects: This staff can be wielded as a magic quarterstaff that grants a +1 bonus to both attack and damage rolls. By adjusting the clockwork mechanisms in the staff, the wielder may launch the carved head of the nightfox forth as a grappling hook connected to the staff by a 50-foot steel chain.

Tzizhet\u2019s Gibbering Staff Stajf, legendary (requires attunement by an arcane caster worshipper of Tzizhet or divine caster of Tzizhet) Description: This is a gnarled staff made of worm-eaten pale wood with many sickly discolored knots and small protrusions. When any of the powers are activated, the staff becomes fleshy and pulsates like a living thing, with the knots on the wand opening, revealing multicolored eyes and gnashing teeth.\u2003 History: Merishayeet sought one thing and one thing only, and that was to drive the Coryani from Abessios. In the fourth century, he received a vision, dark and blasphemous, which led him deep into the wilderness, and to the ruins of sunken Myrantis itself. He entered the ruins sane, if obsessed. After two weeks, he left it raving mad, missing an arm and an eye, and wielding the staff that he had carved and enchanted using secrets whispered to him within the ruins. Merishayeet sowed chaos among the Coryani before he was slain, but the staff was never recovered. Throughout the ages the staff has reappeared, always in the hands of a mad Myrantian prophet and rebel. Always it has been lost again upon the madman\u2019s death.

It appears adjacent to you, is friendly to you and your companions, and acts on its own initiative. You possess a mental link with the creature through which you may issue commands (no action required by you). If you don\u2019t issue any commands to the gibbering mouther, it simply attacks the nearest creature. The gibbering mouther remains for 1 hour unless destroyed or dismissed by you as an action. Once dismissed or destroyed, the gibbering mouther disappears with a foul\u00acsmelling mist equal to a stinking cloud (Save DC 14) as and the staff reappears in your hand as long both you and the gibbering mouther were on the same plane of existence.

History: Most worshippers of the goddess Anshar pray to Her as the patron of travelers and guardian of outcasts, but Her domains encompass pain and suffering, as well. A heretical cult worshipping Her aspect as the Agonized Martyr crafted this wand to share Her blessings with the world. They believe that only through extreme pain can one find enlightenment. They sought to share the gift of agony with others, and quickly ran afoul of the Coryani Inquisition.

Wand of Dancing Spirits Wand, uncommon (requires attunement by a primal spellcaster) Description: This wand is silver plated, runes stamped laterally from handle to tip. History: During the reign of Osric II the first serious effort was made to explore and catalogue the Faerdwalden. During these efforts Senta val\u2019Abebi, one of the chief researchers, had a strange encounter in the woods that convinced her a species dwelled within who could turn themselves invisible at will. The explorations were abandoned long before completion due to the costs of King Osric\u2019s wars, but Senta\u2019s obsession with these creatures only grew. She created the wand of dancing spirits to help her craft illusions as bait for these creatures, and illuminate their invisible forms in faerie fire.

Wand of Distraction Wand, uncommon (requires attunement by a primal spellcaster) Description: This wand is slim and metallic in its construction. A poorly etched rune of lightning is inscribed upon it. History: Darius val\u2019Holryn was jealous of his cousin, Leticia, whose bloodline ability mimicked the val\u2019Tensen. This allowed her to call down lightning from the sky, while he benefited from the val\u2019Abebi bloodline powers, which gave him a superb memory and a penchant for knowledge. As they grew older, Darius would fume as Leticia would strike down the enemies of the family with coruscating bolts of energy, while he was told that he would serve best from a desk and surrounded by musty books. After reading treatise written by the Archmagi Nurion, it occurred to him that he could immediate and perhaps exceed his cousin\u2019s powers by fashioning a wand of lightning. Working with the family artificer, he quickly inscribed the lightning rune and joined his family in a quick sojourn to Ashvan, near the border with Canceri. On the road, they were attacked and Darius arrogantly stepped in front of his father, a warrior of renown, and fired his wand. To his utter humiliation, a shower of sparks and swirling fireworks, distracting the attacker long enough for his father to dispatch him. Abilities/Effects: This wand has 7 charges.

History: Despite the power they wield, the greatest threat to mages are the superstitious and fearful country folk. Many mages, usually ones that have recently discovered their gift, have fallen victim to angry mobs and beaten or killed. The masters of the Sanctorum of the Arcane understand that these attacks are fueled by ignorance rather than malicious intent and created a wand that deals with these mobs in a non-lethal manner. The wand of grasping earth is given to members that search for untrained mages, taking them where they can safely train. The wand causes the very ground to reach up, tripping and entangling foes, giving them time to escape without causing permanent harm to their pursuers. Abilities/Effects: This wand has 7 charges. While holding this wand, as an action you can expend 1 charge to cast entangle (save DC 15). The wand regains ld6 +1 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a roll of 1, the wand withers and crumbles into dust. Wand of Ice Wand, uncommon (requires attunement by a spellcaster) Description: This wand appears as a branched icicle and very cold to the touch. History: Strange as it may seem, the first wand of ice was created in the deserts of the Coryani province of Toranesta, in what is now the Abessian Dominion. Tatiana Gracci, a distant scion of the Coryani Gracci family, despised the heat of the desert. Although a legionnaire with little magical talent, she was determined to develop a way to keep herself cool. After spending all her spare time in experimentation, she ultimately failed. But in her failure, she created something far more useful, which served her legion well on the battlefield. Abilities/Effects: This wand has 7 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend one charge to cast black ice (save DC 14) from it. When you use the wand this way, the spell creates a patch of black ice instead of an oil slick. The wand regains ld6+l expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the wand\u2019s last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the wand melts and dissolves into nothingness.

Race Restrictions The Path of the Possessed is a Primal Casting class, as such dwarves, elorii, kio, ss\u2019ressen, val may not choose this archetype. Fury and Power Your spiritus imperare has granted you the ability to cast a small number of primal spells, but only when you rage. Spell Slots When you choose this path at 3 rd level, you gain 1 spell slot. You gain another spell slot at 11 th level, and at 19 th level. These spell slots are of a spell level equal to half your level in this class, up to a maximum of 5 th level. You can cast spells when you are raging, but only if you use the spell slots and spells granted by your spiritus imperare. While raging, you may maintain concentration on spells cast with this feature but lose concentration when your rage ends. You regain all expended spell slots from this feature when you finish a short or long rest. Spells Known You know the spells granted by your spiritus imperare. Spellcasting Ability Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your spiritus imperare\u2019s spells, so you use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a spiritus imperare spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one. Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier Spellcasting Focus You are considered your own primal spellcasting focus when casting spells from your spiritus imperare\u2019s spell list. The Jealousy of Spirits Spiritus imperare are jealous spirits. If you have or take levels in any class or sub-class that grants you a spirit patron, your spiritus imperare becomes your spirit patron. If you have the Pact Magic feature, you can use your spell slots from that feature while raging. Spiritus imperare (Dominant Spirit) Starting when you choose this path at 3 rd level, you attract the attention of a savage, nearly feral spirit. Your spiritus imperare grants you spells and spell slots, as well as other abilities at 3 rd , 6 th , 10 th and 14 th level in this class. Any ability gained from you spiritus imperare that calls for a saving throw uses your spell save DC. Your spiritus imperare also exacts a price from you. You must abide by the conditions specified in the price of your spiritus imperare, or it will withdraw its power. This might mean losing access to the abilities it gives you or your spells. Spirit of Hatred Usually taking the form of a wolf, shark or wasp, your spiritus imperare is ruled by hate, commonly aimed at a race, nationality, or profession. Although you may not share the same animosity, the spirit within you sometimes gets the best of you, making you say and do things to show its displeasure. Whispers of Hate (Price): You or your GM must choose a race, nationality, or profession. You find it very hard to treat a creature from your chosen race, nationality, or profession with any level of respect. Unless you and your spiritus imperare share the same animosity, you know that this hatred is from it. You suffer disadvantage on all Charisma checks when dealing with the subject of your hate. You may make a DC 15 Wisdom check to try and suppress your hatred, letting you make Charisma checks normally for 1 minute. If you fail this check, you must enter a rage and lash out at the subject of your hatred. Spirits of Hatred\u2019s spells The Spirit of Hatred gives you following spells: Spell Level Spells 1 st Hellish rebuke 2 nd Dragon\u2019s roar* 3 rd Mantle of unassailable flame* 4 th Fire shield Blinded by Hate Beginning at 3 rd level, you may give yourself to the hate within. As a bonus action, choose one creature within 30 feet that you can see to become the focus of your hate for 1 minute. If you attack the focus of your hate using your Reckless Attack feature, you may forgo the advantage you gain on your attack roll and deal an additional 1d8 damage instead. This damage is the same type as your weapon. While you have a creature selected as the focus of your hate, you cannot benefit from Reckless Attack when you target any other creature with an attack. Once you use this feature, you cannot use it again until you complete a short or long rest. Hateful Gaze Beginning at 6 th level, you gain double your proficiency bonus on all Charisma (Intimidate) checks. Also, as an action, you may turn your abhorrence-filled gaze on a creature you can see within 30 feet. The creature must make a Charisma saving throw and if they fail, they have disadvantage on the next attack they make that targets you. They also have disadvantage on the next saving throw they make to resist the effects of a spell you cast, if cast within 1 hour. If your target succeeds on its saving throw, it is immune to your Hateful Gaze for 1 day. Undead, constructs and creatures that cannot see are immune to this feature. Petrifying Gaze Beginning at 10 th level, any time you hit a creature with a melee attack you may, as a reaction, stare own, shaking them to their core. They must succeed in a Wisdom saving throw or become stunned until the end of your next turn. You may use this ability a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1), regaining all expended uses at the completion of a long rest. Consumed by Hate Starting at 14 th level, when you rage you become fully consumed by hate and ignore wounds that would fall a lesser person. While you are raging, you cannot be charmed or frightened. In addition, at the start of your turn you gain 5 temporary hit points. When your rage ends, you gain 1 level of exhaustion. Spirit of Heroism These spirits appear as eagles, falcons or lions and urge those who bear them to be true Heroes. These furies take up a cause and fight for it, regardless of risk and heedless of the cost. A fury with this spiritus imperare is consumed and obsessed by their righteous cause. Righteous Cause (Price): Choose a heroic cause. This cause can be things like destroy infernals, protect arcane casters from the Harvesters, seek out cults of the Silence and destroy them, or defend the people of Coryan from the threat of the gar. When presented with an opportunity to champion your cause you will do everything in your power to complete it. If you rage during such an occasion, you cannot willingly end your rage as a bonus action unless you make a successful DC 15 Wisdom check. Spirits of Heroism spells The Spirit of Heroism gifts you with the following spells: Spell Level Spells 1 st Righteous fury* 2 nd Magic weapon 3 rd Beacon of hope 4 th Freedom of movement Righteous Blows Starting when you choose this spirit at 3 rd level, you find that when you rage you are infused with the unyielding righteousness. While raging, your melee attacks deal additional radiant damage equal to your Constitution modifier. Righteous Defence Beginning at 6 th level, creatures provoke opportunity attacks from you any time a friendly creature within 5 feet of you is struck with a melee attack by a creature adjacent to you. Strength of Will Beginning at 10 th level, while raging you are immune to the charmed and frightened conditions. Additionally, if you are stunned you may immediately use your reaction to end the condition. Righteous is my Cause Starting at 14 th level, any time you rage while in pursuit of your cause you project a 20-foot radius aura of righteousness, infusing your allies with fury. All friendly creatures within your aura cannot be frightened and are blessed as if under the effects of the spell. Once you use this ability you may not call upon it again until you complete a short or long rest. Spirit of Savagery Taking the form of badgers or wolverines, spirits of savagery revel in bloodshed and wild frenzy. Those who bear these spirits love nothing more than to feel the splash of warm blood over their faces, and seeing the light dim in their victims\u2019 eyes. Unbridled Savagery (Price): Your spiritus imperare demands blood, a gift you are more than willing to give. While you are raging, when you reduce a creature to 0 hit points, you must kill them. You will not simply knock someone out to spare them. You may attempt to fight this bloodlust. When you reduce a creature to 0 hit points, if you make a successful DC 15 Wisdom check you suppress your bloodlust and may choose to spare your target. If you do, your spiritus imperare is disgusted with you and ends your rage instantly. If you fail this check, you must kill your target. Spirits of Savagery\u2019s spells The Spirit of Savagery gifts you with the following known spells: Spell Level Spells 1 st False life 2 nd Primal senses* 3 rd Haste 4 th Confusion Unchained Savagery Starting when this spirit is chosen at 3 rd level, when you engage in two-weapon fighting, you can add your ability modifier to the damage of the second attack. Additionally, you can draw or stow two one-handed weapons when you would normally be able to draw or stow one. Also, while you are raging and engage in two-weapon fighting, if you reduce a creature to 0 hit points you may, as a reaction, take the Dash action.","title":"\u0412\u0430\u0440\u0432\u0430\u0440"},{"location":"homerules/homerules/classes/barbarian/#barbarian","text":"","title":"Barbarian"},{"location":"homerules/homerules/classes/barbarian/#path-of-the-possessed","text":"In enclosed, sweltering huts across the Known Lands, select members of a tribe endure a days long ritual that tests the limits of their strength and fortitude.

You can cast spells when you are raging, but only if you use the spell slots and spells granted by your spiritus imperare. While raging, you may maintain concentration on spells cast with this feature but lose concentration when your rage ends. You regain all expended spell slots from this feature when you finish a short or long rest. Spells Known You know the spells granted by your spiritus imperare. Spellcasting Ability Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your spiritus imperare\u2019s spells, so you use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a spiritus imperare spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one. Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier Spellcasting Focus You are considered your own primal spellcasting focus when casting spells from your spiritus imperare\u2019s spell list. The Jealousy of Spirits Spiritus imperare are jealous spirits. If you have or take levels in any class or sub-class that grants you a spirit patron, your spiritus imperare becomes your spirit patron. If you have the Pact Magic feature, you can use your spell slots from that feature while raging. Spiritus imperare (Dominant Spirit) Starting when you choose this path at 3 rd level, you attract the attention of a savage, nearly feral spirit. Your spiritus imperare grants you spells and spell slots, as well as other abilities at 3 rd , 6 th , 10 th and 14 th level in this class. Any ability gained from you spiritus imperare that calls for a saving throw uses your spell save DC. Your spiritus imperare also exacts a price from you. You must abide by the conditions specified in the price of your spiritus imperare, or it will withdraw its power. This might mean losing access to the abilities it gives you or your spells. Spirit of Hatred Usually taking the form of a wolf, shark or wasp, your spiritus imperare is ruled by hate, commonly aimed at a race, nationality, or profession. Although you may not share the same animosity, the spirit within you sometimes gets the best of you, making you say and do things to show its displeasure. Whispers of Hate (Price): You or your GM must choose a race, nationality, or profession. You find it very hard to treat a creature from your chosen race, nationality, or profession with any level of respect. Unless you and your spiritus imperare share the same animosity, you know that this hatred is from it. You suffer disadvantage on all Charisma checks when dealing with the subject of your hate. You may make a DC 15 Wisdom check to try and suppress your hatred, letting you make Charisma checks normally for 1 minute. If you fail this check, you must enter a rage and lash out at the subject of your hatred. Spirits of Hatred\u2019s spells The Spirit of Hatred gives you following spells: Spell Level Spells 1 st Hellish rebuke 2 nd Dragon\u2019s roar* 3 rd Mantle of unassailable flame* 4 th Fire shield Blinded by Hate Beginning at 3 rd level, you may give yourself to the hate within. As a bonus action, choose one creature within 30 feet that you can see to become the focus of your hate for 1 minute. If you attack the focus of your hate using your Reckless Attack feature, you may forgo the advantage you gain on your attack roll and deal an additional 1d8 damage instead. This damage is the same type as your weapon. While you have a creature selected as the focus of your hate, you cannot benefit from Reckless Attack when you target any other creature with an attack. Once you use this feature, you cannot use it again until you complete a short or long rest. Hateful Gaze Beginning at 6 th level, you gain double your proficiency bonus on all Charisma (Intimidate) checks. Also, as an action, you may turn your abhorrence-filled gaze on a creature you can see within 30 feet. The creature must make a Charisma saving throw and if they fail, they have disadvantage on the next attack they make that targets you. They also have disadvantage on the next saving throw they make to resist the effects of a spell you cast, if cast within 1 hour. If your target succeeds on its saving throw, it is immune to your Hateful Gaze for 1 day. Undead, constructs and creatures that cannot see are immune to this feature. Petrifying Gaze Beginning at 10 th level, any time you hit a creature with a melee attack you may, as a reaction, stare own, shaking them to their core. They must succeed in a Wisdom saving throw or become stunned until the end of your next turn. You may use this ability a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1), regaining all expended uses at the completion of a long rest. Consumed by Hate Starting at 14 th level, when you rage you become fully consumed by hate and ignore wounds that would fall a lesser person. While you are raging, you cannot be charmed or frightened. In addition, at the start of your turn you gain 5 temporary hit points. When your rage ends, you gain 1 level of exhaustion. Spirit of Heroism These spirits appear as eagles, falcons or lions and urge those who bear them to be true Heroes. These furies take up a cause and fight for it, regardless of risk and heedless of the cost. A fury with this spiritus imperare is consumed and obsessed by their righteous cause. Righteous Cause (Price): Choose a heroic cause. This cause can be things like destroy infernals, protect arcane casters from the Harvesters, seek out cults of the Silence and destroy them, or defend the people of Coryan from the threat of the gar. When presented with an opportunity to champion your cause you will do everything in your power to complete it. If you rage during such an occasion, you cannot willingly end your rage as a bonus action unless you make a successful DC 15 Wisdom check. Spirits of Heroism spells The Spirit of Heroism gifts you with the following spells: Spell Level Spells 1 st Righteous fury* 2 nd Magic weapon 3 rd Beacon of hope 4 th Freedom of movement Righteous Blows Starting when you choose this spirit at 3 rd level, you find that when you rage you are infused with the unyielding righteousness. While raging, your melee attacks deal additional radiant damage equal to your Constitution modifier. Righteous Defence Beginning at 6 th level, creatures provoke opportunity attacks from you any time a friendly creature within 5 feet of you is struck with a melee attack by a creature adjacent to you. Strength of Will Beginning at 10 th level, while raging you are immune to the charmed and frightened conditions. Additionally, if you are stunned you may immediately use your reaction to end the condition. Righteous is my Cause Starting at 14 th level, any time you rage while in pursuit of your cause you project a 20-foot radius aura of righteousness, infusing your allies with fury. All friendly creatures within your aura cannot be frightened and are blessed as if under the effects of the spell. Once you use this ability you may not call upon it again until you complete a short or long rest. Spirit of Savagery Taking the form of badgers or wolverines, spirits of savagery revel in bloodshed and wild frenzy. Those who bear these spirits love nothing more than to feel the splash of warm blood over their faces, and seeing the light dim in their victims\u2019 eyes. Unbridled Savagery (Price): Your spiritus imperare demands blood, a gift you are more than willing to give. While you are raging, when you reduce a creature to 0 hit points, you must kill them. You will not simply knock someone out to spare them. You may attempt to fight this bloodlust. When you reduce a creature to 0 hit points, if you make a successful DC 15 Wisdom check you suppress your bloodlust and may choose to spare your target. If you do, your spiritus imperare is disgusted with you and ends your rage instantly. If you fail this check, you must kill your target. Spirits of Savagery\u2019s spells The Spirit of Savagery gifts you with the following known spells: Spell Level Spells 1 st False life 2 nd Primal senses* 3 rd Haste 4 th Confusion Unchained Savagery Starting when this spirit is chosen at 3 rd level, when you engage in two-weapon fighting, you can add your ability modifier to the damage of the second attack. Additionally, you can draw or stow two one-handed weapons when you would normally be able to draw or stow one. Also, while you are raging and engage in two-weapon fighting, if you reduce a creature to 0 hit points you may, as a reaction, take the Dash action.","title":"Path of the Possessed"},{"location":"homerules/homerules/classes/elder-sorcerer/","text":"Elder Sorcerer \u00b6 Arcane magic taps into the residual energy of Creation to achieve miraculous and often mind-bending effects. This gives these ancient practitioners mastery over such exotic effects as creating an object out of thin air, changing the very essence of one thing to another, or tapping directly into the raw building blocks of reality, such as the Elemental Planes. The Elder Tradition of magic is practiced by the elder races of Arcanis, such as the ssanu, il\u2019Huan, and the elorii. Elder magic tends to be meticulous and precise, befitting races that are so long lived that a decade is a reasonable amount of time to have a discussion. What differentiates elder magic from the eldritch magic practiced by the younger races, such as humans, is the precision in which the raw energy is manifested. Though this assiduous attention to detail makes elder magic potent, it is much slower to cast than its eldritch counterpart. Many wise and intelligent humans have tried to master the Elder Tradition but the rare individual that comes near to succeeding have been driven mad. Many speculate that the human mind lacks certain physiology that the elder races possess and are thus incapable of mastering this tradition. Class Features As an elder sorcerer, you gain the following class features: Race Restrictions Only races the Elder Spellcaster racial feature may take levels in this class. Hit Points Hit Points: 1d6 per elder sorcerer level Hit Points at 1 st level: 6 + your Constitution modifier Hit Points at Higher Levels: 1d6 (4) + your Constitution modifier per elder sorcerer level after 1 st Proficiencies Armor: None Weapons: Daggers, darts, slings, quarterstaffs, light crossbows Tools: None Saving Throws: Intelligence, Wisdom Skills: Choose two from Arcana, History, Insight, Investigation, Linguistics, Medicine, Religion, and Stealth.

If you choose a weapon with ammunition you start with 20 bolts or arrows. \u2022 Choose any two weapons you are proficient with from your starting nation. \u2022 Choose either a component pouch or an arcane focus \u2022 Choose either a scholar\u2019s pack or an explorer\u2019s pack Hunted by Ymandragore The Sorcerer King of Ymandragore hunts all arcane spellcasters.

Spellcasting Ability Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your elder sorcerer spells. Your magic comes from your knowledge and study of the universe. You can use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for an elder sorcerer spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one. Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier Elder Ritual Casting You can cast any elder sorcerer spell you know as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag. When you cast an elder sorcerer spell as a ritual, it takes 15 minutes to cast instead of the normal time, but the spell\u2019s duration is doubled. Spellcasting Focus You can use an arcane focus as a spellcasting focus for your elder sorcerer spells. Arcane Recovery You have learned to regain some of your magical energy through meditative practices and ceremonies. Once per day when you finish a short rest, you can choose expended spell slots to recover. The spell slots can have a combined level that is equal to or less than half your elder sorcerer level (rounded up), and none of the slots can be of 6 th level or higher. For example, if you\u2019re a 4 th level elder sorcerer, you can recover up to two levels worth of spell slots. You can either recover a 2 nd -level spell slot or two 1 st -level spell slots. Elder Sorcerer Tradition When you reach 2 nd level, you choose an arcane tradition, shaping your magical practice. The traditions are detailed at the end of this chapter. Your choice grants you features at 2 nd level and again at 6 th , 10 th , and 14 th level. Arcane Flexibility At 3 rd level, you learn how to mold and shape your spells as you cast them. You gain 2 arcane points and you gain more arcane points as you reach higher levels in this class, as shown in the Arcane Points column of the Elder Sorcerer table. You can never have more arcane points than shown on the table for your level. You regain all spent arcane points when you finish a long rest. See Chapter VI: Magic of Arcanis for more information on arcane points and how to use them. Metamagic Starting at 3 rd level, you gain the ability to twist your spells to suit your needs. You learn the Metamagic option Subtle Spell. You also gain one other Metamagic option of your choice and you gain another one at 7 th level. You can only use one Metamagic option on a spell when you cast it, unless otherwise noted. See Chapter VI: Magic of Arcanis for a complete list of Metamagic options and how to use to use them. Ability Score Improvement When you reach 4 th level, and again at 8 th , 12 th and 16 th and 19 th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can\u2019t increase an ability over 20 by using this feature. Meticulous Spell Shaping Starting at 5 th level, whenever you cast an elder sorcerer spell that forces other creatures to make a saving throw, you can protect some of those creatures from the spell\u2019s full force. To do so, you spend 1 arcane point and choose a number of those creatures up to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1). A chosen creature automatically succeeds on its saving throw against your spell. When you reach 9 th level in this class, chosen creatures have resistance to your spell\u2019s damage. When you reach 13 th level, chosen creatures take no damage from your spell. Reclaim Control Starting at 7 th level, any time you lose concentration on a spell that summons a creature, such as conjure elemental, you may, as a reaction, spend 2 arcane points to force the creatures your summoned to make a Charisma saving throw. If a creature you summoned with the triggering spell fails their saving throw, you regain your concentration on the spell and control over your summoned creatures. Any creature that succeeds on their saving throw resists your control, even if you regain your concentration on the triggering spell. Elder Ritualist Starting at 18 th level, you can cast any elder sorcerer spell that you know of 6 th level or below that does not require concentration as a ritual spell. Signature Spells When you reach 20 th level, you gain mastery over three powerful spells and can cast them with little effort. Choose a 1 st level elder sorcerer spell, a 2 nd level elder sorcerer spell, and a 3 rd level elder sorcerer spell that you know as your signature spells. You can cast these spells at their lowest level without expending a spell slot. If you want to cast these spells Arc anis 5e \u2022 Chap ter 2: Cl a sse s 78 at a higher level, you must expend a spell slot as normal. By spending 8 hours in study, you can exchange any of the spells you chose for different spells of the same level. Elder Sorcerer Traditions Spellcasters in the Elder Tradition devote entire lifetimes to the perfection of one spell or mastering one school of magic. Such dedication takes time, but for an immortal race time is an endless resource. Arcanist The Arcanist does not seek to master a single aspect of the arcane arts but rather the techniques of casting spells. They seek to master a spell\u2019s placement and refine its use; they seek enlightenment within the pull and push of the forces used to create the effect. An Arcanist seeks to perfect their art through skillful and thoughtful execution. Arcane Precision Starting at 3 rd level, as a bonus action you can spend 1 arcane point to grant yourself advantage on your next spell attack roll. Expanded Knowledge At 6 th level, you learn an additional Metamagic option of your choice. See Chapter VI: Magic of Arcanis for a complete list of Metamagic options. Elder Efficiency Beginning at 10 th level, any time you cast a spell of 3 rd level or higher using a spell slot of a slot level higher than required for the spell, you regain 2 expended arcane points. Refined Metamagic Starting at 14 th level, you can manipulate spells with little effort. Choose one Metamagic option you know that requires 2 or less arcane points to use. You may now use that Metamagic option three times when you cast an elder sorcerer spell without expending arcane points, regaining all expended uses of this feature when you complete a long rest. Conjurer Conjurers focus on calling forth elementals and other servants. Many elorii devote themselves to the study of conjuration as their birthright as scions of the lost Elemental Lords. Other elorii see elementals as useful and even willing tools in the battle to restore their place in the world. Elemental Servant Starting at 2 nd level you gain the services of an elemental servant. You learn the spell find familiar and may use it to summon an elemental servant instead of a familiar. See Appendix 1: Bestiary for your elemental servant\u2019s stats. Your elemental servant gains all the benefits of your Elemental Companion feature. You can have only one elemental servant at a time. Unlike a normal familiar, when you dismiss your elemental servant, it returns to the Elemental Plane it came from but does not regain any lost hit points or spent hit die until it spends at least 8 hours on its home plane. Your elemental servant will then regain all of its hit points and spent hit dice. If your elemental servant is ever slain, you may not summon a new one until you complete long rest. The elemental servant you then summon is not the same one you had before, it is a new creature. Elemental Companion Your elemental servant gains a variety of benefits. When you take the Attack action, you can forgo one of your own attacks to allow your elemental servant to make one attack, using its reaction. Starting at 11 th level, as a bonus action you can have your elemental servant make one attack, using its reaction. If you are incapacitated, your elemental servant will only take actions to protect you. If you are absent, your elemental servant will follow the last set of commands you gave it. Your elemental servant adds your proficiency bonus to attack rolls and saving throws. For each sorcerer level you gain after 5 th , your elemental servant gains an additional hit die and increases its maximum hit points by 5. Master Summoner At 6 th level, you are adept at calling forth creatures from the Elemental Planes. Any time you cast a spell that calls forth one or more elementals, you can spend 2 arcane points to give the elementals you summon the following benefits: \u2022 Your summoned elementals add your proficiency bonus to their AC and damage rolls. \u2022 Your summoned elementals have advantage on all saving throws. \u2022 Your summoned elementals have the maximum possible hit points for their hit dice. Elemental Infusion At 10 th level, you have learned how to use your spells to heal your elemental companions. You can target either your elemental servant or an elemental you have called forth with an elder sorcerer spell and expend one of your spell slots to restore hit points to it. The amount of hit points you restore to the elemental is based on the level of the spell slot you expend. If you expend a 1 st level spell slot you restore 1d8 + your Intelligence modifier. For every slot level above the 1 st that you expend, the healing increases by 1d8. Conjurer\u2019s Grace At 14 th level, you have mastered the art of summoning. You no longer need to make a concentration check when you take damage while concentrating on a spell that calls forth one or more elementals. Elorii Elementalist Created through a combination of ssanu technomancy, elemental magic, and the essence of a goddess, the elorii have a unique elemental resonance. As masters of the Arcanum and practitioners of the complex and demanding Elder Tradition, it was only a matter of time before the elorii started to experiment with their own elemental nature. Like a master musician finding the right note, elorii elementalists learn to modify and focus the resonance within them, amplifying it tenfold. Elorii elementalists master their magic through deep introspection. They strive to fully comprehend their elemental nature and learn how to pull upon the potency of their ancestry to enhance their spells. Racial Restriction: Only elorii may become elorii elementalists. As you gain levels in the elder sorcerer class you must choose the elemental powers pertaining to your sub-race.

You can cast jump and featherfall on yourself at will, without expending a spell slot or material components.

For the duration, you gain the following benefits: Damage Resistances: cold; bludgeoning and piercing from nonmagical attacks Damage Immunities: poison and slashing Condition Immunities: exhaustion, grappled, paralyzed, petrified, poisoned, prone, restrained, unconscious Magi Elder sorcerers who follow the path of the Magi focus on the depths that only elder magic can reach, such as creating things out of nothing and manipulating the mind. Ebon Arcanum Starting at 2 nd level you learn how to use the ebon arcanum, a strange manipulation of the powers of Creation that conjures dark, crackling energy you can form into objects of power. While any elder sorcerer can cast ebon blade*, it is the Magi who truly learn to shape and manipulate the ebon arcanum. Ebon Blade: If you do not already know the cantrip ebon blade you learn it. Whenever you cast ebon blade, you can create a weapon with the heavy or two-handed property. You can also spend 1 arcane point to change the damage of your weapon to force damage.

This bonus increases when you reach higher levels in this class, becoming +2 at 9 th level and +3 at 17 th level. Ebon Armor: As long as you are not wearing armor, as a bonus action you can surround yourself in a protective magical force made of the same crackling energy as your ebon blade. Your Armor Class becomes 13 + your Dexterity modifier. Your ebon armor lasts until you don armor, you are incapacitated, or until you dismiss it as a bonus action. You can use a shield and still benefit from your ebon armor. Beginning at 6 th level, you can activate your ebon armor as a reaction when you roll initiative or when you are attacked. Ebon Blade Mastery Beginning at 6 th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action with a weapon created with ebon blade*. Enhanced Arcane Defence Starting at 10 th level, when you are sheathed in your ebon armor, any time you take damage you may use your reaction to gain resistance against that damage. Ebon Mastery At 14 th level, you have mastered the ebon arcanum. Your ebon armor and ebon blade are improved in the following ways: Ebon Armor: Your Armor Class is now 15 + your Dexterity modifier when you summon your ebon armor. Ebon Blade: Whenever you cast ebon blade, you can spend 1 arcane point to cover the weapon you create in damaging energy.

Equipment You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background. See Chapter IV of the Campaign Setting for Regional weapons and armor. If you choose a weapon with ammunition you start with 20 bolts or arrows. \u2022 Choose any two weapons you are proficient with from your starting nation. \u2022 The equivalent of leather armor from your starting nation. \u2022 Choose either a component pouch or an arcane focus \u2022 Choose either a scholar\u2019s pack or an explorer\u2019s pack Hunted by Ymandragore The Sorcerer King of Ymandragore hunts all arcane spellcasters. Displaying one\u2019s sorcerous skills openly or in a public setting is a sure way to end one\u2019s career early. Ancient Pact At 1 st level, you have learned the necessary rites to call upon ancient pacts. The following pacts are for elorii heroes only and are made with the elemental lord associated with your bloodline. You are granted features at 1 st level and again at 3 rd , 6 th , 10 th , 14 th , and 20 th level. While this book focuses upon elorii, pacts for other elder casters will be details in future products. Sorcerous Pact Magic Your arcane research and exposure to the practices of ancient pacts have given you facility with a number of spells from the elder warlock spell list. Cantrips You know two cantrips of your choice from the elder warlock spell list. You learn additional elder warlock Cantrips of your choice from the elder warlock spell list at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Elder Warlock table. Sped Slots The elder warlock table shows how many spell slots you have. The table also shows what the level of those slots is; all of your spell slots are the same level. To cast one of your elder warlock spells of 1 st level or higher, you must expend a spell slot. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a short or long rest. For example, when you are 5 th level, you have two 3 rd -level spell slots. To cast the 1 st -level spell color spray, you must spend one of those slots, and you cast it as a 3 rd -level spell. Spells Known of 1 st Level and Higher At 1 st level, you know two 1 st -level spells of your choice from the elder warlock spell list. The Spells Known column of the Elder Warlock table shows when you learn more elder warlock spells of your choice of 1 st level and higher. A spell you choose must be of a level no higher than what\u2019s shown in the table\u2019s Slot Level column for your level. When you reach 6 th level, for example, you learn a new elder warlock spell, which can be 1 st , 2 nd , or 3 rd level. Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the elder warlock spells you know and replace it with another spell from the elder warlock list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots. Spellcasting Ability Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your elder warlock spells, so you use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, your Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier and your Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier. Spellcasting Focus You can use an arcane focus as a spellcasting focus for your elder warlock spells. Arcane Invocations In your study of arcane lore, you have mastered Arcane Invocations, rituals that imbue you with magical abilities. At 2 nd level, you gain two invocations of your choice. Your invocation options are detailed at the end of the class description. When you gain certain elder warlock levels, you gain additional invocations of your choice, as shown in the Invocations Known column of the elder warlock table. Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the invocations you know and replace it with another invocation that you could learn at that level. Note that the use of any invocation with an obviously magical effect may draw the attention of Ymandragore just as if you had cast an arcane spell. At the gamemaster\u2019s discretion, you may activate an invocation with subtlety as if you had cast an arcane spell of a level equal to your elder warlock spell slot levels. Elder Arcanum At 11 th level, your studies into ancient magic and pacts allow you to discover an arcane secret called an Elder Arcanum. Choose one 6 th - level spell from the elder warlock spell list as this arcanum. You can cast your arcanum spell once without expending a spell slot. You must finish a long rest before you can do so again. At higher levels, you gain more elder warlock spells of your choice that can be cast in this way: one 7 th - level spell at 13 th level, one 8 th -level spell at 15 th level, and one 9 th -level spell at 17 th level. You regain all uses of your Elder Arcanum when you finish a long rest. Invocations If an invocation has prerequisites, you must meet them to learn it.

The Mad King of the Crushing Depths (Berokene) The most detailed notes left behind by the dread ssanu sorcerers of the Black Coil dealt with traveling to a watery realm known as the Crushing Deep. This elemental sphere was many times removed from the Mortal Realm that Arcanis resides within, but seemed to be accessible, unlike the Inner Elemental Realms, which were barred to Telas. Anticipating the need to carry over his own breathable atmosphere and some way to fend off the immense pressure promised by the name of the realm, Telas toiled for months before perfecting a new spell he dubbed the cloak of life. He believed that when the spell was cast, it would protect him from whatever inhospitable environment he would find on his travels. Putting faith in his mastery of the arcane arts, Telas cast his newly crafted spell of protection and opened the way to the Realm of the Crushing Deep. Instantly, he was immersed in inky blackness and the vast pressure from the many tons of water above him constricted his chest and made his head pound, despite his precaution. Slowly, the archmage\u2019s eyes adjusted to the dimness and he began to see phosphorescent trails and spots glowing all about him. This faint light revealed that he was in a place consisting almost entirely of ocean water with a few mountain-sized islands floating at different depths. Suddenly, he saw shapes resolve themselves from the gloom. At first, he feared that he had made an error and blundered into a lost ssanu stronghold, for the creatures moving speedily towards him possessed a torso much like his, but with lower extremities that lashed back and forth like a serpent\u2019s tail. Steadying his nerves, knowing full well that any attempt to flee and elude his pursuers was hopeless, Telas readied himself and was relieved to find that though the beings before him had a passing similarity in physiology to the elorii\u2019s ancient serpentine masters, they were of a new and unknown species. After demanding that he identify himself and answer their questions, they were eventually convinced that the archmage was not hostile and, though they politely refused to answer his queries, they escorted him towards the floating landmasses. Upon the largest of these submerged islands Telas found the demesne of the so-called Mad King of the Crushing Deep. Though quite insane by any elorii (or human) standard, the Mad King was also relatively affable and curious about those \u201cwithout\u201d visiting his domain. When first addressed by Telas, the Mad King was amazed at the existence of the elorii. Though he had not heard of an entity named Beroe or any of the other Elemental Lords, he became instantly curious about the Berokene cousins of Telas, the archmage being a Kelekene. After some time, Telas ended his visit with a bargain struck on behalf of Berokene that were versed in elemental sorcery. For a price, (for the Mad King and all his subjects placed great value on fire opals that existed nowhere in that realm, he and his retainers would honor the oaths made with Telas and offer aid and even succor to those who called upon them. You have invoked the Ancient Pact with the Mad King of the Crushing Depths. In return for gifts of fire opals, a rare commodity in the Mad King\u2019s realm, he is willing to send you aid. This connection has additionally channeled and influenced your arcane studies into focusing on your elemental bloodline\u2019s connection to those cold depths. Expanded Sped List The Mad King of the Crushing Depths lets you choose from an expanded list of Spells when you learn an elder warlock spell. The following spells are added to the elder warlock spell list for you. Spells marked with f are found in the Arcanis 5e Campaign Setting and spells marked with a * are new spells found in Chapter IV: Elder Magic of Arcanis.

It deals your choice of Cold or Slashing damage, chosen at the time of casting, and the beams are made of freezing, ink-dark water. Boon of the Mad King of the Crushing Depths Starting at 3 rd level, The Mad King of the Crushing Depths has agreed to allow you to summon warriors from his realm. As an action, you may expend an elder warlock spell slot and sacrifice fire opals worth at least 10 gold pieces to summon a Warrior of the Crashing Waves, which appears in an unoccupied space next to you. The Warrior of the Crashing Waves is friendly to you and will disappear when it drops to 0 hit points, after it has served you for one hour, or if you dismiss it as an action. It will also disappear if it is successfully targeted by a casting of dispel magic (or a similar spell or effect) capable of dispelling a spell cast with your elder warlock spell slot. Until the Warrior of the Crashing Waves disappears, you cannot maintain concentration on any spell which conjures or summons a creature or creatures. The Warrior of the Crashing Waves will obey your verbal commands, requiring no action, so long as you share a language with it. If you issue no commands, then the Warrior of the Crashing Waves will attack any creature it sees that is obviously hostile to you. Once you use this feature, you can\u2019t use it again until you complete a long rest. The action used to activate this feature may be interrupted by counterspell as if it were a spell cast with your elder warlock spell slot, in which case the elder warlock spell slot is still expended but the fire opals are not sacrificed, and this feature is not considered to have been used. Starting at 6 th level, you may instead use this feature to summon an Ice Giant Champion of Gayal. If you do so, then the sacrificed fire opals must be worth at least 75 gold pieces. Starting at 14 th level, you may instead use this feature to summon an Aquamancer from the Crushing Deep. If you do so, then the sacrificed fire opals must be worth at least 200 gold pieces. Starting at 6 th level, your connection to the realm of the Mad King of the Crushing Depths has fortified you against that which is anathema to your elemental nature and the nature of his realm. You gain resistance to fire damage. Blessing of the Crushing Depths Starting at 10 th level, your connection to the realm of the Mad King of the Crushing Depths has enhanced your natural resistance to cold to fortify you against the nature of his realm. You gain immunity to cold damage.

So long as you are adjacent to a body of water large enough to contain her, as an action you may sacrifice fire opals worth at least 2000 gold pieces to summon Vardaka, who appears in a space of water adjacent to you. Vardaka is friendly to you and your allies, though her frenzy ability may lead to her attacking an ally by mistake. She will disappear when she drops to 0 hit points or after she has served you for 10 minutes for every 2000 gold pieces in value of the sacrificed fire opals. Vardaka is equipped with a strangely modified saddle, and she will allow a single being specified by you to ride her. Vardaka is an intelligent mount and follows the normal mounted combat rules for riding an intelligent creature. She will obey her rider\u2019s commands unless her frenzy ability specifies otherwise. Once you use this feature, you can\u2019t use it again until you complete a long rest. For complete stats on these creatures see Chapter V: Bestiary. Tsunami - the Mad King\u2019s Reluctant Final Boon This final boon of the Mad King is only asked of him by those as insane as the Mad King himself or those in the direst of predicaments. This ritual must be The Tiar of the Realm of the Swift Zephyrs (Osalikene) After his remarkable journey to the Realm of the Crushing Deep, Telas was emboldened to continue traveling to different realms in the hopes of finding some trace of the lost Eloran deities. Reviewing even more ancient ssanu documents left behind by their former scaled masters, he found mention of a place known as the Realm of the Swift Zephyrs. The term \u2018zephyrs\u2019 was one used by Lord Osalian when describing some of the denizens that existed in His domain and this spurred hope that he could find some trace of the elorii gods. Having already learned how to peel back the barriers that separate the Mortal Realm from others, Telas was soon transported to the Realm of the Swift Zephyrs and immediately found himself falling as if from a tremendous height. Struggling to tap down his rising panic, he quickly surveyed the area about him, and but for the deep lavender sky and quickly moving clouds, he saw nothing else. No land or ocean were within view and whatever he was falling towards must be so far below as to be invisible to his eye. Whether it was his presence or the strangled screams that escaped his lips, regardless of the efforts made to maintain control of his fears, large patches of pastel hued \u201cclouds\u201d seemed to form about him and slowed his descent. Within seconds, the archmage found himself upon a miraculously semi-solid cloudbank that stretched in all directions for what seemed to be leagues. At first Telas believed himself alone, but he soon noticed a portion of the air before him zipping and whizzing about him and a low buzzing nagged at his ears. Slowly, a form began to coalesce, though it still refused to remain in one place. \u201dCanyouunderstandusmw,creature?\u201d a voice asked from in front, to the side and then above him. Beginning to understand what was happening, Telas spoke as quickly as his mouth could form the words and still be intelligible. \u201cYes, though the people of my Realm do not move or speak as quickly as you do. Please slow down so that we may communicate. \u201d With great effort the multi- formed image merged into one, revealing a tall and slender entity of breathtaking beauty. Telas thought of the being as a \u201cher\u201d, though in fact the Zephyrs do not possess a gender. With great effort, his rescuer explained, in what must have been a glacially slow manner for her, that he was indeed in the Realm of the Swift Zephyrs and that he was at the outskirts of the domain of Tiar Sur\u2019hy of the Zephyrs; Tiar being some sort of honorific similar to a Lord or iMNg. Traveling on a mixture of solidified air and clouds, Telas eventually met with Tiar Sur\u2019hy who expressed astonishment at\u2003 discovering the elorii. Like the Mad King of the Crushing Deep, Sur\u2019hy possessed no knowledge of Holy Osalian. The Tiar explained that travel between the Realms was rare but not unheard of as they had had periodic contact with Lord Gorum and assisted him during the War. When Telas asked about the War, the Tiar became suspicious and the archmagi thought it best to change the subject. After negotiating a similar bargain for the Osalikene as he did for the Berokene, Telas resolved to gain an audience with Lord Gorum and his Realm of the Solid Sky. You have invoked the Ancient Pact with the Tiar of the Realm of the Swift Zephyrs. In return for gifts of diamonds, a rare commodity in the Tiar\u2019s realm, she is willing to send you aid. This connection has additionally channeled and influenced your arcane studies into focusing on your elemental bloodline\u2019s connection to the air. Expanded Sped List The Tiar of the Realm of the Swift Zephyrs lets you choose from an expanded list of spells when you learn an elder warlock spell. The following spells are added to the elder warlock spell list for you.

Boon of the Tiar of the Realm of the Swift Zephyrs Starting at 3 rd level, The Tiar of the Realm of the Swift Zephyrs has agreed to allow you to summon warriors from her realm. As an action, you may expend an elder warlock spell slot and sacrifice diamonds worth at least 10 gold pieces to summon a Zephyr Warrior, which appears in an unoccupied space next to you. The Zephyr Warrior is friendly to you and will disappear when it drops to 0 hit points, after it has served you for one hour, or if you dismiss it as an action. It will also disappear if it is successfully targeted by a casting of dispel magic (or a similar spell or effect) capable of dispelling a spell cast with your elder warlock spell slot. Until the Zephyr Warrior disappears, you cannot maintain concentration on any spell which conjures or summons a creature or creatures. The Zephyr Warrior will obey your verbal commands, requiring no action, so long as you share a language with it. If you issue no commands, then the Zephyr Warrior will attack any creature it sees which is obviously hostile to you. Once you use this feature, you can\u2019t use it again until you complete a long rest. The action used to activate this feature may be interrupted by counterspell as if it were a spell cast with your elder warlock spell slot, in which case the elder warlock spell slot is still expended but the diamonds are not sacrificed, and this feature is not considered to have been used. Starting at 6 th level, you may instead use this feature to summon a Slayer of the Steel Wind. If you do so, then the sacrificed diamonds must be worth at least 75 gold pieces. Starting at 14 th level, you may instead use this feature to summon an Aeromancer from the Realm of the Swift Zephyrs. If you do so, then the sacrificed diamonds must be worth at least 200 gold pieces.

You gain immunity to thunder damage and resistance to lightning damage. If you were already resistant to lightning damage, then you instead gain immunity.

The Tiar\u2019s Favored Pet Starting at 20 th level, the Tiar has favored you by allowing the summoning of her favorite pet, Granbeier the Bearded Vulture. So long as you are adjacent to a space large enough to contain it, as an action you may sacrifice diamonds worth at least 2000 gold pieces to summon Granbeier, who appears in a space adjacent to you. Granbeier is friendly to you and your allies and obeys your commands as if you were the Tiar herself. It will disappear when it drops to 0 hit points or after it has served you for 10 minutes for every 2000 gold pieces in value of the sacrificed diamonds. So long as it was not dropped to 0 hit points, it will demand its own payment for its services ten minutes before it vanishes. It asks you to provide it with carrion flesh equivalent to four medium creatures or one large creature. If you do not do so, then you must succeed on a DC 30 Charisma (Persuasion) check to convince Granbeier to leave without its reward. If you fail this roll and cannot provide the carrion it has demanded, then Granbeier will attack you and attempt to claim you for its meal before it vanishes. Once you use this feature, you can\u2019t use it again until you complete a long rest. For complete stats on these creatures see Chapter V: Bestiary. Hurricane - the Tiar\u2019s Reluctant Final Boon The Tiar will only grant this boon if she is convinced that the need is dire. Once granted, she sends a score of the most powerful and vicious air elementals, known as the Storm Furies, to the area directed by the summoner and allows them to unleash their might. Use of this rite should be given the utmost consideration as the vast storm summoned will not discriminate between friend and foe. Approximately fifty years ago, during the latter part of the Coryani Civil War, a deadly and destructive hurricane crashed upon the shores of Cafela and the city of Sweet Savona. The city was engaged in repelling invading forces when it was devastated by the storm as well. Between the casualties inflicted by the hurricane and the warring factions, Sweet Savona suffered the greatest loss of life of any battle of the Civil War. Some learned magi believe that the storm was a manifestation of this\u2003 rite, so quickly did it materialize, but evidence to substantiate these claims was never discovered. You may enact this terrible ritual within 5 miles of your target by spending 15 minutes in uninterrupted incantation and sacrificing your life and your soul. Once payment is made and the final words of intonation are uttered, a gentle breeze begins to blow in from the horizon. Within minutes, the wind grows to a deafening howl, and it continues to grow into a hurricane that covers 20 square miles. Although most effective if used on a coastal region, the rite can create a devastating storm in any locale or time of year. For example, if used in a mountainous region during the winter, the storm will manifest as a brutal blizzard. The conjured storm covers a large area, easily big enough to envelop a large city and its environs. The targeted area is wracked by hurricane force winds (sustained winds or gusts in excess of 118 km/h, 74 mph), lightning strikes, and torrential rains. If the targeted area is a coastal one, then ocean surges in the range of ten to twenty feet can flood the area as well. Most wooden structures will be utterly destroyed, and unsheltered people and animals will be swept away; their shattered bodies found many miles away, if ever found at all. Buildings and other structures made of solid stone should survive the storm intact, but widespread damage and loss of life is likely even so. Anything and anyone in the area of the storm will be crushed by flying debris and their remains carried off as a massive gale purges almost everything from the land. The gamemaster should estimate that the effects of the storm will destroy anything not made from stone and will kill anyone not sheltered in such a structure in a ten square mile area. You may only use this feature if you have learned in\u00acplay the secret of speaking the Kurenthe curse. The use of this feature kills you and destroys your essence to fuel its power, and your death in this manner may not be mitigated or undone by anything short of direct, divine intervention. At the gamemaster\u2019s discretion, the Tiar of the Realm of the Zephyrs may refuse to grant this boon or may ask an additional sacrifice or service before granting it. Lord Gorum of the Realm of the Solid Sky (Marokene) The transition from the Realm of the Swift Zephyrs to the Realm of the Solid Sky was a relatively easy one given that Tiar Sur\u2019hy and Lord Gorum appear to maintain cordial, if infrequent diplomatic relations monolithic giant tried to keep up with his answers. \u201cWe walk upon the Path of the Ten Thousand, Thousand Steps, which connects the entrance to Lord Gorum\u2019s Realm with the ramparts. These crumbling walls and Lord Gorum\u2019s Sentinels all are that stand between the structured order of the universe, as set by the Creator, and pure Chaos, which seeks to undo His great works. \u201d The inquisitive elorii\u2019s questions appeared to tax the monolith\u2019s patience for it fell silent, as its massive stride chewed the distance to the entry to the Realm of the Solid Sky. Its final words were, \u201cLord Gorum will answer all of your questions, incessant one. \u201d The distance that they walked did not seem to bring them any closer to their destination, and after a time, Falladrin consented to carry the fragile mage along the way. Exhausted, the archmage fell in a deep meditative trace sometime during their passage for when he awoke, he lay on a cobblestone floor. Cursing himself for his frailty, Telas quickly jumped to his feet. It was then that he noticed the gargantuan foot that was before him. He turned his gaze upward but was only able to see up to the being\u2019s knees before the rest was lost in the darkness. Suddenly, the portion of the floor upon which he stood shot upward, forcing him again to his knees. Within moments, he was before a face the size of the largest towers that once adorned Bright Belestor. \u201cI have adjusted the pressure of my Realm so as not to cause you discomfort, elorii. Have I misjudged your physical needs?\u201d Rising to his feet, Telas bowed deeply. \u201cNot at all, Lord Gorum. L merely fell to my knees to better show my deference to your majesty. \u201d What at first Telas thought was a being seated upon a stone throne, was instead one entire creature; in fact, Telas began to wonder if the entire realm was but one complete sentient entity. As he observed, there seemed not to be a place where Lord Gorum ended and the throne began. He further noticed that the \u201cthrone\u201d flowed directly from the floor and wall as if the \u201cLord Gorum\u201d he saw was only a manifestation for his benefit. Telas began to form the theory that Lord Gorum and the Realm of the Solid Sky were one. Feeling that airing his hypothesis might be rude and detrimental to his health, Telas instead asked about the chaos that Falladrin mentioned. \u201cKnow you so little of the Creation, little elorii?\u201d Asked Gorum. \u201cWhen the Creator brought light to the darkness, He first\u2003 needed to bring into existence the essence of Chaos, the building blocks of Order. From this vast store of potential, the Creator crafted everything we see, hear, andfeel. He molded Order from Chaos, but some of this ever-changing mass was left over \u2014 unused. \u201cAnd now this remnant seeks to break down all that was created and begin anew, in a never-ending cycle of conception and destruction until perfection is achieved. Or so the creatures of chaos we have been able to capture tells us. Somehow, within the maelstrom sea of pandemonium, intelligence has emerged, slaves to the concept that what the Creator has made is imperfect and impure, requiring it to break us down to our constituent bits. The creatures of Chaos believe we embody stagnation and that we stand in the way of perfection. With creatures that are beholden to such a philosophy there can be no negotiation\u2026 no compromise. \u201cAnd so, like all the other Lord Gorum before me, Ifollow the instructions of the Creator and hold this bulwark against the sea of Chaos that assaults us. Now andforever more, we are the Guardians of Order, the Protectors of Life, and should we fail, all will be consumed. \u201d Time passed with Telas asking much about this War with Chaos and the form that their agents take. He came to know much of them and additionally learned of another, even greater threat known as Oblivion, but of that Lord Gorum knew but whispers. Yet as knowledgeable as the monolithic monarch of this realm seemed to be, he knew nothing of mighty Marok or any of the other gods, though he did point the archmage to the Realm of the Burnished Flame, a place where entities similar to Lord Keleos dwelled. Again, Telas negotiated a similar pact between Lord Gorum and his people and any Marokene elorii that were versed in elemental sorcery. At first Lord Gorum\u2019s request for the nuts and seedlings of trees such as the oak and redwoods puzzled the archmage, until he remembered those thick ropelike roots that wove in and out of the ramparts he first saw. These seedlings were planted deep within the barrier and reinforced it just like the roots of trees keep the earth from washing away. Bidding his host farewell, Telos traveled to the realm that held the greatest promise of finding a sign of the lost deities. You have invoked the Ancient Pact with Lord Gorum of the Realm of the Solid Sky. In return for gifts of nuts and seedlings from monumental trees, a rare commodity Lord Gorum requires for the defense of his realm, he is willing to send you aid. This connection has additionally channeled and influenced your arcane studies into focusing on your elemental bloodline\u2019s connection to the stone. Expanded Spell List Lord Gorum lets you choose from an expanded list of spells when you learn an elder warlock spell. The following spells are added to the elder warlock spell list for you. Spells marked with f are found in the Arcanis 5e Campaign Setting and spells marked with a * are new spells found later in the Chapter IV: Elder Magic of Arcanis. LORD GORUM OF THE REALM OF THE SOLID SKY EXPANDED SPELL LIST 1 st Earth spikes*, longstrider 2 nd Earth shieldf, spike growth 3 rd Meld into stone, slow 4 th Stone shape, wrath of stone\u2019 5 th Creation, wall of stone 6 th Flesh to stone, move earth 8 th Earthquake Elemental Familiar Starting at 1 st level, your bond with Lord Gorum allows you to summon creatures from his realm. You learn find familiar as an additional elder warlock spell known, which does not count against your total elder warlock spells known. Any time you summon a familiar, its type changes to elemental regardless of its form. Your familiar gains the following traits: \u2022 Regardless of the form it takes, your familiar seems to be made of dust and stone. \u2022 It gains a burrow speed equal to the highest speed listed on its stat-block, or it may add +10 feet to an existing burrow-speed. \u2022 It loses any fly Speed it may have had. \u2022 It can burrow through non-magical, unworked earth and stone. While doing so, it doesn\u2019t disturb the material it moves through. It is resistant to acid damage. It is vulnerable to lightning damage and thunder damage. Elemental blast Starting at 1 st level, you learn the elemental blast cantrip, which does not count against your total elder warlock cantrips known. It deals your choice of acid or bludgeoning damage chosen at the time of casting. The beams of energy are made of stone and quicksilver. Boon of the Lord of the Realm of the Solid Sky Starting at 3 rd level, Lord Gorum has agreed to allow you to summon warriors from his realm. As an action, you may expend an elder warlock spell slot and sacrifice rare seedlings worth at least 10 gold pieces to summon a Warrior of Jehelka, which appears in an unoccupied space next to you. The Warrior of Jehelka is friendly to you and will disappear when it drops to 0 hit points, after it has served you for one hour, or if you dismiss it as an action. It will also disappear if it is successfully targeted by a casting of dispel magic (or a similar spell or effect) capable of dispelling a spell cast with your elder warlock spell slot. Until the Warrior of Jehelka disappears, you cannot maintain concentration on any spell which conjures or summons a creature or creatures. The Warrior of Jehelka will obey your verbal, requiring no action, so long as you share a language with it. If you issue no commands, then the Warrior of Jehelka will attack any creature it sees which is obviously hostile to you. Once you use this feature, you can\u2019t use it again until you complete long rest. The action used to activate this feature may be interrupted by counterspell as if it were a spell cast with your elder warlock spell slot, in which case the elder warlock spell slot is still expended but the rare seedlings are not sacrificed, and this feature is not considered to have been used. Starting at 6 th level, you may instead use this feature to summon a Monolithic Juggernaut. If you do so, then the sacrificed rare seedlings must be worth at least 75 gold pieces. Starting at 14 th level, you may instead use this feature to summon a Terramancer from the Realm of the Solid Sky. If you do so, then the sacrificed rare seedlings must be worth at least 200 gold pieces. Grounding of the Solid Sky Starting at 6 th level, your connection to the Realm of the Solid Sky has fortified you against that which is anathema to your elemental nature and the nature of Lord Gorum\u2019s realm. You gain resistance to lightning damage. Blessing of the Solid Sky Starting at 10 th level, your connection to the Realm of the Solid Sky has enhanced your natural resistance to acid to fortify you against the nature of Lord Gorum\u2019s realm. You gain immunity to acid damage. Improved Pact Ritual Starting at 14 th level, you may expend an elder warlock spell slot to use the Boon of the Lord of the Realm of the Solid Sky feature a second time before completing a long rest. Lord Gorum\u2019s Fierce Ally Starting at 20 th level, Lord Gorum has favored you by allowing the summoning of his fierce ally, the Colossus of Jehelka, a being so powerful that on its world it is worshipped as a god. So long as you are adjacent to a space large enough to contain it, as an action you may sacrifice rare seedlings worth at least 2000 gold pieces to summon the Colossus, who appears in a space adjacent to you. Care must be taken when calling upon the Colossus as it is a relentless force upon the battlefield. As part of the action used to summon the Colossus, you must identify the foes you would like destroyed. The Colossus will go on a rampage and not stop until it has completed the task required of it; it will not care what collateral damage it causes along the way or if non-combatants or allies are inadvertently wounded in its attacks. Once given a directive, the Colossus cannot be dismissed, recalled, or ordered to cease its attacks. It will return to its native realm once it has been reduced to 0 hit points, all the identified enemies have been vanquished, or an amount of time has passed equal to 10 minutes per 2000 gold pieces worth of rare seedlings sacrificed, whichever comes first. Once you use this feature, you can\u2019t use it again until you complete a long rest. For complete stats on these creatures see Chapter V: Bestiary. Earthquake - Lord Gorum\u2019s Reluctant Final Boon Lord Gorum is loath to grant this ritual as its effect is more akin to the devastation wrought by the forces of Chaos that he battles, than the stability and order, which he extols. Nevertheless, if the need is great and the cause just in his eyes, the Lord of the Realm of the Solid Sky will allow the invoker to wield its power. This rite, like the equivalent spells from the other realms, should be used with great care and judiciously as it is capable of causing great loss of life and destruction of property. One need only look to Fallen Illian, the first city built by the humans after their conquest of blessed Belestor, to see the spell\u2019s capacity to inflict utter ruin upon those within its affected area, for that ill-fated city was swallowed whole by the very earth. The elder sorcerer responsible for the attack was a member of those who would one day call themselves Malfelan, who felt that a natural catastrophe of such a great magnitude would allow his fellow elorii to move unmolested out of the Vastwood. Unfortunately, the human sorcerers had mastered their crude manipulation of the arcane energies and discovered who and what had caused the earthquake. They fell upon those elorii traveling south with a great vengeance and slaughtered thousands of them. The surviving elorii who made it to the shelter of the southern forest called it a victory, for they had slain over fifty thousand humans, but none have ever called upon Lord Gorum\u2019s boon ever since. You may enact this terrible ritual within 5 miles of your target by spending 15 minutes in uninterrupted incantation and sacrificing your life and your soul. Once payment is made and the final words of intonation are uttered, a massive rumbling can be felt roiling through the earth. The rite may be cast in any geographic location, though side effects such as tidal waves may occur if cast near a coastal region or at sea, while torrents of magma may erupt upward if in a volcanic region. At first a small rumbling may be felt, followed swiftly by a tremor, which can cause anything not heavy enough or tied down to topple. To those knowledgeable in earth magic, the tremor may give them enough warning to flee the affected area if they are quick enough. Within a few minutes after the tremor, the ground will begin to shake violently, the solid ground appearing to be transformed into an undulating sea. These shockwaves will destroy all but the strongest of constructions, which will suffer some sort of structural damage unless magically protected. The ground will then begin to crack and shatter, possibly swallowing large swaths of land and entombing them underground. Anything touching the ground within 10 miles of the earthquake\u2019s epicenter is destroyed as buildings collapse, fissures open, and the very ground liquefies beneath the feet of the hapless beings unlucky enough to be within range of the dev .IM a ion. You may only use this feature if you have learned in\u00acplay the secret of speaking the Kurenthe curse. The use of this feature kills you and destroys your essence to fuel its power, and your death in this manner may not be mitigated or undone by anything short of direct, divine intervention. At the gamemaster\u2019s discretion, Lord Gorum may refuse to grant this boon or may ask an additional sacrifice or service before granting it. The Sheykh of the Realm of the Burnished Flame (Kelekene) By Lord Gorum\u2019s leave, his Prime Counsel opened a small breach within their nigh-impenetrable defenses to the Realm of the Burnished Flame. Transitioning through the rift in space, Telos soon found himself in a world that appeared to be in its death throes; huge eruptions of molten rock leapt hundreds of feet into the air and the sky itself was thick with banks of sulfur and soot. Strangely, the elorii archmage felt invigorated and quite at home in the churning inferno. Looking about, Telos found that he stood on a rocky shore and what appeared to be a paved road was but a few feet from his position. The ambient heat, which strangely felt soothing upon his flesh, made objects in\u2003 the distance waver as if a mirage, but he could make out an immense metropolis rising majestically on the horizon. As he made his way to the city, he noted strange balls of flame rolling past, whizzing this way and that. After observing them for a while, Telos realized that the fire balls were creatures made of living flame and their strange movements was because of the small, almost invisible metallic insects which they hunted and consumed. His journey took the elorii past fields littered with shards of sharp obsidian and thick layers of ash from that rose from what appeared to be petrified trees of enormous proportions. As he traveled closer, the city took on a sharper image: a huge wall surrounded buildings that were a mix of neck-bending towers, blocky structures that just peeked over the wall, and other buildings topped by minarets. He later came to understand that the inhabitants of the city, whose name was Milshara, the Burnished City of Brass, were a varied lot. Some had a stony appearance with bright tongues of flame licking out of the various joints, while others were of a more metallic hue, with the same tell-tale licks of flame. After a short amount of time within their midst, Telos came to understand that the indigenous inhabitants of this realm were beings of living flame. The appearances that they affected were to them what clothing was to the beings living upon Arcanis. Unlike clothing, however, the lords of this place dictated what form one could assume, which was predicated upon one\u2019s duties and social standing. It was not long before the elorii\u2019s presence was brought to the attention of the ruling caste. Living flames encased in elaborate and highly stylized armor accosted him and brought him forth to the Palace of Incandescence, forcing him to kneel before a large throne made of gleaming brass or bronze. Shortly thereafter, a regal being of smoldering, red flesh appeared and sat on the throne, instantly followed by others of his kind. Telos was informed that he was in the presence of the immortal Sheykh Andalsanna of the Shaitan Empire and was ordered to explain what he was and why he had trespassed upon his city uninvited. What followed were the most harrowing and enlightening hours of conversation that the archmage had ever experienced. He discovered that these Shaitan lorded over an immense empire that spanned many conquered realms, including the one which he now stood upon. The home realm of the empire was core ward and was a place that hovered near the pure realm where only heat and fire existed. When asked if the Sheykh had heard of his God, Keleos, Telos was told such a devastating and terrible story that the archmage was shocked mute for several minutes. What Telos was told that day, he never related to anyone during his short return to\u2003 Arcanis. Those who saw him said that he looked an empty shell of man, with haunted eyes and a face that looked as if it were incapable of ever smiling again. What the archmage did say was that he had bargained with the Sheykh and he would serve him for one- thousand and one years, as they recorded time in exchange of ensuring that no other elorii would ever be taught the way to travel to the other realms. However, the archmage did not want his own people to be denied the same access to powers that he had acquired for the other elorii and so a final sorcerous pact was made between the Kelekene who had mastered elemental sorcery and the Shaitan of the Realm of the Burnished Flame. Bidding his people a final farewell, the archmage Telos disappeared one last time and though many have awaited his return, he has never been seen again. You have invoked the Ancient Pact with the Sheykh of the Realm of the Burnished Flame. In return for gifts of black pearls, a rare commodity in his realm, he is willing to send you aid. This connection has additionally channeled and influenced your arcane studies into focusing on your elemental bloodline\u2019s connection to fire. Expanded Sped List The Sheykh lets you choose from an expanded list of spells when you learn an elder warlock spell. The following spells are added to the elder warlock spell list for you. Spells marked with f are found in the Arcanis 5e Campaign Setting and spells marked with a * are new spells found later in the Chapter IV: Elder Magic of Arcanis.

You learn find familiar as an additional elder warlock spell known, which does not count against your total elder warlock spells known. Any time you summon a familiar, its type changes to elemental regardless of its form. Your familiar gains the following traits: \u2022 Regardless of the form it takes, your familiar seems to be made of living flame. \u2022 It can move through a space as narrow as 1 inch wide without squeezing. \u2022 It can choose to shed bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. \u2022 It is resistant to fire damage and vulnerable to cold damage. Elemental blast Starting at 1 st level, you learn the elemental blast cantrip, which does not count against your total elder warlock cantrips known. It deals fire damage. Boon of the Sheykh of the Realm of the Burnished Flame Starting at 3 rd level, the Sheykh of the Realm of the Burnished Flame has agreed to allow you to summon warriors from his realm. As an action, you may expend an elder warlock spell slot and sacrifice black pearls worth at least 10 gold pieces to summon a Blazing Archer of Milshara, which appears in an unoccupied space next to you. The Blazing Archer of Milshara is friendly to you and will disappear when it drops to 0 hit points, after it has served you for one hour, or if you dismiss it as an action. It will also disappear if it is successfully targeted by a casting of dispel magic (or a similar spell or effect) capable of dispelling a spell cast with your elder warlock spell slot. Until the Blazing Archer of Milshara disappears, you cannot maintain concentration on any spell that conjures or summons a creature or creatures. The Blazing Archer of Milshara will obey your verbal commands, requiring no action, so long as you share a language with it. If you issue no commands, then the Blazing Archer of Milshara will attack any creature it sees, which is obviously hostile to you. Once you use this feature, you can\u2019t use it again until you complete long rest. The action used to activate this feature may be interrupted by counterspell as if it were a spell cast with your elder warlock spell slot, in which case the elder warlock spell slot is still expended but the black pearls are not sacrificed, and this feature is not considered to have been used. Starting at 6 th level, you may instead use this feature to summon a Molten Tiger. If you do so, then the sacrificed black pearls must be worth at least 75 gold pieces. Starting at 14 th level, you may instead use this feature to summon a Pyromancer from the Realm of the Burnished Flame. If you do so, then the sacrificed black pearls must be worth at least 200 gold pieces. Fortitude of the Burnished Flame Starting at 6 th level, your connection to the realm of the Burnished Flame has fortified you against that which is anathema to your elemental nature and the nature of the Sheykh\u2019s realm. You gain resistance to cold damage. Blessing of the Burnished Flame Starting at 10 th level, your connection to the realm of the Burnished Flame has enhanced your natural resistance to acid to fortify you against the nature of the Sheykh\u2019s realm. You gain immunity to fire damage. Improved Pact Ritual Starting at 14 th level, you may expend an elder warlock spell slot to use the Boon of the Sheykh of the Realm of the Burnished Flame feature a second time before completing a long rest. The Sheykh\u2019s Ancient Friend Starting at 20 th level, the Sheykh has favored you by allowing the summoning of his friend, Exurapas the Flaming Phoenix, believed by many denizens of the fire aligned Inner Realms to be the creator of all. So long as you are adjacent to a space large enough to contain it, as an action you may sacrifice black pearls worth at least 2000 gold pieces to summon Exurapas, who appears in a space adjacent to you. Care must be taken when calling upon Exurapas as it is a nigh-uncontrollable force of destruction. Once it appears, Exurapas will attack all living things in the immediate area, excluding only you. As an action, you may attempt a DC 25 Charisma (Persuasion) check to convince Exurapas to spare your allies. It will return to its native realm once it is reduced to 0 hit points, an amount of time has passed equal to 10 minutes per 2000 gold pieces worth of black pearls sacrificed, it has extinguished the lives of all detectable living creatures aside from those it has been convinced to spare, or you use an action to send it home. Once you use this feature, you can\u2019t use it again until you complete a long rest. For complete stats on these creatures see Chapter V: Bestiary. Storm of Fire - the Sheykh\u2019s Final Boon Of all the Lords of the Inner Realms encountered by Telos, only the Sheykh is happy to grant a final boon such as this. The reason is that while the boon granted is a devastating rain of fire, it is accomplished by sending thousands of lesser elementals to the elder warlock\u2019s realm and allowing them free reign in spreading destruction throughout that land. In essence, each time the Storm of Fire ritual is enacted, it acts as a small invasion by the Realm of the Burnished Sky, to what end, only the Sheykh knows. It is said that fire is a living thing, running rampant, consuming all that is in its path, breathing and growing until finally dying out. It is for this reason that pyromancers, more than any other elemental sorcerers, must take utmost care and exert unrivaled control over their flames, for once the fire has been summoned, unlike earth, air, or water, it will strain to be free, struggling to consume and grow without restraint. To date, there has never been a need so great that a Kelekene has seen the need to call down this torrent of flame. Even the Malfelan, long known to take extreme\u2003 action against their foes, have not resorted to this measure. You may enact this terrible ritual within five miles of your target by spending 15 minutes in uninterrupted incantation and sacrificing your life and your soul. Once payment is made and the final words of intonation are uttered, your sacrifice causes an unnatural storm to begin to form above a targeted region covering 10 square miles. Shattering thunder and weirdly greenish bolts of lightning presage the coming of the storm, but unlike those that Lord Hurrian commands, this storm unleashes sheets of fire. The flames ignite any flammable material in the initial area, incinerating wooden structures in minutes. The air grows so hot that it causes any mortal breathing it to literally burn from the inside out. Anyone in the immediate area caught outside of shelter will be incinerated. Stone buildings will afford some small measure of protection, but eventually the heat will increase to the point that the very walls will glow and anyone trapped inside will be cooked alive as if they were within an oven. The storm of fire will initially destroy everything in a ten-mile radius. The fire ignited by the ritual will continue to burn wildly for so long as there is fuel for it to consume. The one thing in the defenders\u2019 favor is that the flames summoned by the spell are ultimately of a mundane nature and can be extinguished by normal means: water, fire lines, lack of oxygen, etc. This may be a small consolation as the raging inferno covers such a large area that those seeking to put it out may have no recourse but to let the fires burn themselves out. You may only use this feature if you have learned in\u00acplay the secret of speaking the Kurenthe curse. The use of this feature kills you and destroys your essence to fuel its power, and your death in this manner may not be mitigated or undone by anything short of direct, divine intervention. At the gamemaster\u2019s discretion, the Sheykh may refuse to grant this boon or may ask an additional sacrifice or service before granting it. The Plant Lords (Ardakene) Hearing of the woeful tale of the archmage Telos, Mendros, a Life Warden of great power and knowledge, saw the benefit of forging such sorcerous pacts with other great powers, but also saw the folly of trucking with beings not of this world. Though forbidden by his elders, the young Life Warden decided that the benefits to his people far outweighed the dangers he would face or the censure that might be voices rung out, \u201cWe have decided that you speak from the heart and true. Regrettably, we cannot help you as we do not know where the Mother hides herself though we know that she still lives and is within our realm. \u201d \u201cWho are you that you would know this?\u201d Mendros asked. A rumbling ensued that the Life Warden was startled to realize was their form of laughter. \u201cWe are Her first. This sacred place was where the Mother, Belisarda, awakened. So full of joy, She shared the gift of sentience with those about Her and so awakened us and gave us the ability to realize that we \u2018were\u2019. Over time, our roots have grown strong and connected with others of our kind that have not awakened, but nonetheless are aware of what is about them. From that web of life, we know that She still lives somewhere among us, but hides Herself As great and vast as our power is, Hers is greater. We cannot find Her. \u201d Mendros stayed among these Plant Lords, as he came to call them, for they had no need of names amongst themselves, and lived for a long while upon this island continent that had birthed the Life Mother. While beautiful with all sorts of plants and flowers that were unknown or extinct elsewhere upon Arcanis, this land was also fraught with danger as nature had run amok here, creating some of the most exotic and dangerous creatures he had ever encountered. After a lifetime of learning and communing with these primordial beings, Mendros decided to take his leave and return to Elonbe. Before he left, he made arrangements whereby other Ardakene may call upon them. Pacts were made and sworn on that day. As part of the agreement, Mendros was tasked with taking small saplings, progeny of the Plant Lords, and planting them on the soil of the different continents. The last two he planted within the sacred grove in Elonbe. You have invoked the Ancient Pact with the Plant Lords. In return for gifts of fervidite, a rare commodity, the Plant Lords require for unknown reasons, they are willing to send you aid. This connection has additionally channeled and influenced your arcane studies into focusing on your elemental bloodline\u2019s connection to life and nature. Expanded Spell List The Plant Lords let you choose from an expanded list of spells when you learn an elder warlock spell. The following spells are added to the elder warlock spell list for you. Spells marked with f are found in the Arcanis 5e Campaign Setting and spells marked with a * are new spells found later in the Chapter IV: Elder Magic of Arcanis. Calling Upon the Green Starting at 1 st level, your bond to the Plant Lords allows you to summon creatures made from the essence of life and nature. Any time you cast a spell or use an ability that allows you to conjure or summon a creature of the elemental type, you may instead conjure or summon a creature of the Plant type with a challenge rating equal to or lower than the challenge rating of the elemental normally conjured or summoned by the spell or ability. For example, you may conjure a shambling mound by casting conjure elemental. Additionally, starting at 1 st level, you learn find familiar as an additional elder warlock spell known, which does not count against your total elder warlock spells known. Any time you summon a familiar, its type changes to Plant regardless of its form. Your familiar gains the following traits: \u2022 Regardless of the form taken its coloration is always deep green with emerald green eyes. \u2022 Its coloration grants it advantage on all Dexterity (Stealth) checks when within natural foliage of the same color. Elemental blast Starting at 1 st level, you learn the elemental blast cantrip, which does not count against your total elder warlock cantrips known. It deals your choice of slashing or radiant damage, chosen at the time of casting. The beams of energy are made of a\u2003 combination of spectral vines and pure life energy. Additionally, anytime you would drop a creature\u2019s hit point total to 0 with elemental blast, you may choose to have them automatically succeed at their death saving throw, stabilizing at 0 hit points, even if the damage done would normally kill them. Boon of the Plant Lords Starting at 3 rd level, the Plant Lords have agreed to send protectors to watch over you when needed. As an action, you may expend an elder warlock spell slot and sacrifice fervidite worth at least 10 gold pieces to summon a Protector of the Green, which appears in an unoccupied space next to you. The Protector of the Green is friendly to you and will disappear when it drops to 0 hit points, after it has served you for one hour, or if you dismiss it as an action. It will also disappear if it is successfully targeted by a casting of dispel magic (or a similar spell or effect) capable of dispelling a spell cast with your elder warlock spell slot. Until the Protector of the Green disappears, you cannot maintain concentration on any spell that conjures or summons a creature or creatures. The Protector of the Green will obey your verbal commands, requiring no action, so long as you share a language with it. If you issue no commands, then the Protector of the Green will attack any creature it sees that is obviously hostile to you. The action used to activate this feature may be interrupted by counterspell as if it were a spell cast with your elder warlock spell slot, in which case the elder warlock spell slot is still expended but the fervidite is not sacrificed and this feature is not considered to have been used. Once you use this feature, you can\u2019t use it again until you complete long rest. Starting at 6 th level, you may instead use this feature to summon a Champion of the Heartwood. If you do so, then the sacrificed fervidite must be worth at least 75 gold pieces. Starting at 14 th level, you may instead use this feature to summon an Arbormancer of the Plant Lords. If you do so, then the sacrificed fervidite must be worth at least 200 gold pieces. Fortitude of the Plant Lords Starting at 6 th level, your connection to the pure life web of the Plant Lords has fortified your life energy. You gain advantage on death saving throws, and you gain resistance to radiant damage. Blessing of the Plant Lords Starting at 10 th level, your connection to the pure life web of the Plant Lords has further enhanced your life energy. You gain resistance to necrotic damage. If you are already resistant to necrotic damage or later become so from another source, then you instead become immune to necrotic damage. Improved Pact Ritual Starting at 14 th level, you may expend an elder warlock spell slot to use the Boon of the Plant Lords feature a second time before completing a long rest. Belisarda\u2019s First Children Starting at 20 th level, one of the greatest of the Plant Lords will personally heed your call to aid. Kratae, the Great Hawthorne, once a sapling offshoot of the first tree that sprang to life under Belisarda\u2019s love, is tasked to come to the aid of those who call through the life web. So long as you are adjacent to a space of bare earth or unworked stone large enough to contain it, as an action you may sacrifice fervidite worth at least 2000 gold pieces to summon Kratae, who appears in a space adjacent to you. Kratae is friendly to you and your allies, and it will generally follow any requests you make. It is a proud and ancient being, however, and will refuse to follow any direct orders or commands given to it. Kratae will also automatically seek to heal any living creature that is making death saving throws. Kratae will become hostile to anyone, including you and your allies, who kills any living thing within its sight. If someone successfully kills a living creature, then Kratae will make every attempt to knock that person unconscious and return to the Realm of the Plant Lords with the offender, keeping them imprisoned until they complete enough acts of penitence to appease Kratae. Kratae will return to its native realm once it is reduced to 0 hit points, an amount of time has passed equal to 10 minutes per 2000 gold pieces worth of fervidite sacrificed, or you use an action to send it home. You cannot use an action to send Kratae home if he is hostile to you or one of your allies. Once you use this feature, you can\u2019t use it again until you complete a long rest. For complete stats on these creatures see Chapter V: Bestiary.\u2003 The Green - the Plant Lords\u2019 Reluctant Final Boon Though reluctant to grant the following boon, the Plant Lords can be convinced that the unleashing of destructive forces is justified against those who threaten the balance of life itself. All things return to earth from whence it came. All living things follow this immutable law and even those things made from nonliving material must bow to the inevitable. The landscape of Arcanis is strewn with the bleached bones of fallen empires, crumbled kingdoms, and the ashes of monuments, though it can take many years, centuries, or even millennia for nature to reclaim what was once hers. This ritual accelerates the natural processes, calling upon the vibrant force of life to breakdown and reabsorbs anything and everything in its path. The Green is nature run amok; inexorable and undiscriminating of anything within its reach. Plant shoots erupt through feet of concrete or wood, constricting and crushing whatever is within its tendrils. Any living materials, from animals to sentient beings, are violently absorbed into the green mass; drowning them in a sea of foliage. The tallest of towers will be toppled, the thickest walls rent, and whatever blemish was made upon the earth shall be expunged, leaving behind a virgin landscape of a primordial forest. You may enact this terrible ritual within five miles of your target by spending 15 minutes in uninterrupted incantation and sacrificing your life and your soul. Once payment is made and the final words of intonation are uttered, a large, primordial forest quickly grows in the area. Seemingly ancient plants sprout from the earth in a matter of moments, transforming the area into a lush, verdant paradise. All buildings and man-made structures in the area are slowly, but relentlessly destroyed as they are torn apart by massive roots, vines, and limbs. Even living creatures in the area are not spared as they choke on pollen or are strangled by fast-moving vines. Others affected by the ritual itself are absorbed into the Green, their Eldritch Sorcerer \u00b6 Arcane magic taps into the residual energy of Creation to achieve miraculous and often mind-bending effects. This gives these ancient practitioners mastery over such exotic effects as creating an object out of thin air, changing the very essence of one thing to another, or tapping directly into the raw building blocks of reality (such as the Elemental Planes). The Eldritch Tradition is the magic used by most of the younger races of Arcanis, such as humanity and ss\u2019ressen. Like the Elder Tradition, eldritch sorcerers funnel the residual power of Creation through themselves, channeling it to perform a desired effect through sheer force of will. To illuminate the differences, masters of the Eldritch Tradition explain to their students that elder sorcerers are able to form and maintain a long equation, manipulate it, and even complete it, all without the help of paper and stylus. An eldritch sorcerer can formulate the equation in their mind, manipulate it to a point, but then has to estimate the answer. If Elder sorcery is a scalpel, then the Eldritch Tradition is a sledgehammer. Class Features \u00b6 As an eldritch sorcerer, you gain the following class features: Race Restrictions \u00b6 Races with the Elder Spellcaster racial feature, dwarves (With the exception of the Encali), and male ss\u2019ressen can not take levels in this class. Hit Points \u00b6 Hit Dice: 1d6 per eldritch sorcerer level Hit Points at 1 st Level: 6 + your Constitution modifier Hit Points at Higher Levels: 1d6 (or 4) + your Constitution modifier per Eldritch Sorcerer level after 1 st level Proficiencies \u00b6 Armor: None Weapons: Daggers, darts, slings, quarterstaffs, light crossbows Tools: None Saving Throws: Constitution, Charisma Skills: Choose two from Arcana, Deception, Insight, Intimidation, Persuasion, Religion, and Stealth Equipment \u00b6 You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background: See Chapter IV for regional weapons and armor. If you choose a weapon with ammunition you start with 20 bolts or arrows or 10 shots of blast powder. * Choose any two weapons you are proficient with from your starting nation. Choose either a component pouch or an arcane focus. Choose either a scholar\u2019s pack or an explorer\u2019s pack. Hunted by Ymandragore \u00b6 The Sorcerer-King of Ymandragore hunts all arcane spellcasters. Displaying one\u2019s sorcerous skills openly or in a public setting is a sure way to end one\u2019s career early. Spellcasting \u00b6 By absorbing and repurposing the energy of Creation, you can cast spells and make your will into reality. Cantrips \u00b6 At 1 st level, you know two cantrips of your choice from the eldritch sorcerer spell list. You learn additional cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Eldritch Sorcerer table. Spell Slots \u00b6 The Eldritch Sorcerer table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1 st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell\u2019s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest. For example, if you know the 1 st level spell burning hands and have a 1 st level and a 2 nd level spell slot available, you can cast burning hands using either slot.

The Spells Known column of the Eldritch Sorcerer table shows when you learn more eldritch sorcerer spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 3 rd level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1 st or 2 nd level. Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the eldritch sorcerer spells you know and replace it with another spell from the eldritch sorcerer spell List, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots. Spellcasting Ability \u00b6 Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your eldritch sorcerer spells, since the power of your magic relies on your ability to project your will into the world. You use Charisma for determining your attack roll and saving throw DC with your eldritch sorcerer spells, and for anything that involves your spellcasting ability. Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + our Charisma modifier Spell Save DC = 8 + your Charisma modifier + your proficiency bonus Eldritch Ritual Spellcasting \u00b6 You can cast any eldritch sorcerer spell you know as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag. You have developed several shortcuts that allow you to cast your rituals with a form of arcane shorthand. You only require 5 minutes to cast a ritual spell. Spellcasting Focus \u00b6 You can use an arcane focus as a spellcasting focus for your eldritch sorcerer spells. Eldritch Sorcerer Tradition \u00b6 Choose an arcane tradition that describes the training you\u2019ve received in manipulating magic. You can choose either Battlemage, Invoker, or Sarishan-Sorcerer Priest, which are detailed at the end of the class. Your choice grants you features when you choose it at 1 st level and again at 6 th , 14 th , and 18 th level. Arcane Flexibility \u00b6 At 2 nd level, you learn how to mold and shape your spells as you cast them. You gain 3 arcane points and gain more arcane points as you reach higher levels in this class, as shown in the Arcane Points column of the Eldritch Sorcerer table. You can never have more arcane points than shown on the table for your level. You regain all spent arcane points when you finish a long rest. on arcane points and how to use them. Metamagic \u00b6 Starting at 3 rd level, you gain the ability to twist your spells to suit your needs. You learn the Metamagic ability subtle spell. Additionally, you gain two Metamagic options From those available to all arcane spellcasters. You gain an additional Metamagic option at 7 th level, another at 10 th level and again at 17 th level. You can only use one Metamagic option on a spell when you cast it, unless otherwise noted. Ability Score Improvement \u00b6 When you reach 4 th level, and again at 8 th , 12 th , 16 th , and 19 th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can\u2019t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. Enhanced Empower \u00b6 Where elder magic is about control and precision, eldritch is about raw power. Starting at 5 th level you gain the ability to rapidly enhance the power of your spell. When you roll damage on a spell, you can spend 1 arcane point to reroll a number of dice up to your Charisma modifier +1 (minimum of one). You must use the new rolls. When you reach 9 th level and use this ability treat all results of 1 as 2s. You can use Enhanced Empowerment even if you have already used a different Metamagic option during the casting of the spell. Arcane Restoration \u00b6 At 20 th level, you regain 4 expended arcane points whenever you finish a short rest. Eldritch Sorcerer Tradition \u00b6 Eldritch sorcerers all draw upon the power of Creation to bring forth their will and turn it into reality, but the skills and specialities that they devote themselves to slowly shapes the nature of their magic. Invoker \u00b6 Invokers focus on the raw power of their spells. They learn how to recycle energy from spells they have already cast and how to make the most of their ability to manipulate the power of the Creation. Repurpose Power \u00b6 Starting at 1 st level, you learn how to cannibalize active spells to empower your spellcasting. As a bonus action, you may end an active 1 st level or greater spell that requires concentration. This grants you a number of temporary arcane points equal to half the level of the spell you ended (minimum 1). These temporary arcane points do not count against the maximum number of arcane points you can possess; any unused arcane points fade at the end of your next turn. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier +1, regaining all expended uses on a long rest. Potent Cantrip \u00b6 At 6 th level, you have learned how to make the most of your cantrips. When you roll damage for a cantrip reroll any of the damage dice that show a 1 or a 2. You must use the new rolls. Potent Casting \u00b6 Starting at 10 th level, you add your Charisma modifier to one damage roll of any spell and cantrip you cast. Endless Font \u00b6 Starting at 14 th level, any time you roll initiative and you have no arcane points, you regain 2 expended arcane points. Eldritch Rending \u00b6 Starting at 18 th level, you can rapidly draw on the arcane power around you, channeling it into a spell with devastating effect. As a bonus action, you can absorb ambient magical energy in order to heighten the power of a spell. You must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a successful save, the next spell you cast before the end of your turn is cast at a spell level equal to it\u2019s minimum level + 4 (maximum 9 th level). You must still expend a spell slot of the spell\u2019s minimum level. If you expend a higher level spell slot, you receive no additional benefits. For example, if you use this feature to cast scorching ray you would cast it as if it were a 6 th level spell (2 nd level minimum +4). You must still expend a 2 nd level spell slot to cast this spell, but you get the benefits of it being cast as if you used a 6 th level spell slot. If you fail the Constitution saving throw, the magical energy you are attempting to channel erupts from you. All creatures, including yourself, in a 10-foot radius around you must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. Affected creatures suffer 5d6 force damage, or half as much on a successful save. Regardless of whether your succeeded or failed on the Constitution saving throw, the area around you is depleted of magical energy when you use Eldritch Rending. For 4 hours, a 50-foot radius zone centered on where you were when you used Eldritch Rending is nearly devoid of the power of Creation. Any creature that targets a creature or object in this zone with a spell has disadvantage on their spell attack roll. Creatures in this zone have advantage on any saving throws against spells. Any creature within this zone that targets a creature or object outside the zone with a spell has disadvantage on their spell attack roll. Any creature affected by a spell cast from within this zone has advantage on any saving throws to resist the spell\u2019s effects, if any. At the end of the turn in which you use this feature, you gain 1 level of exhaustion which may only be removed by resting. You cannot use this feature while you are exhausted. War Mage \u00b6 During its early expansion, the Coryani Empire found that it\u2019s most devastating auxilia were those comprised of War Mages. Exceedingly rare, these men and women were able to tap into the most destructive mystic arts while at the same time close with the enemy and be just as deadly with a gladius. Over time, other militaries saw the wisdom in fielding such highly skilled and versatile soldiers; their only drawback being the difficulty in finding those with the temperament to serve as a War Mage. Military Training \u00b6 As you take levels in the eldritch sorcerer, you continue to train with both arms and armor and your magic. You gain the abilities below at the indicated levels in this class.Physical Training: Starting at 1 st level, your hit point maximum increases by 3. In addition, any time you increase your level in this class, your hit point maximum increases by 1.

Force of Will: Starting at 2 nd level you can add your Charisma modifier to any Constitution saving throw you \u00b6 make to maintain your concentration on a spell which is currently affecting a friendly creature. Never Unarmed: At 3 rd level you learn the spell call to arms *. Battlefield Magic \u00b6 When you cast a spell, you can siphon and reshape some of its arcane power, channeling into your allies. You may choose one of the following Metamagic options, learning an additional option at 4 th level and 6 th level. You can use a Metamagic option you gain from this feature even if you have already used a different Metamagic option during the casting of a spell. \u2022 Enhance Arms Spell: When you cast a spell, you can spend 2 arcane points to temporarily enchant any weapons held by friendly creatures you can see within 20 feet of you. For 1 minute, those weapons are considered magical for the purposes of bypassing immunities and resistances. \u2022 Fortifying Spell: When you cast a spell, you can spend 1 arcane point to grant 5 + your Charisma modifier temporary hit points to a friendly creature you can see within 10 feet. These temporary hit points remain for 1 hour. \u2022 Inspiring Spell: When you cast a spell, you can spend 1 arcane point to grant a friendly creature you can see within 10 feet immunity to fear for 1 minute. Battle Mage \u00b6 Beginning at 6 th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn. Additionally, any time you cast a spell that targets one or more friendly creatures, you can make a melee attack as a bonus action. War Magic \u00b6 Starting at 14 th level, when you use your action to cast a spell, you can make a melee attack as a bonus action. Eldritch Strike \u00b6 Starting at 18 th level, you learn how to make your weapon strikes undercut a creature\u2019s resistance to your spells. When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, that creature does not benefit from its resistances or immunities for the next spell you cast before the end of your next turn.","title":"\u0414\u0440\u0435\u0432\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u043a\u043e\u043b\u0434\u0443\u043d\u044b"},{"location":"homerules/homerules/classes/elder-sorcerer/#elder-sorcerer","text":"Arcane magic taps into the residual energy of Creation to achieve miraculous and often mind-bending effects. This gives these ancient practitioners mastery over such exotic effects as creating an object out of thin air, changing the very essence of one thing to another, or tapping directly into the raw building blocks of reality, such as the Elemental Planes. The Elder Tradition of magic is practiced by the elder races of Arcanis, such as the ssanu, il\u2019Huan, and the elorii. Elder magic tends to be meticulous and precise, befitting races that are so long lived that a decade is a reasonable amount of time to have a discussion. What differentiates elder magic from the eldritch magic practiced by the younger races, such as humans, is the precision in which the raw energy is manifested. Though this assiduous attention to detail makes elder magic potent, it is much slower to cast than its eldritch counterpart. Many wise and intelligent humans have tried to master the Elder Tradition but the rare individual that comes near to succeeding have been driven mad. Many speculate that the human mind lacks certain physiology that the elder races possess and are thus incapable of mastering this tradition. Class Features As an elder sorcerer, you gain the following class features: Race Restrictions Only races the Elder Spellcaster racial feature may take levels in this class.

Spellcasting Ability Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your elder sorcerer spells. Your magic comes from your knowledge and study of the universe. You can use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for an elder sorcerer spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one. Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier Elder Ritual Casting You can cast any elder sorcerer spell you know as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag. When you cast an elder sorcerer spell as a ritual, it takes 15 minutes to cast instead of the normal time, but the spell\u2019s duration is doubled. Spellcasting Focus You can use an arcane focus as a spellcasting focus for your elder sorcerer spells. Arcane Recovery You have learned to regain some of your magical energy through meditative practices and ceremonies. Once per day when you finish a short rest, you can choose expended spell slots to recover. The spell slots can have a combined level that is equal to or less than half your elder sorcerer level (rounded up), and none of the slots can be of 6 th level or higher. For example, if you\u2019re a 4 th level elder sorcerer, you can recover up to two levels worth of spell slots. You can either recover a 2 nd -level spell slot or two 1 st -level spell slots. Elder Sorcerer Tradition When you reach 2 nd level, you choose an arcane tradition, shaping your magical practice. The traditions are detailed at the end of this chapter. Your choice grants you features at 2 nd level and again at 6 th , 10 th , and 14 th level. Arcane Flexibility At 3 rd level, you learn how to mold and shape your spells as you cast them. You gain 2 arcane points and you gain more arcane points as you reach higher levels in this class, as shown in the Arcane Points column of the Elder Sorcerer table. You can never have more arcane points than shown on the table for your level. You regain all spent arcane points when you finish a long rest. See Chapter VI: Magic of Arcanis for more information on arcane points and how to use them. Metamagic Starting at 3 rd level, you gain the ability to twist your spells to suit your needs. You learn the Metamagic option Subtle Spell. You also gain one other Metamagic option of your choice and you gain another one at 7 th level. You can only use one Metamagic option on a spell when you cast it, unless otherwise noted. See Chapter VI: Magic of Arcanis for a complete list of Metamagic options and how to use to use them. Ability Score Improvement When you reach 4 th level, and again at 8 th , 12 th and 16 th and 19 th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can\u2019t increase an ability over 20 by using this feature. Meticulous Spell Shaping Starting at 5 th level, whenever you cast an elder sorcerer spell that forces other creatures to make a saving throw, you can protect some of those creatures from the spell\u2019s full force. To do so, you spend 1 arcane point and choose a number of those creatures up to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1). A chosen creature automatically succeeds on its saving throw against your spell. When you reach 9 th level in this class, chosen creatures have resistance to your spell\u2019s damage. When you reach 13 th level, chosen creatures take no damage from your spell.

Elder Sorcerer Traditions Spellcasters in the Elder Tradition devote entire lifetimes to the perfection of one spell or mastering one school of magic. Such dedication takes time, but for an immortal race time is an endless resource. Arcanist The Arcanist does not seek to master a single aspect of the arcane arts but rather the techniques of casting spells. They seek to master a spell\u2019s placement and refine its use; they seek enlightenment within the pull and push of the forces used to create the effect.

Unlike a normal familiar, when you dismiss your elemental servant, it returns to the Elemental Plane it came from but does not regain any lost hit points or spent hit die until it spends at least 8 hours on its home plane. Your elemental servant will then regain all of its hit points and spent hit dice. If your elemental servant is ever slain, you may not summon a new one until you complete long rest. The elemental servant you then summon is not the same one you had before, it is a new creature. Elemental Companion Your elemental servant gains a variety of benefits.

You can target either your elemental servant or an elemental you have called forth with an elder sorcerer spell and expend one of your spell slots to restore hit points to it. The amount of hit points you restore to the elemental is based on the level of the spell slot you expend. If you expend a 1 st level spell slot you restore 1d8 + your Intelligence modifier. For every slot level above the 1 st that you expend, the healing increases by 1d8. Conjurer\u2019s Grace At 14 th level, you have mastered the art of summoning.

The Mad King of the Crushing Depths (Berokene) The most detailed notes left behind by the dread ssanu sorcerers of the Black Coil dealt with traveling to a watery realm known as the Crushing Deep. This elemental sphere was many times removed from the Mortal Realm that Arcanis resides within, but seemed to be accessible, unlike the Inner Elemental Realms, which were barred to Telas. Anticipating the need to carry over his own breathable atmosphere and some way to fend off the immense pressure promised by the name of the realm, Telas toiled for months before perfecting a new spell he dubbed the cloak of life. He believed that when the spell was cast, it would protect him from whatever inhospitable environment he would find on his travels. Putting faith in his mastery of the arcane arts, Telas cast his newly crafted spell of protection and opened the way to the Realm of the Crushing Deep. Instantly, he was immersed in inky blackness and the vast pressure from the many tons of water above him constricted his chest and made his head pound, despite his precaution. Slowly, the archmage\u2019s eyes adjusted to the dimness and he began to see phosphorescent trails and spots glowing all about him. This faint light revealed that he was in a place consisting almost entirely of ocean water with a few mountain-sized islands floating at different depths. Suddenly, he saw shapes resolve themselves from the gloom. At first, he feared that he had made an error and blundered into a lost ssanu stronghold, for the creatures moving speedily towards him possessed a torso much like his, but with lower extremities that lashed back and forth like a serpent\u2019s tail. Steadying his nerves, knowing full well that any attempt to flee and elude his pursuers was hopeless, Telas readied himself and was relieved to find that though the beings before him had a passing similarity in physiology to the elorii\u2019s ancient serpentine masters, they were of a new and unknown species. After demanding that he identify himself and answer their questions, they were eventually convinced that the archmage was not hostile and, though they politely refused to answer his queries, they escorted him towards the floating landmasses. Upon the largest of these submerged islands Telas found the demesne of the so-called Mad King of the Crushing Deep. Though quite insane by any elorii (or human) standard, the Mad King was also relatively affable and curious about those \u201cwithout\u201d visiting his domain. When first addressed by Telas, the Mad King was amazed at the existence of the elorii. Though he had not heard of an entity named Beroe or any of the other Elemental Lords, he became instantly curious about the Berokene cousins of Telas, the archmage being a Kelekene. After some time, Telas ended his visit with a bargain struck on behalf of Berokene that were versed in elemental sorcery. For a price, (for the Mad King and all his subjects placed great value on fire opals that existed nowhere in that realm, he and his retainers would honor the oaths made with Telas and offer aid and even succor to those who called upon them. You have invoked the Ancient Pact with the Mad King of the Crushing Depths. In return for gifts of fire opals, a rare commodity in the Mad King\u2019s realm, he is willing to send you aid. This connection has additionally channeled and influenced your arcane studies into focusing on your elemental bloodline\u2019s connection to those cold depths. Expanded Sped List The Mad King of the Crushing Depths lets you choose from an expanded list of Spells when you learn an elder warlock spell. The following spells are added to the elder warlock spell list for you.

Boon of the Mad King of the Crushing Depths Starting at 3 rd level, The Mad King of the Crushing Depths has agreed to allow you to summon warriors from his realm. As an action, you may expend an elder warlock spell slot and sacrifice fire opals worth at least 10 gold pieces to summon a Warrior of the Crashing Waves, which appears in an unoccupied space next to you. The Warrior of the Crashing Waves is friendly to you and will disappear when it drops to 0 hit points, after it has served you for one hour, or if you dismiss it as an action. It will also disappear if it is successfully targeted by a casting of dispel magic (or a similar spell or effect) capable of dispelling a spell cast with your elder warlock spell slot. Until the Warrior of the Crashing Waves disappears, you cannot maintain concentration on any spell which conjures or summons a creature or creatures. The Warrior of the Crashing Waves will obey your verbal commands, requiring no action, so long as you share a language with it. If you issue no commands, then the Warrior of the Crashing Waves will attack any creature it sees that is obviously hostile to you. Once you use this feature, you can\u2019t use it again until you complete a long rest. The action used to activate this feature may be interrupted by counterspell as if it were a spell cast with your elder warlock spell slot, in which case the elder warlock spell slot is still expended but the fire opals are not sacrificed, and this feature is not considered to have been used. Starting at 6 th level, you may instead use this feature to summon an Ice Giant Champion of Gayal. If you do so, then the sacrificed fire opals must be worth at least 75 gold pieces. Starting at 14 th level, you may instead use this feature to summon an Aquamancer from the Crushing Deep. If you do so, then the sacrificed fire opals must be worth at least 200 gold pieces.

The Mad King\u2019s Steed Starting at 20 th level, the Mad King has favored you by allowing the summoning of his personal mount, Vardaka, the Megalodon. So long as you are adjacent to a body of water large enough to contain her, as an action you may sacrifice fire opals worth at least 2000 gold pieces to summon Vardaka, who appears in a space of water adjacent to you. Vardaka is friendly to you and your allies, though her frenzy ability may lead to her attacking an ally by mistake. She will disappear when she drops to 0 hit points or after she has served you for 10 minutes for every 2000 gold pieces in value of the sacrificed fire opals. Vardaka is equipped with a strangely modified saddle, and she will allow a single being specified by you to ride her. Vardaka is an intelligent mount and follows the normal mounted combat rules for riding an intelligent creature. She will obey her rider\u2019s commands unless her frenzy ability specifies otherwise. Once you use this feature, you can\u2019t use it again until you complete a long rest. For complete stats on these creatures see Chapter V: Bestiary. Tsunami - the Mad King\u2019s Reluctant Final Boon This final boon of the Mad King is only asked of him by those as insane as the Mad King himself or those in the direst of predicaments. This ritual must be The Tiar of the Realm of the Swift Zephyrs (Osalikene) After his remarkable journey to the Realm of the Crushing Deep, Telas was emboldened to continue traveling to different realms in the hopes of finding some trace of the lost Eloran deities. Reviewing even more ancient ssanu documents left behind by their former scaled masters, he found mention of a place known as the Realm of the Swift Zephyrs. The term \u2018zephyrs\u2019 was one used by Lord Osalian when describing some of the denizens that existed in His domain and this spurred hope that he could find some trace of the elorii gods. Having already learned how to peel back the barriers that separate the Mortal Realm from others, Telas was soon transported to the Realm of the Swift Zephyrs and immediately found himself falling as if from a tremendous height. Struggling to tap down his rising panic, he quickly surveyed the area about him, and but for the deep lavender sky and quickly moving clouds, he saw nothing else. No land or ocean were within view and whatever he was falling towards must be so far below as to be invisible to his eye. Whether it was his presence or the strangled screams that escaped his lips, regardless of the efforts made to maintain control of his fears, large patches of pastel hued \u201cclouds\u201d seemed to form about him and slowed his descent. Within seconds, the archmage found himself upon a miraculously semi-solid cloudbank that stretched in all directions for what seemed to be leagues. At first Telas believed himself alone, but he soon noticed a portion of the air before him zipping and whizzing about him and a low buzzing nagged at his ears. Slowly, a form began to coalesce, though it still refused to remain in one place. \u201dCanyouunderstandusmw,creature?\u201d a voice asked from in front, to the side and then above him. Beginning to understand what was happening, Telas spoke as quickly as his mouth could form the words and still be intelligible. \u201cYes, though the people of my Realm do not move or speak as quickly as you do. Please slow down so that we may communicate. \u201d With great effort the multi- formed image merged into one, revealing a tall and slender entity of breathtaking beauty. Telas thought of the being as a \u201cher\u201d, though in fact the Zephyrs do not possess a gender. With great effort, his rescuer explained, in what must have been a glacially slow manner for her, that he was indeed in the Realm of the Swift Zephyrs and that he was at the outskirts of the domain of Tiar Sur\u2019hy of the Zephyrs; Tiar being some sort of honorific similar to a Lord or iMNg. Traveling on a mixture of solidified air and clouds, Telas eventually met with Tiar Sur\u2019hy who expressed astonishment at\u2003 discovering the elorii. Like the Mad King of the Crushing Deep, Sur\u2019hy possessed no knowledge of Holy Osalian. The Tiar explained that travel between the Realms was rare but not unheard of as they had had periodic contact with Lord Gorum and assisted him during the War. When Telas asked about the War, the Tiar became suspicious and the archmagi thought it best to change the subject. After negotiating a similar bargain for the Osalikene as he did for the Berokene, Telas resolved to gain an audience with Lord Gorum and his Realm of the Solid Sky. You have invoked the Ancient Pact with the Tiar of the Realm of the Swift Zephyrs. In return for gifts of diamonds, a rare commodity in the Tiar\u2019s realm, she is willing to send you aid. This connection has additionally channeled and influenced your arcane studies into focusing on your elemental bloodline\u2019s connection to the air. Expanded Sped List The Tiar of the Realm of the Swift Zephyrs lets you choose from an expanded list of spells when you learn an elder warlock spell. The following spells are added to the elder warlock spell list for you.

Elemental blast Starting at 1 st level, you learn the elemental blast cantrip, which does not count against your total elder warlock cantrips known. It deals your choice of thunder or lightning damage, chosen at the time of casting. Boon of the Tiar of the Realm of the Swift Zephyrs Starting at 3 rd level, The Tiar of the Realm of the Swift Zephyrs has agreed to allow you to summon warriors from her realm. As an action, you may expend an elder warlock spell slot and sacrifice diamonds worth at least 10 gold pieces to summon a Zephyr Warrior, which appears in an unoccupied space next to you. The Zephyr Warrior is friendly to you and will disappear when it drops to 0 hit points, after it has served you for one hour, or if you dismiss it as an action. It will also disappear if it is successfully targeted by a casting of dispel magic (or a similar spell or effect) capable of dispelling a spell cast with your elder warlock spell slot. Until the Zephyr Warrior disappears, you cannot maintain concentration on any spell which conjures or summons a creature or creatures. The Zephyr Warrior will obey your verbal commands, requiring no action, so long as you share a language with it. If you issue no commands, then the Zephyr Warrior will attack any creature it sees which is obviously hostile to you. Once you use this feature, you can\u2019t use it again until you complete a long rest. The action used to activate this feature may be interrupted by counterspell as if it were a spell cast with your elder warlock spell slot, in which case the elder warlock spell slot is still expended but the diamonds are not sacrificed, and this feature is not considered to have been used. Starting at 6 th level, you may instead use this feature to summon a Slayer of the Steel Wind. If you do so, then the sacrificed diamonds must be worth at least 75 gold pieces. Starting at 14 th level, you may instead use this feature to summon an Aeromancer from the Realm of the Swift Zephyrs. If you do so, then the sacrificed diamonds must be worth at least 200 gold pieces.

You gain resistance to thunder damage. Blessing of the Zephyr Starting at 10 th level, your connection to the Realm of the Swift Zephyrs has further enhanced your resistances against the nature of air. You gain immunity to thunder damage and resistance to lightning damage. If you were already resistant to lightning damage, then you instead gain immunity. Improved Pact Ritual Starting at 14 th level, you may expend an elder warlock spell slot to use the Boon of the Tiar of the Realm of the Swift Zephyrs feature a second time before completing a long iesi. The Tiar\u2019s Favored Pet Starting at 20 th level, the Tiar has favored you by allowing the summoning of her favorite pet, Granbeier the Bearded Vulture. So long as you are adjacent to a space large enough to contain it, as an action you may sacrifice diamonds worth at least 2000 gold pieces to summon Granbeier, who appears in a space adjacent to you. Granbeier is friendly to you and your allies and obeys your commands as if you were the Tiar herself. It will disappear when it drops to 0 hit points or after it has served you for 10 minutes for every 2000 gold pieces in value of the sacrificed diamonds. So long as it was not dropped to 0 hit points, it will demand its own payment for its services ten minutes before it vanishes. It asks you to provide it with carrion flesh equivalent to four medium creatures or one large creature. If you do not do so, then you must succeed on a DC 30 Charisma (Persuasion) check to convince Granbeier to leave without its reward. If you fail this roll and cannot provide the carrion it has demanded, then Granbeier will attack you and attempt to claim you for its meal before it vanishes. Once you use this feature, you can\u2019t use it again until you complete a long rest. For complete stats on these creatures see Chapter V: Bestiary. Hurricane - the Tiar\u2019s Reluctant Final Boon The Tiar will only grant this boon if she is convinced that the need is dire. Once granted, she sends a score of the most powerful and vicious air elementals, known as the Storm Furies, to the area directed by the summoner and allows them to unleash their might. Use of this rite should be given the utmost consideration as the vast storm summoned will not discriminate between friend and foe. Approximately fifty years ago, during the latter part of the Coryani Civil War, a deadly and destructive hurricane crashed upon the shores of Cafela and the city of Sweet Savona. The city was engaged in repelling invading forces when it was devastated by the storm as well. Between the casualties inflicted by the hurricane and the warring factions, Sweet Savona suffered the greatest loss of life of any battle of the Civil War. Some learned magi believe that the storm was a manifestation of this\u2003 rite, so quickly did it materialize, but evidence to substantiate these claims was never discovered. You may enact this terrible ritual within 5 miles of your target by spending 15 minutes in uninterrupted incantation and sacrificing your life and your soul. Once payment is made and the final words of intonation are uttered, a gentle breeze begins to blow in from the horizon. Within minutes, the wind grows to a deafening howl, and it continues to grow into a hurricane that covers 20 square miles. Although most effective if used on a coastal region, the rite can create a devastating storm in any locale or time of year. For example, if used in a mountainous region during the winter, the storm will manifest as a brutal blizzard. The conjured storm covers a large area, easily big enough to envelop a large city and its environs. The targeted area is wracked by hurricane force winds (sustained winds or gusts in excess of 118 km/h, 74 mph), lightning strikes, and torrential rains. If the targeted area is a coastal one, then ocean surges in the range of ten to twenty feet can flood the area as well. Most wooden structures will be utterly destroyed, and unsheltered people and animals will be swept away; their shattered bodies found many miles away, if ever found at all. Buildings and other structures made of solid stone should survive the storm intact, but widespread damage and loss of life is likely even so. Anything and anyone in the area of the storm will be crushed by flying debris and their remains carried off as a massive gale purges almost everything from the land. The gamemaster should estimate that the effects of the storm will destroy anything not made from stone and will kill anyone not sheltered in such a structure in a ten square mile area. You may only use this feature if you have learned in\u00acplay the secret of speaking the Kurenthe curse. The use of this feature kills you and destroys your essence to fuel its power, and your death in this manner may not be mitigated or undone by anything short of direct, divine intervention. At the gamemaster\u2019s discretion, the Tiar of the Realm of the Zephyrs may refuse to grant this boon or may ask an additional sacrifice or service before granting it. Lord Gorum of the Realm of the Solid Sky (Marokene) The transition from the Realm of the Swift Zephyrs to the Realm of the Solid Sky was a relatively easy one given that Tiar Sur\u2019hy and Lord Gorum appear to maintain cordial, if infrequent diplomatic relations monolithic giant tried to keep up with his answers. \u201cWe walk upon the Path of the Ten Thousand, Thousand Steps, which connects the entrance to Lord Gorum\u2019s Realm with the ramparts. These crumbling walls and Lord Gorum\u2019s Sentinels all are that stand between the structured order of the universe, as set by the Creator, and pure Chaos, which seeks to undo His great works. \u201d The inquisitive elorii\u2019s questions appeared to tax the monolith\u2019s patience for it fell silent, as its massive stride chewed the distance to the entry to the Realm of the Solid Sky. Its final words were, \u201cLord Gorum will answer all of your questions, incessant one. \u201d The distance that they walked did not seem to bring them any closer to their destination, and after a time, Falladrin consented to carry the fragile mage along the way. Exhausted, the archmage fell in a deep meditative trace sometime during their passage for when he awoke, he lay on a cobblestone floor. Cursing himself for his frailty, Telas quickly jumped to his feet. It was then that he noticed the gargantuan foot that was before him. He turned his gaze upward but was only able to see up to the being\u2019s knees before the rest was lost in the darkness. Suddenly, the portion of the floor upon which he stood shot upward, forcing him again to his knees. Within moments, he was before a face the size of the largest towers that once adorned Bright Belestor. \u201cI have adjusted the pressure of my Realm so as not to cause you discomfort, elorii. Have I misjudged your physical needs?\u201d Rising to his feet, Telas bowed deeply. \u201cNot at all, Lord Gorum. L merely fell to my knees to better show my deference to your majesty. \u201d What at first Telas thought was a being seated upon a stone throne, was instead one entire creature; in fact, Telas began to wonder if the entire realm was but one complete sentient entity. As he observed, there seemed not to be a place where Lord Gorum ended and the throne began. He further noticed that the \u201cthrone\u201d flowed directly from the floor and wall as if the \u201cLord Gorum\u201d he saw was only a manifestation for his benefit. Telas began to form the theory that Lord Gorum and the Realm of the Solid Sky were one. Feeling that airing his hypothesis might be rude and detrimental to his health, Telas instead asked about the chaos that Falladrin mentioned. \u201cKnow you so little of the Creation, little elorii?\u201d Asked Gorum. \u201cWhen the Creator brought light to the darkness, He first\u2003 needed to bring into existence the essence of Chaos, the building blocks of Order. From this vast store of potential, the Creator crafted everything we see, hear, andfeel. He molded Order from Chaos, but some of this ever-changing mass was left over \u2014 unused. \u201cAnd now this remnant seeks to break down all that was created and begin anew, in a never-ending cycle of conception and destruction until perfection is achieved. Or so the creatures of chaos we have been able to capture tells us. Somehow, within the maelstrom sea of pandemonium, intelligence has emerged, slaves to the concept that what the Creator has made is imperfect and impure, requiring it to break us down to our constituent bits. The creatures of Chaos believe we embody stagnation and that we stand in the way of perfection. With creatures that are beholden to such a philosophy there can be no negotiation\u2026 no compromise. \u201cAnd so, like all the other Lord Gorum before me, Ifollow the instructions of the Creator and hold this bulwark against the sea of Chaos that assaults us. Now andforever more, we are the Guardians of Order, the Protectors of Life, and should we fail, all will be consumed. \u201d Time passed with Telas asking much about this War with Chaos and the form that their agents take. He came to know much of them and additionally learned of another, even greater threat known as Oblivion, but of that Lord Gorum knew but whispers. Yet as knowledgeable as the monolithic monarch of this realm seemed to be, he knew nothing of mighty Marok or any of the other gods, though he did point the archmage to the Realm of the Burnished Flame, a place where entities similar to Lord Keleos dwelled. Again, Telas negotiated a similar pact between Lord Gorum and his people and any Marokene elorii that were versed in elemental sorcery. At first Lord Gorum\u2019s request for the nuts and seedlings of trees such as the oak and redwoods puzzled the archmage, until he remembered those thick ropelike roots that wove in and out of the ramparts he first saw. These seedlings were planted deep within the barrier and reinforced it just like the roots of trees keep the earth from washing away. Bidding his host farewell, Telos traveled to the realm that held the greatest promise of finding a sign of the lost deities. You have invoked the Ancient Pact with Lord Gorum of the Realm of the Solid Sky. In return for gifts of nuts and seedlings from monumental trees, a rare commodity Lord Gorum requires for the defense of his realm, he is willing to send you aid. This connection has additionally channeled and influenced your arcane studies into focusing on your elemental bloodline\u2019s connection to the stone. Expanded Spell List Lord Gorum lets you choose from an expanded list of spells when you learn an elder warlock spell. The following spells are added to the elder warlock spell list for you. Spells marked with f are found in the Arcanis 5e Campaign Setting and spells marked with a * are new spells found later in the Chapter IV: Elder Magic of Arcanis. LORD GORUM OF THE REALM OF THE SOLID SKY EXPANDED SPELL LIST 1 st Earth spikes*, longstrider 2 nd Earth shieldf, spike growth 3 rd Meld into stone, slow 4 th Stone shape, wrath of stone\u2019 5 th Creation, wall of stone 6 th Flesh to stone, move earth 8 th Earthquake Elemental Familiar Starting at 1 st level, your bond with Lord Gorum allows you to summon creatures from his realm. You learn find familiar as an additional elder warlock spell known, which does not count against your total elder warlock spells known. Any time you summon a familiar, its type changes to elemental regardless of its form. Your familiar gains the following traits: \u2022 Regardless of the form it takes, your familiar seems to be made of dust and stone. \u2022 It gains a burrow speed equal to the highest speed listed on its stat-block, or it may add +10 feet to an existing burrow-speed. \u2022 It loses any fly Speed it may have had. \u2022 It can burrow through non-magical, unworked earth and stone. While doing so, it doesn\u2019t disturb the material it moves through. It is resistant to acid damage. It is vulnerable to lightning damage and thunder damage. Elemental blast Starting at 1 st level, you learn the elemental blast cantrip, which does not count against your total elder warlock cantrips known. It deals your choice of acid or bludgeoning damage chosen at the time of casting. The beams of energy are made of stone and quicksilver. Boon of the Lord of the Realm of the Solid Sky Starting at 3 rd level, Lord Gorum has agreed to allow you to summon warriors from his realm. As an action, you may expend an elder warlock spell slot and sacrifice rare seedlings worth at least 10 gold pieces to summon a Warrior of Jehelka, which appears in an unoccupied space next to you. The Warrior of Jehelka is friendly to you and will disappear when it drops to 0 hit points, after it has served you for one hour, or if you dismiss it as an action. It will also disappear if it is successfully targeted by a casting of dispel magic (or a similar spell or effect) capable of dispelling a spell cast with your elder warlock spell slot. Until the Warrior of Jehelka disappears, you cannot maintain concentration on any spell which conjures or summons a creature or creatures. The Warrior of Jehelka will obey your verbal, requiring no action, so long as you share a language with it. If you issue no commands, then the Warrior of Jehelka will attack any creature it sees which is obviously hostile to you. Once you use this feature, you can\u2019t use it again until you complete long rest. The action used to activate this feature may be interrupted by counterspell as if it were a spell cast with your elder warlock spell slot, in which case the elder warlock spell slot is still expended but the rare seedlings are not sacrificed, and this feature is not considered to have been used. Starting at 6 th level, you may instead use this feature to summon a Monolithic Juggernaut. If you do so, then the sacrificed rare seedlings must be worth at least 75 gold pieces. Starting at 14 th level, you may instead use this feature to summon a Terramancer from the Realm of the Solid Sky. If you do so, then the sacrificed rare seedlings must be worth at least 200 gold pieces. Grounding of the Solid Sky Starting at 6 th level, your connection to the Realm of the Solid Sky has fortified you against that which is anathema to your elemental nature and the nature of Lord Gorum\u2019s realm. You gain resistance to lightning damage. Blessing of the Solid Sky Starting at 10 th level, your connection to the Realm of the Solid Sky has enhanced your natural resistance to acid to fortify you against the nature of Lord Gorum\u2019s realm. You gain immunity to acid damage. Improved Pact Ritual Starting at 14 th level, you may expend an elder warlock spell slot to use the Boon of the Lord of the Realm of the Solid Sky feature a second time before completing a long rest. Lord Gorum\u2019s Fierce Ally Starting at 20 th level, Lord Gorum has favored you by allowing the summoning of his fierce ally, the Colossus of Jehelka, a being so powerful that on its world it is worshipped as a god. So long as you are adjacent to a space large enough to contain it, as an action you may sacrifice rare seedlings worth at least 2000 gold pieces to summon the Colossus, who appears in a space adjacent to you. Care must be taken when calling upon the Colossus as it is a relentless force upon the battlefield. As part of the action used to summon the Colossus, you must identify the foes you would like destroyed. The Colossus will go on a rampage and not stop until it has completed the task required of it; it will not care what collateral damage it causes along the way or if non-combatants or allies are inadvertently wounded in its attacks. Once given a directive, the Colossus cannot be dismissed, recalled, or ordered to cease its attacks. It will return to its native realm once it has been reduced to 0 hit points, all the identified enemies have been vanquished, or an amount of time has passed equal to 10 minutes per 2000 gold pieces worth of rare seedlings sacrificed, whichever comes first. Once you use this feature, you can\u2019t use it again until you complete a long rest. For complete stats on these creatures see Chapter V: Bestiary. Earthquake - Lord Gorum\u2019s Reluctant Final Boon Lord Gorum is loath to grant this ritual as its effect is more akin to the devastation wrought by the forces of Chaos that he battles, than the stability and order, which he extols. Nevertheless, if the need is great and the cause just in his eyes, the Lord of the Realm of the Solid Sky will allow the invoker to wield its power. This rite, like the equivalent spells from the other realms, should be used with great care and judiciously as it is capable of causing great loss of life and destruction of property. One need only look to Fallen Illian, the first city built by the humans after their conquest of blessed Belestor, to see the spell\u2019s capacity to inflict utter ruin upon those within its affected area, for that ill-fated city was swallowed whole by the very earth. The elder sorcerer responsible for the attack was a member of those who would one day call themselves Malfelan, who felt that a natural catastrophe of such a great magnitude would allow his fellow elorii to move unmolested out of the Vastwood. Unfortunately, the human sorcerers had mastered their crude manipulation of the arcane energies and discovered who and what had caused the earthquake. They fell upon those elorii traveling south with a great vengeance and slaughtered thousands of them. The surviving elorii who made it to the shelter of the southern forest called it a victory, for they had slain over fifty thousand humans, but none have ever called upon Lord Gorum\u2019s boon ever since. You may enact this terrible ritual within 5 miles of your target by spending 15 minutes in uninterrupted incantation and sacrificing your life and your soul. Once payment is made and the final words of intonation are uttered, a massive rumbling can be felt roiling through the earth. The rite may be cast in any geographic location, though side effects such as tidal waves may occur if cast near a coastal region or at sea, while torrents of magma may erupt upward if in a volcanic region. At first a small rumbling may be felt, followed swiftly by a tremor, which can cause anything not heavy enough or tied down to topple. To those knowledgeable in earth magic, the tremor may give them enough warning to flee the affected area if they are quick enough. Within a few minutes after the tremor, the ground will begin to shake violently, the solid ground appearing to be transformed into an undulating sea. These shockwaves will destroy all but the strongest of constructions, which will suffer some sort of structural damage unless magically protected. The ground will then begin to crack and shatter, possibly swallowing large swaths of land and entombing them underground. Anything touching the ground within 10 miles of the earthquake\u2019s epicenter is destroyed as buildings collapse, fissures open, and the very ground liquefies beneath the feet of the hapless beings unlucky enough to be within range of the dev .IM a ion. You may only use this feature if you have learned in\u00acplay the secret of speaking the Kurenthe curse. The use of this feature kills you and destroys your essence to fuel its power, and your death in this manner may not be mitigated or undone by anything short of direct, divine intervention. At the gamemaster\u2019s discretion, Lord Gorum may refuse to grant this boon or may ask an additional sacrifice or service before granting it. The Sheykh of the Realm of the Burnished Flame (Kelekene) By Lord Gorum\u2019s leave, his Prime Counsel opened a small breach within their nigh-impenetrable defenses to the Realm of the Burnished Flame. Transitioning through the rift in space, Telos soon found himself in a world that appeared to be in its death throes; huge eruptions of molten rock leapt hundreds of feet into the air and the sky itself was thick with banks of sulfur and soot. Strangely, the elorii archmage felt invigorated and quite at home in the churning inferno. Looking about, Telos found that he stood on a rocky shore and what appeared to be a paved road was but a few feet from his position. The ambient heat, which strangely felt soothing upon his flesh, made objects in\u2003 the distance waver as if a mirage, but he could make out an immense metropolis rising majestically on the horizon. As he made his way to the city, he noted strange balls of flame rolling past, whizzing this way and that. After observing them for a while, Telos realized that the fire balls were creatures made of living flame and their strange movements was because of the small, almost invisible metallic insects which they hunted and consumed. His journey took the elorii past fields littered with shards of sharp obsidian and thick layers of ash from that rose from what appeared to be petrified trees of enormous proportions. As he traveled closer, the city took on a sharper image: a huge wall surrounded buildings that were a mix of neck-bending towers, blocky structures that just peeked over the wall, and other buildings topped by minarets. He later came to understand that the inhabitants of the city, whose name was Milshara, the Burnished City of Brass, were a varied lot. Some had a stony appearance with bright tongues of flame licking out of the various joints, while others were of a more metallic hue, with the same tell-tale licks of flame. After a short amount of time within their midst, Telos came to understand that the indigenous inhabitants of this realm were beings of living flame. The appearances that they affected were to them what clothing was to the beings living upon Arcanis. Unlike clothing, however, the lords of this place dictated what form one could assume, which was predicated upon one\u2019s duties and social standing. It was not long before the elorii\u2019s presence was brought to the attention of the ruling caste. Living flames encased in elaborate and highly stylized armor accosted him and brought him forth to the Palace of Incandescence, forcing him to kneel before a large throne made of gleaming brass or bronze. Shortly thereafter, a regal being of smoldering, red flesh appeared and sat on the throne, instantly followed by others of his kind. Telos was informed that he was in the presence of the immortal Sheykh Andalsanna of the Shaitan Empire and was ordered to explain what he was and why he had trespassed upon his city uninvited. What followed were the most harrowing and enlightening hours of conversation that the archmage had ever experienced. He discovered that these Shaitan lorded over an immense empire that spanned many conquered realms, including the one which he now stood upon. The home realm of the empire was core ward and was a place that hovered near the pure realm where only heat and fire existed. When asked if the Sheykh had heard of his God, Keleos, Telos was told such a devastating and terrible story that the archmage was shocked mute for several minutes. What Telos was told that day, he never related to anyone during his short return to\u2003 Arcanis. Those who saw him said that he looked an empty shell of man, with haunted eyes and a face that looked as if it were incapable of ever smiling again. What the archmage did say was that he had bargained with the Sheykh and he would serve him for one- thousand and one years, as they recorded time in exchange of ensuring that no other elorii would ever be taught the way to travel to the other realms. However, the archmage did not want his own people to be denied the same access to powers that he had acquired for the other elorii and so a final sorcerous pact was made between the Kelekene who had mastered elemental sorcery and the Shaitan of the Realm of the Burnished Flame. Bidding his people a final farewell, the archmage Telos disappeared one last time and though many have awaited his return, he has never been seen again. You have invoked the Ancient Pact with the Sheykh of the Realm of the Burnished Flame. In return for gifts of black pearls, a rare commodity in his realm, he is willing to send you aid. This connection has additionally channeled and influenced your arcane studies into focusing on your elemental bloodline\u2019s connection to fire. Expanded Sped List The Sheykh lets you choose from an expanded list of spells when you learn an elder warlock spell. The following spells are added to the elder warlock spell list for you. Spells marked with f are found in the Arcanis 5e Campaign Setting and spells marked with a * are new spells found later in the Chapter IV: Elder Magic of Arcanis. THE SHEYKH OF THE REALM OF THE BURNISHED FLAME EXPANDED SPELL LIST 1 st Burning hands, shield 2 nd Flaming sphere, scorching ray 3 rd Fireball, haste 4 th Fire shield, wall of fire 5 th Flame strike, mirage* 7 th Delayed blast fireball 8 th Incendiary cloud 9 th Meteor swarm Elemental Familiar Starting at 1 st level, your bond with the Sheykh of the Realm of the Burnished Flame allows you to summon creatures from his realm. You learn find familiar as an additional elder warlock spell known, which does not count against your total elder warlock spells known. Any time you summon a familiar, its type changes to elemental regardless of its form. Your familiar gains the following traits: \u2022 Regardless of the form it takes, your familiar seems to be made of living flame. \u2022 It can move through a space as narrow as 1 inch wide without squeezing. \u2022 It can choose to shed bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. \u2022 It is resistant to fire damage and vulnerable to cold damage. Elemental blast Starting at 1 st level, you learn the elemental blast cantrip, which does not count against your total elder warlock cantrips known. It deals fire damage. Boon of the Sheykh of the Realm of the Burnished Flame Starting at 3 rd level, the Sheykh of the Realm of the Burnished Flame has agreed to allow you to summon warriors from his realm. As an action, you may expend an elder warlock spell slot and sacrifice black pearls worth at least 10 gold pieces to summon a Blazing Archer of Milshara, which appears in an unoccupied space next to you. The Blazing Archer of Milshara is friendly to you and will disappear when it drops to 0 hit points, after it has served you for one hour, or if you dismiss it as an action. It will also disappear if it is successfully targeted by a casting of dispel magic (or a similar spell or effect) capable of dispelling a spell cast with your elder warlock spell slot. Until the Blazing Archer of Milshara disappears, you cannot maintain concentration on any spell that conjures or summons a creature or creatures. The Blazing Archer of Milshara will obey your verbal commands, requiring no action, so long as you share a language with it. If you issue no commands, then the Blazing Archer of Milshara will attack any creature it sees, which is obviously hostile to you. Once you use this feature, you can\u2019t use it again until you complete long rest. The action used to activate this feature may be interrupted by counterspell as if it were a spell cast with your elder warlock spell slot, in which case the elder warlock spell slot is still expended but the black pearls are not sacrificed, and this feature is not considered to have been used. Starting at 6 th level, you may instead use this feature to summon a Molten Tiger. If you do so, then the sacrificed black pearls must be worth at least 75 gold pieces. Starting at 14 th level, you may instead use this feature to summon a Pyromancer from the Realm of the Burnished Flame. If you do so, then the sacrificed black pearls must be worth at least 200 gold pieces. Fortitude of the Burnished Flame Starting at 6 th level, your connection to the realm of the Burnished Flame has fortified you against that which is anathema to your elemental nature and the nature of the Sheykh\u2019s realm. You gain resistance to cold damage. Blessing of the Burnished Flame Starting at 10 th level, your connection to the realm of the Burnished Flame has enhanced your natural resistance to acid to fortify you against the nature of the Sheykh\u2019s realm. You gain immunity to fire damage. Improved Pact Ritual Starting at 14 th level, you may expend an elder warlock spell slot to use the Boon of the Sheykh of the Realm of the Burnished Flame feature a second time before completing a long rest. The Sheykh\u2019s Ancient Friend Starting at 20 th level, the Sheykh has favored you by allowing the summoning of his friend, Exurapas the Flaming Phoenix, believed by many denizens of the fire aligned Inner Realms to be the creator of all. So long as you are adjacent to a space large enough to contain it, as an action you may sacrifice black pearls worth at least 2000 gold pieces to summon Exurapas, who appears in a space adjacent to you. Care must be taken when calling upon Exurapas as it is a nigh-uncontrollable force of destruction. Once it appears, Exurapas will attack all living things in the immediate area, excluding only you. As an action, you may attempt a DC 25 Charisma (Persuasion) check to convince Exurapas to spare your allies. It will return to its native realm once it is reduced to 0 hit points, an amount of time has passed equal to 10 minutes per 2000 gold pieces worth of black pearls sacrificed, it has extinguished the lives of all detectable living creatures aside from those it has been convinced to spare, or you use an action to send it home. Once you use this feature, you can\u2019t use it again until you complete a long rest. For complete stats on these creatures see Chapter V: Bestiary. Storm of Fire - the Sheykh\u2019s Final Boon Of all the Lords of the Inner Realms encountered by Telos, only the Sheykh is happy to grant a final boon such as this. The reason is that while the boon granted is a devastating rain of fire, it is accomplished by sending thousands of lesser elementals to the elder warlock\u2019s realm and allowing them free reign in spreading destruction throughout that land. In essence, each time the Storm of Fire ritual is enacted, it acts as a small invasion by the Realm of the Burnished Sky, to what end, only the Sheykh knows. It is said that fire is a living thing, running rampant, consuming all that is in its path, breathing and growing until finally dying out. It is for this reason that pyromancers, more than any other elemental sorcerers, must take utmost care and exert unrivaled control over their flames, for once the fire has been summoned, unlike earth, air, or water, it will strain to be free, struggling to consume and grow without restraint. To date, there has never been a need so great that a Kelekene has seen the need to call down this torrent of flame. Even the Malfelan, long known to take extreme\u2003 action against their foes, have not resorted to this measure. You may enact this terrible ritual within five miles of your target by spending 15 minutes in uninterrupted incantation and sacrificing your life and your soul. Once payment is made and the final words of intonation are uttered, your sacrifice causes an unnatural storm to begin to form above a targeted region covering 10 square miles. Shattering thunder and weirdly greenish bolts of lightning presage the coming of the storm, but unlike those that Lord Hurrian commands, this storm unleashes sheets of fire. The flames ignite any flammable material in the initial area, incinerating wooden structures in minutes. The air grows so hot that it causes any mortal breathing it to literally burn from the inside out. Anyone in the immediate area caught outside of shelter will be incinerated. Stone buildings will afford some small measure of protection, but eventually the heat will increase to the point that the very walls will glow and anyone trapped inside will be cooked alive as if they were within an oven. The storm of fire will initially destroy everything in a ten-mile radius. The fire ignited by the ritual will continue to burn wildly for so long as there is fuel for it to consume. The one thing in the defenders\u2019 favor is that the flames summoned by the spell are ultimately of a mundane nature and can be extinguished by normal means: water, fire lines, lack of oxygen, etc. This may be a small consolation as the raging inferno covers such a large area that those seeking to put it out may have no recourse but to let the fires burn themselves out. You may only use this feature if you have learned in\u00acplay the secret of speaking the Kurenthe curse. The use of this feature kills you and destroys your essence to fuel its power, and your death in this manner may not be mitigated or undone by anything short of direct, divine intervention. At the gamemaster\u2019s discretion, the Sheykh may refuse to grant this boon or may ask an additional sacrifice or service before granting it. The Plant Lords (Ardakene) Hearing of the woeful tale of the archmage Telos, Mendros, a Life Warden of great power and knowledge, saw the benefit of forging such sorcerous pacts with other great powers, but also saw the folly of trucking with beings not of this world. Though forbidden by his elders, the young Life Warden decided that the benefits to his people far outweighed the dangers he would face or the censure that might be voices rung out, \u201cWe have decided that you speak from the heart and true. Regrettably, we cannot help you as we do not know where the Mother hides herself though we know that she still lives and is within our realm. \u201d \u201cWho are you that you would know this?\u201d Mendros asked. A rumbling ensued that the Life Warden was startled to realize was their form of laughter. \u201cWe are Her first. This sacred place was where the Mother, Belisarda, awakened. So full of joy, She shared the gift of sentience with those about Her and so awakened us and gave us the ability to realize that we \u2018were\u2019. Over time, our roots have grown strong and connected with others of our kind that have not awakened, but nonetheless are aware of what is about them. From that web of life, we know that She still lives somewhere among us, but hides Herself As great and vast as our power is, Hers is greater. We cannot find Her. \u201d Mendros stayed among these Plant Lords, as he came to call them, for they had no need of names amongst themselves, and lived for a long while upon this island continent that had birthed the Life Mother. While beautiful with all sorts of plants and flowers that were unknown or extinct elsewhere upon Arcanis, this land was also fraught with danger as nature had run amok here, creating some of the most exotic and dangerous creatures he had ever encountered. After a lifetime of learning and communing with these primordial beings, Mendros decided to take his leave and return to Elonbe. Before he left, he made arrangements whereby other Ardakene may call upon them. Pacts were made and sworn on that day. As part of the agreement, Mendros was tasked with taking small saplings, progeny of the Plant Lords, and planting them on the soil of the different continents. The last two he planted within the sacred grove in Elonbe. You have invoked the Ancient Pact with the Plant Lords. In return for gifts of fervidite, a rare commodity, the Plant Lords require for unknown reasons, they are willing to send you aid. This connection has additionally channeled and influenced your arcane studies into focusing on your elemental bloodline\u2019s connection to life and nature. Expanded Spell List The Plant Lords let you choose from an expanded list of spells when you learn an elder warlock spell. The following spells are added to the elder warlock spell list for you. Spells marked with f are found in the Arcanis 5e Campaign Setting and spells marked with a * are new spells found later in the Chapter IV: Elder Magic of Arcanis. Calling Upon the Green Starting at 1 st level, your bond to the Plant Lords allows you to summon creatures made from the essence of life and nature. Any time you cast a spell or use an ability that allows you to conjure or summon a creature of the elemental type, you may instead conjure or summon a creature of the Plant type with a challenge rating equal to or lower than the challenge rating of the elemental normally conjured or summoned by the spell or ability. For example, you may conjure a shambling mound by casting conjure elemental. Additionally, starting at 1 st level, you learn find familiar as an additional elder warlock spell known, which does not count against your total elder warlock spells known. Any time you summon a familiar, its type changes to Plant regardless of its form. Your familiar gains the following traits: \u2022 Regardless of the form taken its coloration is always deep green with emerald green eyes. \u2022 Its coloration grants it advantage on all Dexterity (Stealth) checks when within natural foliage of the same color. Elemental blast Starting at 1 st level, you learn the elemental blast cantrip, which does not count against your total elder warlock cantrips known. It deals your choice of slashing or radiant damage, chosen at the time of casting. The beams of energy are made of a\u2003 combination of spectral vines and pure life energy. Additionally, anytime you would drop a creature\u2019s hit point total to 0 with elemental blast, you may choose to have them automatically succeed at their death saving throw, stabilizing at 0 hit points, even if the damage done would normally kill them. Boon of the Plant Lords Starting at 3 rd level, the Plant Lords have agreed to send protectors to watch over you when needed. As an action, you may expend an elder warlock spell slot and sacrifice fervidite worth at least 10 gold pieces to summon a Protector of the Green, which appears in an unoccupied space next to you. The Protector of the Green is friendly to you and will disappear when it drops to 0 hit points, after it has served you for one hour, or if you dismiss it as an action. It will also disappear if it is successfully targeted by a casting of dispel magic (or a similar spell or effect) capable of dispelling a spell cast with your elder warlock spell slot. Until the Protector of the Green disappears, you cannot maintain concentration on any spell that conjures or summons a creature or creatures. The Protector of the Green will obey your verbal commands, requiring no action, so long as you share a language with it. If you issue no commands, then the Protector of the Green will attack any creature it sees that is obviously hostile to you. The action used to activate this feature may be interrupted by counterspell as if it were a spell cast with your elder warlock spell slot, in which case the elder warlock spell slot is still expended but the fervidite is not sacrificed and this feature is not considered to have been used. Once you use this feature, you can\u2019t use it again until you complete long rest. Starting at 6 th level, you may instead use this feature to summon a Champion of the Heartwood. If you do so, then the sacrificed fervidite must be worth at least 75 gold pieces. Starting at 14 th level, you may instead use this feature to summon an Arbormancer of the Plant Lords. If you do so, then the sacrificed fervidite must be worth at least 200 gold pieces. Fortitude of the Plant Lords Starting at 6 th level, your connection to the pure life web of the Plant Lords has fortified your life energy. You gain advantage on death saving throws, and you gain resistance to radiant damage. Blessing of the Plant Lords Starting at 10 th level, your connection to the pure life web of the Plant Lords has further enhanced your life energy. You gain resistance to necrotic damage. If you are already resistant to necrotic damage or later become so from another source, then you instead become immune to necrotic damage. Improved Pact Ritual Starting at 14 th level, you may expend an elder warlock spell slot to use the Boon of the Plant Lords feature a second time before completing a long rest. Belisarda\u2019s First Children Starting at 20 th level, one of the greatest of the Plant Lords will personally heed your call to aid. Kratae, the Great Hawthorne, once a sapling offshoot of the first tree that sprang to life under Belisarda\u2019s love, is tasked to come to the aid of those who call through the life web. So long as you are adjacent to a space of bare earth or unworked stone large enough to contain it, as an action you may sacrifice fervidite worth at least 2000 gold pieces to summon Kratae, who appears in a space adjacent to you. Kratae is friendly to you and your allies, and it will generally follow any requests you make. It is a proud and ancient being, however, and will refuse to follow any direct orders or commands given to it. Kratae will also automatically seek to heal any living creature that is making death saving throws. Kratae will become hostile to anyone, including you and your allies, who kills any living thing within its sight. If someone successfully kills a living creature, then Kratae will make every attempt to knock that person unconscious and return to the Realm of the Plant Lords with the offender, keeping them imprisoned until they complete enough acts of penitence to appease Kratae. Kratae will return to its native realm once it is reduced to 0 hit points, an amount of time has passed equal to 10 minutes per 2000 gold pieces worth of fervidite sacrificed, or you use an action to send it home. You cannot use an action to send Kratae home if he is hostile to you or one of your allies. Once you use this feature, you can\u2019t use it again until you complete a long rest. For complete stats on these creatures see Chapter V: Bestiary.\u2003 The Green - the Plant Lords\u2019 Reluctant Final Boon Though reluctant to grant the following boon, the Plant Lords can be convinced that the unleashing of destructive forces is justified against those who threaten the balance of life itself. All things return to earth from whence it came. All living things follow this immutable law and even those things made from nonliving material must bow to the inevitable. The landscape of Arcanis is strewn with the bleached bones of fallen empires, crumbled kingdoms, and the ashes of monuments, though it can take many years, centuries, or even millennia for nature to reclaim what was once hers. This ritual accelerates the natural processes, calling upon the vibrant force of life to breakdown and reabsorbs anything and everything in its path. The Green is nature run amok; inexorable and undiscriminating of anything within its reach. Plant shoots erupt through feet of concrete or wood, constricting and crushing whatever is within its tendrils. Any living materials, from animals to sentient beings, are violently absorbed into the green mass; drowning them in a sea of foliage. The tallest of towers will be toppled, the thickest walls rent, and whatever blemish was made upon the earth shall be expunged, leaving behind a virgin landscape of a primordial forest. You may enact this terrible ritual within five miles of your target by spending 15 minutes in uninterrupted incantation and sacrificing your life and your soul. Once payment is made and the final words of intonation are uttered, a large, primordial forest quickly grows in the area. Seemingly ancient plants sprout from the earth in a matter of moments, transforming the area into a lush, verdant paradise. All buildings and man-made structures in the area are slowly, but relentlessly destroyed as they are torn apart by massive roots, vines, and limbs. Even living creatures in the area are not spared as they choke on pollen or are strangled by fast-moving vines. Others affected by the ritual itself are absorbed into the Green, their","title":"Elder Warlock"},{"location":"homerules/homerules/classes/elder-sorcerer/#eldritch-sorcerer","text":"Arcane magic taps into the residual energy of Creation to achieve miraculous and often mind-bending effects. This gives these ancient practitioners mastery over such exotic effects as creating an object out of thin air, changing the very essence of one thing to another, or tapping directly into the raw building blocks of reality (such as the Elemental Planes). The Eldritch Tradition is the magic used by most of the younger races of Arcanis, such as humanity and ss\u2019ressen. Like the Elder Tradition, eldritch sorcerers funnel the residual power of Creation through themselves, channeling it to perform a desired effect through sheer force of will. To illuminate the differences, masters of the Eldritch Tradition explain to their students that elder sorcerers are able to form and maintain a long equation, manipulate it, and even complete it, all without the help of paper and stylus.

Archery \u00b6 You gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls you make with ranged weapons. Canny Defense \u00b6 While not wearing armor, your AC equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Intelligence modifier. You can use shields and still gain this benefit. Defense \u00b6 While you are wearing armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC. Defensive Duelist \u00b6 While using a one-handed weapon while leaving your off hand completely free (including not holding a shield), any time you are the target of a melee attack you may use your reaction to gain a +2 bonus to your AC until the beginning of your next turn. Dueling \u00b6 When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon. Great Weapon Fighting \u00b6 When you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for an attack you make with a melee weapon that you are wielding with two hands, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll, even if the new roll is a 1 or a 2. The weapon must have the two-handed or versatile property for you to gain this benefit. Knife Fighter \u00b6 Any time you successfully hit with a dagger or knife you deal +2 damage. Additionally, if you have a hand free you may draw up to two daggers as part of any attack. Protection \u00b6 When a creature you can see attacks a target other than you that is within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on the attack roll. You must be wielding a shield. Pugilist \u00b6 Your unarmed strike now deals 1d4 + your Strength modifier in bludgeoning damage. As long as you have a free hand, any time you take the Attack action, you can make an unarmed strike as a bonus action. Two-Weapon Fighting \u00b6 When you engage in two-weapon fighting, you can add your ability modifier to the damage of the second attack. Additionally, you can draw or stow two one-handed weapons when you would normally be able to draw or stow one. The Tactician \u00b6 Strategic Mind \u00b6 You have a particularly sharp mind for tactics, possessing the ability to quickly adapt your stratagem to the flow of battle. With this insight, you can guide your allies, allowing them to position themselves and gain advantage where once there was none. During combat, whenever a friendly creature that can see or hear you begins their turn within 60 feet of you, you can gains a Command die, a d6, which they can spend when performing actions in pursuit of your suggested tactic. A suggested tactic must be a specific task such as \u2018shove that creature\u2019, \u2018cast a spell at that ss\u2019ressen\u2019, \u2018withdraw from melee\u2019, or \u2018attack that target\u2019, not \u201ckill them all\u201d or \u201cwin this battle!\u201d. Once within the next 10 minutes, your ally can add your Command Die to any attack roll, ability check, damage roll, or saving throw made in pursuit of your suggested tactic. Your ally can wait until after they roll a d20 before deciding to use the Command die, but must decide before the GM says whether the roll succeeds or fails. Once the Command die is rolled, it is lost. A creature can have only one Command die at a time. If your ally does not perform the suggested tactic or is somehow unable to do so, the die is returned to your command die pool after 10 minutes. For example, if you suggest that your ally knock a guard prone, they can only use your Command die on attack rolls or ability checks to knock down the guard. If for some reason that guard is killed or already knocked prone by the time your ally\u2019s turn comes up, the die is not spent and returned to your pool. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (a minimum of once). You regain any expended uses when you finish a short rest. Your Command die changes when you reach certain levels in the fighter class. The die becomes a d8 at 5 th level, a d10 at 10 th level, and a d12 at 15 th level. Student of History \u00b6 Once you reach 3 rd level you gain proficiency in the History skill. If you were already proficient with History, you add double your proficiency bonus on all ability checks that benefit from your proficiency in the History skill. Tactical Maneuvers \u00b6 At 3 rd level you learn three Tactical Maneuvers, from the list presented below. You learn an additional maneuver when you reach 7 th , 10 th , and 15 th level. Tactical Maneuvers are powered through the use of tactical points. Additionally, anytime you gain a fighter level you may switch one of your Tactical Maneuvers for another. If any of your Tactical Maneuvers requires a saving throw, that saving throw is equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + Intelligence modifier. Tactical Points \u00b6 You gain 3 tactical points to power your Tactical Maneuvers. You gain an additional tactical point upon reaching 7 th , 10 th , and 15 th level in the fighter class. You regain all spent tactical points after completing a short or long rest. Tactical Maneuvers \u00b6 Brutal Ambush: When you and your allies catch an enemy by surprise the results are simply devastating. When you attack a surprised creature, you may spend 1 tactical point as a reaction to grant all friendly creatures within 30 feet who can hear or see you advantage on their next attack roll before the end of their next turn. Distracting Strike: With an attack, you draw a creature\u2019s attention, allowing your allies to disengage safely. When you hit a creature with a melee attack, you may spend 1 tactical point to prevent that creature from taking reactions until the end of your next turn. Hammer and Anvil: You set up a combined attack, trapping your opponent between you and your allies. As an action, you may make a single melee weapon attack and, if you hit, you may spend 2 tactical points to force that creature to make a Wisdom saving throw. If your target fails, they immediately provoke an opportunity attack from any single friendly creature of your choice that is adjacent to the creature you struck. Knight\u2019s Move: You position yourself and an ally into an advantageous position. Immediately after making an opportunity attack, you may spend 1 tactical point to allow a single friendly creature within 30 feet who can hear and see you to instantly move 15 feet. On My Mark: Sometimes it\u2019s best to lead by example. As part of an attack action, you may spend 1 tactical point to grant a single ally within 30 feet who can hear and see you advantage on their next attack roll against the creature you attack. If your ally successfully hits with this attack they deal an additional 1d6 damage. This damage increases to 1d8 when you reach 5 th level, 11 th level becomes 1d10 and finally, 1d12 at 17 th level. Rallying Cry: You call upon your allies and inspire them to greater acts of heroism. As an action, you may spend 2 tactical points to grant all friendly creatures within 60 feet who can hear or see you a number of temporary hit points equal to 1d10 + your Intelligence modifier. These temporary hit points fade away after 1 minute. Stand your Ground: With a shout, you command your allies to set themselves to receive a charge. When a creature moves within 10 feet of you or an ally within 30 feet of you, as a reaction you can call out to your allies to be ready for an attack. You spend 1 tactical point and all friendly creatures within 30 feet who can hear or see you gain resistance against bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from non-magical weapons until the end of their next turn. Strategic Maneuver: In battle, positioning is everything. As a bonus action, you may spend 1 tactical point to let a friendly creature within 60 feet who can hear or see you use their reaction to move up to their speed. Strike the Rod: You can put the fear of a training sergeant into your allies, helping them to shake off lesser fears. Whenever one of your allies becomes frightened, as a reaction you can help them regain their composure. You spend 1 tactical point and all friendly creatures within 60 feet who can hear or see you can make a new saving throw to shake off any effect which has resulted in the frightened condition. If the effect that granted the frightened condition does not grant a saving throw, your allies must make a DC: 20 Charisma saving throw to remove the frightened condition. Tempting Target: By making yourself a target for an attack, you force your opponent to overextend, leaving a perfect opening for your allies. When you take the Attack action, you may spend 1 tactical point as a bonus action to force a creature within your reach to make a Wisdom saving throw. If your target fails its saving throw, all friendly creatures who saw the attack gain advantage on their next attack roll against your target. Regardless of the result of the saving throw, if the target attacks anyone other than you during its next turn it suffers disadvantage on their attack roll Warning Shout: You warn your allies to dive for cover! When a friendly creature within 60 feet who can hear and see you is the target of a spell, you can use your reaction to shout a warning to them. You spend 1 tactical point and that creature gains advantage on their saving throw against the triggering spell. If the spell has no save your ally gains resistance against the triggering spell\u2019s damage instead. Cry Havoc \u00b6 At 10 th level, when rolling initiative, you may spend 1 tactical point to grant all allies who can see or hear you within 60 feet advantage on their initiative roll. Once this feature is used it may not be used again until you complete a long rest. Crescendo of Violence \u00b6 Once you reach 15 th level any time you score a critical hit you instantly regain a use of Strategic Mind or 1 tactical point (your choice). Tactical Awareness \u00b6 Upon reaching 18 th level if you start combat with no uses of Strategic Mind or no tactical points, you instantly recover one of each.","title":"\u0411\u043e\u0435\u0446 (\u0432\u043e\u0438\u043d)"},{"location":"homerules/homerules/classes/fighter/#fighter-arcanis","text":"","title":"Fighter (Arcanis)"},{"location":"homerules/homerules/classes/fighter/#fighting-style","text":"You adopt a particular style of fighting as your specialty.
