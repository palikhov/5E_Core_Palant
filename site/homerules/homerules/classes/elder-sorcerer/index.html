<p>Arcane magic taps into the residual energy of Creation to 
achieve miraculous and often mind-bending effects. This 
gives these ancient practitioners mastery over such exotic 
effects as creating an object out of thin air, changing the 
very essence of one thing to another, or tapping directly 
into the raw building blocks of reality, such as the 
Elemental Planes.
The Elder Tradition of magic is practiced by the elder 
races of Arcanis, such as the ssanu, il’Huan, and the elorii. 
Elder magic tends to be meticulous and precise, befitting 
races that are so long lived that a decade is a reasonable 
amount of time to have a discussion.
What differentiates elder magic from the eldritch magic 
practiced by the younger races, such as humans, is the 
precision in which the raw energy is manifested. Though 
this assiduous attention to detail makes 
elder magic potent, it is much slower to 
cast than its eldritch counterpart.
Many wise and intelligent humans 
have tried to master the Elder Tradition 
but the rare individual that comes near 
to succeeding have been driven mad. 
Many speculate that the human mind 
lacks certain physiology that the elder 
races possess and are thus incapable of 
mastering this tradition.

<p>can choose one of the spells you know and replace it with 
another from the elder sorcerer spell list, which also must be 
of a level for which you have spell slots.
Spellcasting Ability 
Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your elder 
sorcerer spells. Your magic comes from your knowledge 
and study of the universe. You can use your Intelligence 
whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In 
addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting 
the saving throw DC for an elder sorcerer spell you cast and 
when making an attack roll with one.
Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus +<br />
your Intelligence modifier
Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus +<br />
your Intelligence modifier
Elder Ritual Casting
You can cast any elder sorcerer spell you know as a ritual 
if that spell has the ritual tag. When you cast an elder 
sorcerer spell as a ritual, it takes 15 minutes to cast instead 
of the normal time, but the spell’s duration is doubled. 
Spellcasting Focus
You can use an arcane focus as a spellcasting focus for your 
elder sorcerer spells.
Arcane Recovery
You have learned to regain some of your magical energy 
through meditative practices and ceremonies. Once per day 
when you finish a short rest, you can choose expended spell 
slots to recover. The spell slots can have a combined level that 
is equal to or less than half your elder sorcerer level (rounded 
up), and none of the slots can be of 6<sup>th</sup> level or higher. 
For example, if you’re a 4<sup>th</sup> level elder sorcerer, you can 
recover up to two levels worth of spell slots. You can either 
recover a 2<sup>nd</sup>-level spell slot or two 1<sup>st</sup>-level spell slots.
Elder Sorcerer Tradition       <br />
When you reach 2<sup>nd</sup> level, you choose an arcane tradition, 
shaping your magical practice. The traditions are detailed 
at the end of this chapter. Your choice grants you features 
at 2<sup>nd</sup> level and again at 6<sup>th</sup>, 10<sup>th</sup>, and 14<sup>th</sup> level.
Arcane Flexibility
At 3<sup>rd</sup> level, you learn how to mold and shape your spells 
as you cast them. You gain 2 arcane points and you gain 
more arcane points as you reach higher levels in this class, 
as shown in the Arcane Points column of the Elder Sorcerer 
table. You can never have more arcane points than shown 
on the table for your level. You regain all spent arcane 
points when you finish a long rest. 
See Chapter VI: Magic of Arcanis for more 
information on arcane points and how to use them.</p>
<p>Metamagic 
Starting at 3<sup>rd</sup> level, you gain the ability to twist your spells 
to suit your needs. You learn the Metamagic option Subtle 
Spell. You also gain one other Metamagic option of your 
choice and you gain another one at 7<sup>th</sup> level.
You can only use one Metamagic option on a spell when 
you cast it, unless otherwise noted.
See Chapter VI: Magic of Arcanis for a complete list of 
Metamagic options and how to use to use them.
Ability Score Improvement
When you reach 4<sup>th</sup> level, and again at 8<sup>th</sup>, 12<sup>th</sup> and 16<sup>th</sup> 
and 19<sup>th</sup> level, you can increase one ability score of your 
choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your 
choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability over 20 
by using this feature.
Meticulous Spell Shaping
Starting at 5<sup>th</sup> level, whenever you cast an elder sorcerer 
spell that forces other creatures to make a saving throw, 
you can protect some of those creatures from the spell’s 
full force. To do so, you spend 1 arcane point and choose a 
number of those creatures up to your Intelligence modifier 
(minimum of 1). A chosen creature automatically succeeds 
on its saving throw against your spell. 
When you reach 9<sup>th</sup> level in this class, chosen creatures 
have resistance to your spell’s damage. When you reach 
13<sup>th</sup> level, chosen creatures take no damage from your spell.
Reclaim Control 
Starting at 7<sup>th</sup> level, any time you lose concentration on a 
spell that summons a creature, such as conjure elemental, 
you may, as a reaction, spend 2 arcane points to force the 
creatures your summoned to make a Charisma saving throw.
If a creature you summoned with the triggering spell 
fails their saving throw, you regain your concentration 
on the spell and control over your summoned creatures. 
Any creature that succeeds on their saving throw resists 
your control, even if you regain your concentration on the 
triggering spell.
Elder Ritualist
Starting at 18<sup>th</sup> level, you can cast any elder sorcerer spell 
that you know of 6<sup>th</sup> level or below that does not require 
concentration as a ritual spell. 
Signature Spells
When you reach 20<sup>th</sup> level, you gain mastery over three 
powerful spells and can cast them with little effort. Choose 
a 1<sup>st</sup> level elder sorcerer spell, a 2<sup>nd</sup> level elder sorcerer spell, 
and a 3<sup>rd</sup> level elder sorcerer spell that you know as your 
signature spells. You can cast these spells at their lowest level 
without expending a spell slot. If you want to cast these spells </p>
<p>Arc anis 5e • Chap ter 2: Cl a sse s 78</p>
<p>at a higher level, you must expend a spell slot as normal.
By spending 8 hours in study, you can exchange any of 
the spells you chose for different spells of the same level.
Elder Sorcerer Traditions 
Spellcasters in the Elder Tradition devote entire lifetimes 
to the perfection of one spell or mastering one school of 
magic. Such dedication takes time, but for an immortal 
race time is an endless resource. 
Arcanist 
The Arcanist does not seek to master a single aspect of the 
arcane arts but rather the techniques of casting spells. They 
seek to master a spell’s placement and refine its use; they 
seek enlightenment within the pull and push of the forces 
used to create the effect. An Arcanist seeks to perfect their 
art through skillful and thoughtful execution. 
Arcane Precision
Starting at 3<sup>rd</sup> level, as a bonus action you can spend 1 
arcane point to grant yourself advantage on your next spell 
attack roll. 
Expanded Knowledge 
At 6<sup>th</sup> level, you learn an additional Metamagic option 
of your choice. See Chapter VI: Magic of Arcanis for a 
complete list of Metamagic options. 
Elder Efficiency 
Beginning at 10<sup>th</sup> level, any time you cast a spell of 3<sup>rd</sup> 
level or higher using a spell slot of a slot level higher than 
required for the spell, you regain 2 expended arcane points. 
Refined Metamagic 
Starting at 14<sup>th</sup> level, you can manipulate spells with 
little effort. Choose one Metamagic option you know that 
requires 2 or less arcane points to use. You may now use 
that Metamagic option three times when you cast an elder 
sorcerer spell without expending arcane points, regaining all 
expended uses of this feature when you complete a long rest.
Conjurer 
Conjurers focus on calling forth elementals and other 
servants. Many elorii devote themselves to the study of 
conjuration as their birthright as scions of the lost Elemental 
Lords. Other elorii see elementals as useful and even willing 
tools in the battle to restore their place in the world. 
Elemental Servant
Starting at 2<sup>nd</sup> level you gain the services of an elemental 
servant. You learn the spell find familiar and may use it to </p>
<p>summon an elemental servant instead of a familiar. See 
Appendix 1: Bestiary for your elemental servant’s stats.
Your elemental servant gains all the benefits of your 
Elemental Companion feature. You can have only one 
elemental servant at a time. 
Unlike a normal familiar, when you dismiss your 
elemental servant, it returns to the Elemental Plane it came 
from but does not regain any lost hit points or spent hit 
die until it spends at least 8 hours on its home plane. Your 
elemental servant will then regain all of its hit points and 
spent hit dice.
If your elemental servant is ever slain, you may not 
summon a new one until you complete long rest. The 
elemental servant you then summon is not the same one 
you had before, it is a new creature.
Elemental Companion
Your elemental servant gains a variety of benefits. 
When you take the Attack action, you can forgo one of 
your own attacks to allow your elemental servant to make 
one attack, using its reaction. Starting at 11<sup>th</sup> level, as a 
bonus action you can have your elemental servant make one 
attack, using its reaction. 
If you are incapacitated, your elemental servant will 
only take actions to protect you. If you are absent, your 
elemental servant will follow the last set of commands you 
gave it.
Your elemental servant adds your proficiency bonus to 
attack rolls and saving throws. 
For each sorcerer level you gain after 5<sup>th</sup>, your elemental 
servant gains an additional hit die and increases its 
maximum hit points by 5.
Master Summoner
At 6<sup>th</sup> level, you are adept at calling forth creatures from 
the Elemental Planes. Any time you cast a spell that calls 
forth one or more elementals, you can spend 2 arcane 
points to give the elementals you summon the following 
benefits:
• Your summoned elementals add your proficiency bonus 
to their AC and damage rolls.
• Your summoned elementals have advantage on all 
saving throws.
• Your summoned elementals have the maximum 
possible hit points for their hit dice.
Elemental Infusion
At 10<sup>th</sup> level, you have learned how to use your spells to 
heal your elemental companions. You can target either your 
elemental servant or an elemental you have called forth with 
an elder sorcerer spell and expend one of your spell slots to 
restore hit points to it. 
The amount of hit points you restore to the elemental 
is based on the level of the spell slot you expend. If you expend a 1<sup>st</sup> level spell slot you restore 1d8 + your Intelligence modifier. For every slot level above the 1<sup>st</sup> that you expend, the healing increases by 1d8.
Conjurer’s Grace 
At 14<sup>th</sup> level, you have mastered the art of summoning. You no longer need to make a concentration check when you take damage while concentrating on a spell that calls forth one or more elementals. 
Elorii Elementalist 
Created through a combination of ssanu technomancy, elemental magic, and the essence of a goddess, the elorii have a unique elemental resonance. As masters of the Arcanum and practitioners of the complex and demanding 
Elder Tradition, it was only a matter of time before the elorii started to experiment with their own elemental nature. Like a master musician finding the right note, elorii elementalists learn to modify and focus the resonance within them, amplifying it tenfold. 
Elorii elementalists master their magic through deep introspection. They strive to fully comprehend their elemental nature and learn how to pull upon the potency of their ancestry to enhance their spells.
Racial Restriction: Only elorii may become elorii elementalists. As you gain levels in the elder sorcerer class you must choose the elemental powers pertaining to your sub-race.
The Element of Air 
(Osalikene) 
Magic sings through you like chimes on the wind, 
empowering your body and magic with unparalleled grace. 
I Am the Wind
Starting at 2<sup>nd</sup> level, you can tap into your elemental 
nature to empower your spells and dodge attacks before 
they hit you. 
When not wearing armor or wielding a shield, your AC is 
equal to 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Blood Rank.
In addition, you can use either your Blood Rank or your 
Intelligence as your spellcasting ability modifier for your 
elder sorcerer spells, whichever is higher. This does not 
change any other feature of the elder sorcerer class that 
relies on Intelligence (such as Metamagic). 
The Wind Forever at My Back
At 6<sup>th</sup> level, the winds surround you at all times. You 
can cast jump and featherfall on yourself at will, without 
expending a spell slot or material components. Additionally, 
you have advantage on all Constitution checks to maintain 
concentration on fly. </p>
<p>Elemental Nature 
At 10<sup>th</sup> level you deepen your connection to your elemental 
nature and the forces of the air. As an action, you may 
spend 2 arcane points to gain immunity to lightning 
damage for 1 hour. 
Also, any spell you cast that deals lightning damage 
ignores resistance to that kind of damage. Finally, when you 
roll damage for a spell that deals lightning damage you deal 
additional damage equal to your Blood Rank.
I Am the Whirlwind 
Upon reaching 14<sup>th</sup> level you learn how to fully express 
your elemental nature, if only for a short time. As a bonus 
action, you can expend 5 arcane points and take on some of 
the qualities of an air elemental for 1 hour. 
For the duration, you gain the following benefits: 
Damage Resistances: thunder; bludgeoning, piercing, 
and slashing from nonmagical attacks
Damage Immunities: lightning; poison
Condition Immunities: exhaustion, grappled, paralyzed, 
petrified, poisoned, prone, restrained, unconscious
The Element of Earth
(Mârokene) 
You embody the elemental power of stone. Its resonance 
channels through you, empowering your body and crushing 
your foes.
I Am the Stone
Starting at 2<sup>nd</sup> level, you can tap into your elemental 
nature to empower your spells and make your skin as 
durable as stone. 
When not wearing armor or wielding a shield, your AC 
is equal to 10 + your Constitution modifier + your Blood 
Rank.
In addition, you can use either your Blood Rank or 
your Intelligence as your spellcasting ability for your elder 
sorcerer spells, whichever is higher. This does not change 
any other feature of the elder sorcerer class that relies on 
Intelligence (such as Metamagic). 
The Avalanche 
Starting at 6<sup>th</sup> level, you can attack twice, instead of once, 
whenever you take the Attack action on your turn. 
Also, as a bonus action you may spend 1 arcane point 
to imbue your body with the strength of the earth. For 1

arcanum, a strange manipulation of the powers of Creation

your weapon to force damage.

At 1<sup>st</sup> level, you have learned the necessary rites to call upon ancient pacts. The following pacts are for elorii heroes only and are made with the elemental lord associated with your bloodline. You are granted features at 1<sup>st</sup> level and again at 3<sup>rd</sup>, 6<sup>th</sup>, 10<sup>th</sup>, 14<sup>th</sup>, and 20<sup>th</sup> level. While this book focuses upon elorii, pacts for other elder casters will be details in future products.
Sorcerous Pact Magic
Your arcane research and exposure to the practices of ancient pacts have given you facility with a number of spells from the elder warlock spell list.
Cantrips
You know two cantrips of your choice from the elder warlock spell list. You learn additional elder warlock Cantrips of your choice from the elder warlock spell list at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Elder Warlock table.
Sped Slots
The elder warlock table shows how many spell slots you have. The table also shows what the level of those slots is; all of your spell slots are the same level. To cast one of your elder warlock spells of 1<sup>st</sup> level or higher, you must expend a spell slot. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a short or long rest. For example, when you are 5<sup>th</sup> level, you have two 3<sup>rd</sup>-level spell slots. To cast the 1<sup>st</sup>-level spell color spray, you must spend one of those slots, and you cast it as a 3<sup>rd</sup>-level spell.
Spells Known of 1<sup>st</sup> Level and Higher
At 1<sup>st</sup> level, you know two 1<sup>st</sup>-level spells of your choice from the elder warlock spell list. The Spells Known column of the Elder Warlock table shows when you learn more elder warlock spells of your choice of 1<sup>st</sup> level and higher. A spell you choose must be of a level no higher than what’s shown in the table’s Slot Level column for your level. When you reach 6<sup>th</sup> level, for example, you learn a new elder warlock spell, which can be 1<sup>st</sup>, 2<sup>nd</sup>, or 3<sup>rd</sup> level.</p>
<p>Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the elder warlock spells you know and replace it with another spell from the elder warlock list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.
Spellcasting Ability
Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your elder warlock spells, so you use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, your Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier and your Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier.
Spellcasting Focus
You can use an arcane focus as a spellcasting focus for your elder warlock spells.
Arcane Invocations
In your study of arcane lore, you have mastered Arcane Invocations, rituals that imbue you with magical abilities. At 2<sup>nd</sup> level, you gain two invocations of your choice. Your invocation options are detailed at the end of the class description. When you gain certain elder warlock levels, you gain additional invocations of your choice, as shown in the Invocations Known column of the elder warlock table. Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the invocations you know and replace it with another invocation that you could learn at that level.
Note that the use of any invocation with an obviously magical effect may draw the attention of Ymandragore just as if you had cast an arcane spell. At the gamemaster’s discretion, you may activate an invocation with subtlety as if you had cast an arcane spell of a level equal to your elder warlock spell slot levels.
Elder Arcanum
At 11<sup>th</sup> level, your studies into ancient magic and pacts allow you to discover an arcane secret called an Elder Arcanum. Choose one 6<sup>th</sup>- level spell from the elder warlock spell list as this arcanum. You can cast your arcanum spell once without expending a spell slot. You must finish a long rest before you can do so again. At higher levels, you gain more elder warlock spells of your choice that can be cast in this way: one 7<sup>th</sup>- level spell at 13<sup>th</sup> level, one 8<sup>th</sup>-level spell at 15<sup>th</sup> level, and one 9<sup>th</sup>-level spell at 17<sup>th</sup> level.

<p>The Mad King of the Crushing Depths (Berokene)
The most detailed notes left behind by the dread ssanu sorcerers of the Black Coil dealt with traveling to a watery realm known as the Crushing Deep.
This elemental sphere was many times removed from the Mortal Realm that Arcanis resides within, but seemed to be accessible, unlike the Inner Elemental Realms, which were barred to Telas.
Anticipating the need to carry over his own breathable atmosphere and some way to fend off the immense pressure promised by the name of the realm, Telas toiled for months before perfecting a new spell he dubbed the cloak of life. He believed that when the spell was cast, it would protect him from whatever inhospitable environment he would find on his travels.
Putting faith in his mastery of the arcane arts, Telas cast his newly crafted spell of protection and opened the way to the Realm of the Crushing Deep. Instantly, he was immersed in inky blackness and the vast pressure from the many tons of water above him constricted his chest and made his head pound, despite his precaution.
Slowly, the archmage’s eyes adjusted to the dimness and he began to see phosphorescent trails and spots glowing all about him. This faint light revealed that he was in a place consisting almost entirely of ocean water with a few mountain-sized islands floating at different depths.
Suddenly, he saw shapes resolve themselves from the gloom. At first, he feared that he had made an error and blundered into a lost ssanu stronghold, for the creatures moving speedily towards him possessed a torso much like his, but with lower extremities that lashed back and forth like a serpent’s tail. Steadying his nerves, knowing full well that any attempt to flee 
and elude his pursuers was hopeless, Telas readied himself and was relieved to find that though the beings before him had a passing similarity in physiology to the elorii’s ancient serpentine masters, they were of a new and unknown species. After demanding that he identify himself and answer their questions, they were eventually convinced that the archmage was not hostile and, though they politely refused to answer his queries, they escorted him towards the floating landmasses.
Upon the largest of these submerged islands Telas found the demesne of the so-called Mad King of the Crushing Deep. Though quite insane by any elorii (or human) standard, the Mad King was also relatively affable and curious about those “without” visiting his domain. When first addressed by Telas, the Mad King was amazed at the existence of the elorii. Though he had not heard of an entity named Beroe or any of the other Elemental Lords, he became instantly curious about the Berokene cousins of Telas, the archmage being a Kelekene.
After some time, Telas ended his visit with a bargain struck on behalf of Berokene that were versed in elemental sorcery. For a price, (for the Mad King and all his subjects placed great value on fire opals that existed nowhere in that realm, he and his retainers </p>
<p>would honor the oaths made with Telas and offer aid and even succor to those who called upon them.
You have invoked the Ancient Pact with the Mad King of the Crushing Depths. In return for gifts of fire opals, a rare commodity in the Mad King’s realm, he is willing to send you aid. This connection has additionally channeled and influenced your arcane studies into focusing on your elemental bloodline’s connection to those cold depths.
Expanded Sped List
The Mad King of the Crushing Depths lets you choose from an expanded list of Spells when you learn an elder warlock spell. The following spells are added to the elder warlock spell list for you. Spells marked with f are found in the Arcanis 5e Campaign Setting and spells marked with a * are new spells found in Chapter IV: Elder Magic of Arcanis.

•   It may breathe underwater.
•   It can move through a space as narrow as 1 inch wide without squeezing.

Starting at 1<sup>st</sup> level, you learn the elemental blast cantrip, which does not count against your total elder warlock cantrips known. It deals your choice of Cold or Slashing damage, chosen at the time of casting, and the beams are made of freezing, ink-dark water.
Boon of the Mad King of the Crushing Depths
Starting at 3<sup>rd</sup> level, The Mad King of the Crushing Depths has agreed to allow you to summon warriors from his realm. As an action, you may expend an elder warlock spell slot and sacrifice fire opals worth at least 10 gold pieces to summon a Warrior of the Crashing Waves, which appears in an unoccupied space next to you. The Warrior of the Crashing Waves is friendly to you and will disappear when it drops to 0 hit points, after it has served you for one hour, or if you dismiss it as an action. It will also disappear if it is successfully targeted by a casting of dispel magic (or a similar spell or effect) capable of dispelling a spell cast with your elder warlock spell slot. Until the Warrior of the Crashing Waves disappears, you cannot maintain concentration on any spell which conjures or summons a creature or creatures. The Warrior of the Crashing Waves will obey your verbal commands, requiring no action, so long as you share a language with it. If you issue no commands, then the Warrior of the Crashing Waves will attack any creature it sees that is obviously hostile to you. Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you complete a long rest. The action used to activate this feature may be interrupted by counterspell as if it were a spell cast with your elder warlock spell slot, in which case the elder warlock spell slot is still expended but the fire opals are not sacrificed, and this feature is not considered to have been used.
Starting at 6<sup>th</sup> level, you may instead use this feature to summon an Ice Giant Champion of Gayal. If you do so, then the sacrificed fire opals must be worth at least 75 gold pieces.
Starting at 14<sup>th</sup> level, you may instead use this feature to summon an Aquamancer from the Crushing Deep. If you do so, then the sacrificed fire opals must be worth at least 200 gold pieces. </p>
<p>Starting at 6<sup>th</sup> level, your connection to the realm of the Mad King of the Crushing Depths has fortified you against that which is anathema to your elemental nature and the nature of his realm. You gain resistance to fire damage.

Starting at 14<sup>th</sup> level, you may expend an elder warlock spell slot to use the Boon of the Mad King of the Crushing Waves feature a second time before completing a long rest.
The Mad King&rsquo;s Steed
Starting at 20<sup>th</sup> level, the Mad King has favored you by allowing the summoning of his personal mount, Vardaka, the Megalodon. So long as you are adjacent to a body of water large enough to contain her, as an action you may sacrifice fire opals worth at least 2000 gold pieces to summon Vardaka, who appears in a space of water adjacent to you. Vardaka is friendly to you and your allies, though her frenzy ability may lead to her attacking an ally by mistake.
She will disappear when she drops to 0 hit points or after she has served you for 10 minutes for every 2000 gold pieces in value of the sacrificed fire opals. Vardaka is equipped with a strangely modified saddle, and she will allow a single being specified by you to ride her. Vardaka is an intelligent mount and follows the normal mounted combat rules for riding an intelligent creature. She will obey her rider’s commands unless her frenzy ability specifies otherwise.
Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you complete a long rest.

Tsunami - the Mad King&rsquo;s Reluctant Final Boon

<p>The Tiar of the Realm
of the Swift Zephyrs (Osalikene)
After his remarkable journey to the Realm of the Crushing Deep, Telas was emboldened to continue traveling to different realms in the hopes of finding some trace of the lost Eloran deities.
Reviewing even more ancient ssanu documents left behind by their former scaled masters, he found mention of a place known as the Realm of the Swift Zephyrs. The term ‘zephyrs’ was one used by Lord Osalian when describing
some of the denizens that</p>
<p>existed in His domain and this spurred hope that he could find some trace of the elorii gods.
Having already learned how to peel back the barriers that separate the Mortal Realm from others, Telas was soon transported to the Realm of the Swift Zephyrs and immediately found himself falling as if from a tremendous height. Struggling to tap down his rising panic, he quickly surveyed the area about him, and but for the deep lavender sky and quickly moving clouds, he saw nothing else. No land or ocean were within view and whatever he was falling towards must be so far below as to be invisible to his eye.
Whether it was his presence or the strangled screams that escaped his lips, regardless of the efforts made to maintain control of his fears, large patches of pastel hued “clouds” seemed to form about him and slowed his descent. Within seconds, the archmage found himself upon a miraculously semi-solid cloudbank that stretched in all directions for what seemed to be leagues.
At first Telas believed himself alone, but he soon noticed a portion of the air before him zipping and whizzing about him and a low buzzing nagged at his ears. Slowly, a form began to coalesce, though it still refused to remain in one place.
”Canyouunderstandusmw,creature?” a voice asked from in front, to the side and then above him.
Beginning to understand what was happening, Telas spoke as quickly as his mouth could form the words and still be intelligible. “Yes, though the people of my Realm do not move or speak as quickly as you do. Please slow down so that we may communicate. ”
With great effort the multi- formed image merged into one, revealing a tall and slender entity of breathtaking beauty.
Telas thought of
the being as a “her”, though in fact the Zephyrs do not possess a gender. With great effort, his rescuer explained, in what must have been a glacially slow manner for her, that he was indeed in the Realm of the Swift Zephyrs and that he was at the outskirts of the domain of Tiar Sur’hy of the Zephyrs; Tiar being some sort of honorific similar to a Lord or iMNg.
Traveling on a mixture of solidified air and clouds, Telas eventually met with Tiar Sur’hy who expressed astonishment at 
discovering the elorii. Like the Mad King of the Crushing Deep, Sur’hy possessed no knowledge of Holy Osalian. The Tiar explained that travel between the Realms was rare but not unheard of as they had had periodic contact with Lord Gorum and assisted him during the War. When Telas asked about the War, the Tiar became suspicious and the archmagi thought it best to change the subject.
After negotiating a similar bargain for the Osalikene as he did for the Berokene, Telas resolved to gain an audience with Lord Gorum and his Realm of the Solid Sky.
You have invoked the Ancient Pact with the Tiar of the Realm of the Swift Zephyrs. In return for gifts of diamonds, a rare commodity in the Tiar’s realm, she is willing to send you aid.

Boon of the Tiar of the Realm of the Swift Zephyrs
Starting at 3<sup>rd</sup> level, The Tiar of the Realm of the Swift Zephyrs has agreed to allow you to summon </p>
<p>warriors from her realm. As an action, you may expend an elder warlock spell slot and sacrifice diamonds worth at least 10 gold pieces to summon a Zephyr Warrior, which appears in an unoccupied space next to you. The Zephyr Warrior is friendly to you and will disappear when it drops to 0 hit points, after it has served you for one hour, or if you dismiss it as an action. It will also disappear if it is successfully targeted by a casting of dispel magic (or a similar spell or effect) capable of dispelling a spell cast with your elder warlock spell slot. Until the Zephyr Warrior disappears, you cannot maintain concentration on any spell which conjures or summons a creature or creatures. The Zephyr Warrior will obey your verbal commands, requiring no action, so long as you share a language with it. If you issue no commands, then the Zephyr Warrior will attack any creature it sees which is obviously hostile to you. Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you complete a long rest. The action used to activate this feature may be interrupted by counterspell as if it were a spell cast with your elder warlock spell slot, in which case the elder warlock spell slot is still expended but the diamonds are not sacrificed, and this feature is not considered to have been used.
Starting at 6<sup>th</sup> level, you may instead use this feature to summon a Slayer of the Steel Wind. If you do so, then the sacrificed diamonds must be worth at least 75 gold pieces.

Starting at 20<sup>th</sup> level, the Tiar has favored you by allowing the summoning of her favorite pet, Granbeier the Bearded Vulture. So long as you are adjacent to a space large enough to contain it, as an action you may sacrifice diamonds worth at least 2000 gold pieces to summon Granbeier, who appears in a space adjacent to you. Granbeier is friendly to you and your allies and obeys your commands as if you were the Tiar herself.
It will disappear when it drops to 0 hit points or after it has served you for 10 minutes for every 2000 gold pieces in value of the sacrificed diamonds. So long as it was not dropped to 0 hit points, it will demand its own payment for its services ten minutes before it vanishes.
It asks you to provide it with carrion flesh equivalent to four medium creatures or one large creature. If you do not do so, then you must succeed on a DC 30 Charisma (Persuasion) check to convince Granbeier to leave without its reward. If you fail this roll and cannot provide the carrion it has demanded, then Granbeier will attack you and attempt to claim you for its meal before it vanishes.
Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you complete a long rest.
For complete stats on these creatures see Chapter V: Bestiary.
Hurricane - the Tiar&rsquo;s Reluctant Final Boon
The Tiar will only grant this boon if she is convinced that the need is dire. Once granted, she sends a score of the most powerful and vicious air elementals, known as the Storm Furies, to the area directed by the summoner and allows them to unleash their might.
Use of this rite should be given the utmost consideration as the vast storm summoned will not discriminate between friend and foe. Approximately fifty years ago, during the latter part of the Coryani Civil War, a deadly and destructive hurricane crashed upon the shores of Cafela and the city of Sweet Savona. The city was engaged in repelling invading forces when it was devastated by the storm as well. Between the casualties inflicted by the hurricane and the warring factions, Sweet Savona suffered the greatest loss of life of any battle of the Civil War. Some learned magi believe that the storm was a manifestation of this 
rite, so quickly did it materialize, but evidence to substantiate these claims was never discovered.
You may enact this terrible ritual within 5 miles of your target by spending 15 minutes in uninterrupted incantation and sacrificing your life and your soul. Once payment is made and the final words of intonation are uttered, a gentle breeze begins to blow in from the horizon. Within minutes, the wind grows to a deafening howl, and it continues to grow into a hurricane that covers 20 square miles.
Although most effective if used on a coastal region, the rite can create a devastating storm in any locale or time of year. For example, if used in a mountainous region during the winter, the storm will manifest as a brutal blizzard. The conjured storm covers a large area, easily big enough to envelop a large city and its environs. The targeted area is wracked by hurricane force winds (sustained winds or gusts in excess of 118 km/h, 74 mph), lightning strikes, and torrential rains. If the targeted area is a coastal one, then ocean surges in the range of ten to twenty feet can flood the area as well. Most wooden structures will be utterly destroyed, and unsheltered people and animals will be swept away; their shattered bodies found many miles away, if ever found at all. Buildings and other structures made of solid stone should survive the storm intact, but widespread damage and loss of life is likely even so. Anything and anyone in the area of the storm will be crushed by flying debris and their remains carried off as a massive gale purges almost everything from the land. The gamemaster should estimate that the effects of the storm will destroy anything not made from stone and will kill anyone not sheltered in such a structure in a ten square mile area.
You may only use this feature if you have learned in¬play the secret of speaking the Kurenthe curse. The use of this feature kills you and destroys your essence to fuel its power, and your death in this manner may not be mitigated or undone by anything short of direct, divine intervention. At the gamemaster’s discretion, the Tiar of the Realm of the Zephyrs may refuse to grant this boon or may ask an additional sacrifice or service before granting it.
Lord Gorum of the
Realm of the Solid Sky (Marokene)
The transition from the Realm of the Swift Zephyrs to the Realm of the Solid Sky was a relatively easy one given that Tiar Sur’hy and Lord Gorum appear to maintain cordial, if infrequent diplomatic relations 
monolithic giant tried to keep up with his answers.
“We walk upon the Path of the Ten Thousand,
Thousand Steps, which connects the entrance to Lord Gorum’s Realm with the ramparts. These crumbling walls and Lord Gorum’s Sentinels all are that stand between the structured order of the universe, as set by the Creator, and pure Chaos, which seeks to undo His great works. ”
The inquisitive elorii’s questions appeared to tax the monolith’s patience for it fell silent, as its massive stride chewed the distance to the entry to the Realm of the Solid Sky. Its final words were, “Lord Gorum will answer all of your questions, incessant one. ” The distance that they walked did not seem to bring them any closer to their destination, and after a time, Falladrin 
consented to carry the fragile mage along the way.
Exhausted, the archmage fell in a deep meditative trace sometime during their passage for when he awoke, he lay on a cobblestone floor. Cursing himself for his frailty, Telas quickly jumped to his feet. It was then that he noticed the gargantuan foot that was before him. He turned his gaze upward but was only able to see up to the being’s knees before the rest was lost in the darkness.
Suddenly, the portion of the floor upon which he stood shot upward, forcing him again to his knees. Within moments, he was before a face the size of the largest towers that once adorned Bright Belestor.
“I have adjusted the pressure of my Realm so as not to cause you discomfort, elorii. Have I misjudged your physical needs?”
Rising to his feet, Telas bowed deeply. “Not at all, Lord Gorum. L merely fell to my knees to better show my deference to your majesty. ” What at first Telas thought was a being seated upon a stone throne, was instead one entire creature; in fact, Telas began to wonder if the entire realm was but one complete sentient entity. As he observed, there seemed not to be a place where Lord Gorum ended and the throne began. He further noticed that the “throne” flowed directly from the floor and wall as if the “Lord Gorum” he saw was only a manifestation for his benefit. Telas began to form the theory that Lord Gorum and the Realm of the Solid Sky were one. Feeling that airing his hypothesis might be rude and detrimental to his health, Telas instead asked about the chaos that Falladrin mentioned.
“Know you so little of the Creation, little elorii?” Asked Gorum. “When the Creator brought light to the darkness, He first 
needed to bring into existence the essence of Chaos, the building blocks of Order. From this vast store of potential, the Creator crafted everything we see, hear, andfeel. He molded Order from Chaos, but some of this ever-changing mass was left over — unused.
“And now this remnant seeks to break down all that was created and begin anew, in a never-ending cycle of conception and destruction until perfection is achieved. Or so the creatures of chaos we have been able to capture tells us. Somehow, within the maelstrom sea of pandemonium, intelligence has emerged, slaves to the concept that what the Creator has made is imperfect and impure, requiring it to break us down to our constituent bits. The creatures of Chaos believe we embody stagnation and that we stand in the way of perfection. With creatures that are beholden to such a philosophy there can be no negotiation&hellip; no compromise.
“And so, like all the other Lord Gorum before me, Ifollow the instructions of the Creator and hold this bulwark against the sea of Chaos that assaults us. Now andforever more, we are the Guardians of Order, the Protectors of Life, and should we fail, all will be consumed. ”
Time passed with Telas asking much about this War with Chaos and the form that their agents take. He came to know much of them and additionally learned of another, even greater threat known as Oblivion, but of that Lord Gorum knew but whispers.
Yet as knowledgeable as the monolithic monarch of this realm seemed to be, he knew nothing of mighty Marok or any of the other gods, though he did point the archmage to the Realm of the Burnished Flame, a place where entities similar to Lord Keleos dwelled.
Again, Telas negotiated a similar pact between Lord Gorum and his people and any Marokene elorii that were versed in elemental sorcery. At first Lord Gorum’s request for the nuts and seedlings of trees such as the oak and redwoods puzzled the archmage, until he remembered those thick ropelike roots that wove in and out of the ramparts he first saw. These seedlings were planted deep within the barrier and reinforced it just like the roots of trees keep the earth from washing away. Bidding his host farewell, Telos traveled to the realm that held the greatest promise of finding a sign of the lost deities.
You have invoked the Ancient Pact with Lord Gorum of the Realm of the Solid Sky. In return for gifts of nuts and seedlings from monumental trees, a rare commodity Lord Gorum requires for the 
defense of his realm, he is willing to send you aid. This connection has additionally channeled and influenced your arcane studies into focusing on your elemental bloodline’s connection to the stone.

Boon of the Lord of the Realm of the Solid Sky
Starting at 3<sup>rd</sup> level, Lord Gorum has agreed to allow you to summon warriors from his realm. As an action, you may expend an elder warlock spell slot and sacrifice rare seedlings worth at least 10 gold pieces to summon a Warrior of Jehelka, which appears in an unoccupied space next to you. The Warrior of Jehelka is friendly to you and will disappear when it drops to 0 hit points, after it has served you for one hour, or if you dismiss it as an action. It will also disappear if it is successfully targeted by a casting of dispel magic (or a similar spell or effect) capable of dispelling a spell cast with your elder warlock spell slot.

As part of the action used to summon the Colossus, you must identify the foes you would like destroyed. The Colossus will go on a rampage and not stop until it has completed the task required of it; it will not care what collateral damage it causes along the 
way or if non-combatants or allies are inadvertently wounded in its attacks. Once given a directive, the Colossus cannot be dismissed, recalled, or ordered to cease its attacks.
It will return to its native realm once it has been reduced to 0 hit points, all the identified enemies have been vanquished, or an amount of time has passed equal to 10 minutes per 2000 gold pieces worth of rare seedlings sacrificed, whichever comes first.
Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you complete a long rest.
For complete stats on these creatures see Chapter V: Bestiary.
Earthquake - Lord Gorum&rsquo;s Reluctant Final Boon
Lord Gorum is loath to grant this ritual as its effect is more akin to the devastation wrought by the forces of Chaos that he battles, than the stability and order, which he extols. Nevertheless, if the need is great and the cause just in his eyes, the Lord of the Realm of the Solid Sky will allow the invoker to wield its power. This rite, like the equivalent spells from the other realms, should be used with great care and judiciously as it is capable of causing great loss of life and destruction of property.
One need only look to Fallen Illian, the first city built by the humans after their conquest of blessed Belestor, to see the spell’s capacity to inflict utter ruin upon those within its affected area, for that ill-fated city was swallowed whole by the very earth. The elder sorcerer responsible for the attack was a member of those who would one day call themselves Malfelan, who felt that a natural catastrophe of such a great magnitude would allow his fellow elorii to move unmolested out of the Vastwood. Unfortunately, the human sorcerers had mastered their crude manipulation of the arcane energies and discovered who and what had caused the earthquake. They fell upon those elorii traveling south with a great vengeance and slaughtered thousands of them. The surviving elorii who made it to the shelter of the southern forest called it a victory, for they had slain over fifty thousand humans, but none have ever called upon Lord Gorum’s boon ever since.
You may enact this terrible ritual within 5 miles of your target by spending 15 minutes in uninterrupted incantation and sacrificing your life and your soul. Once payment is made and the final words of intonation are uttered, a massive rumbling can be felt roiling through the earth. The rite may be cast in any geographic location, though side effects such as tidal waves may occur if cast near a coastal region or at sea, while torrents of magma may erupt upward if in a volcanic region.
At first a small rumbling may be felt, followed swiftly by a tremor, which can cause anything not heavy enough or tied down to topple. To those knowledgeable in earth magic, the tremor may give them enough warning to flee the affected area if they are quick enough. Within a few minutes after the tremor, the ground will begin to shake violently, the solid ground appearing to be transformed into an undulating sea. These shockwaves will destroy all but the strongest of constructions, which will suffer some sort of structural damage unless magically protected. The ground will then begin to crack and shatter, possibly swallowing large swaths of land and entombing them underground. Anything touching the ground within 10 miles of the earthquake’s epicenter is destroyed as buildings collapse, fissures open, and the very ground liquefies beneath the feet of the hapless beings unlucky enough to be within range of the dev .IM a ion.
You may only use this feature if you have learned in¬play the secret of speaking the Kurenthe curse. The use of this feature kills you and destroys your essence to fuel its power, and your death in this manner may not be mitigated or undone by anything short of direct, divine intervention. At the gamemaster’s discretion, Lord Gorum may refuse to grant this boon or may ask an additional sacrifice or service before granting it.
The Sheykh of the Realm
of the Burnished Flame (Kelekene)
By Lord Gorum’s leave, his Prime Counsel opened a small breach within their nigh-impenetrable defenses to the Realm of the Burnished Flame. Transitioning through the rift in space, Telos soon found himself in a world that appeared to be in its death throes; huge eruptions of molten rock leapt hundreds of feet into the air and the sky itself was thick with banks of sulfur and soot. Strangely, the elorii archmage felt invigorated and quite at home in the churning inferno.
Looking about, Telos found that he stood on a rocky shore and what appeared to be a paved road was but a few feet from his position. The ambient heat, which strangely felt soothing upon his flesh, made objects in 
the distance waver as if a mirage, but he could make out an immense metropolis rising majestically on the horizon.
As he made his way to the city, he noted strange balls of flame rolling past, whizzing this way and that. After observing them for a while, Telos realized that the fire balls were creatures made of living flame and their strange movements was because of the small, almost invisible metallic insects which they hunted and consumed.
His journey took the elorii past fields littered with shards of sharp obsidian and thick layers of ash from that rose from what appeared to be petrified trees of enormous proportions. As he traveled closer, the city took on a sharper image: a huge wall surrounded buildings that were a mix of neck-bending towers, blocky structures that just peeked over the wall, and 
other buildings topped by minarets.
He later came to understand that the inhabitants of the city, whose name was Milshara, the Burnished City of Brass, were a varied lot. Some had a stony appearance with bright tongues of flame licking out of the various joints, while others were of a more metallic hue, with the same tell-tale licks of flame. After a short amount of time within their midst, Telos came to understand that the indigenous inhabitants of this realm were beings of living flame. The appearances that they affected were to them what clothing was to the beings living upon Arcanis. Unlike clothing, however, the lords of this place dictated what form one could assume, which was predicated upon one’s duties and social standing.
It was not long before the elorii’s presence was brought to the attention of the ruling caste. Living flames encased in elaborate and highly stylized armor accosted him and brought him forth to the Palace of Incandescence, forcing him to kneel before a large throne made of gleaming brass or bronze. Shortly thereafter, a regal being of smoldering, red flesh appeared and sat on the throne, instantly followed by others of his kind.
Telos was informed that he was in the presence of the immortal Sheykh Andalsanna of the Shaitan Empire and was ordered to explain what he was and why he had trespassed upon his city uninvited.
What followed were the most harrowing and enlightening hours of conversation that the archmage had ever experienced. He discovered that these Shaitan lorded over an immense empire that spanned many conquered realms, including the one which he now stood upon. The home realm of the empire was core ward and was a place that hovered near the pure realm where only heat and fire existed.
When asked if the Sheykh had heard of his God,
Keleos, Telos was told such a devastating and terrible story that the archmage was shocked mute for several minutes.
What Telos was told that day, he never related to anyone during his short return to 
Arcanis. Those who saw him said that he looked an empty shell of man, with haunted eyes and a face that looked as if it were incapable of ever smiling again. What the archmage did say was that he had bargained with the Sheykh and he would serve him for one- thousand and one years, as they recorded time in exchange of ensuring that no other elorii would ever be taught the way to travel to the other realms. However, the archmage did not want his own people to be denied the same access to powers that he had acquired for the other elorii and so a final sorcerous pact was made between the Kelekene who had mastered elemental sorcery and the Shaitan of the Realm of the Burnished Flame.
Bidding his people a final farewell, the archmage Telos disappeared one last time and though many have awaited his return, he has never been seen again.
You have invoked the Ancient Pact with the Sheykh of the Realm of the Burnished Flame. In return for gifts of black pearls, a rare commodity in his realm, he is willing to send you aid. This connection has additionally channeled and influenced your arcane studies into focusing on your elemental bloodline’s connection to fire.

Starting at 1<sup>st</sup> level, you learn the elemental blast cantrip, which does not count against your total elder warlock cantrips known. It deals fire damage.
Boon of the Sheykh of the Realm of the Burnished Flame
Starting at 3<sup>rd</sup> level, the Sheykh of the Realm of the Burnished Flame has agreed to allow you to summon warriors from his realm. As an action, you may expend 
an elder warlock spell slot and sacrifice black pearls worth at least 10 gold pieces to summon a Blazing Archer of Milshara, which appears in an unoccupied space next to you. The Blazing Archer of Milshara is friendly to you and will disappear when it drops to 0 hit points, after it has served you for one hour, or if you dismiss it as an action. It will also disappear if it is successfully targeted by a casting of dispel magic (or a similar spell or effect) capable of dispelling a spell cast with your elder warlock spell slot. Until the Blazing Archer of Milshara disappears, you cannot maintain concentration on any spell that conjures or summons a creature or creatures. The Blazing Archer of Milshara will obey your verbal commands, requiring no action, so long as you share a language with it. If you issue no commands, then the Blazing Archer of Milshara will attack any creature it sees, which is obviously hostile to you. Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you complete long rest. The action used to activate this feature may be interrupted by counterspell as if it were a spell cast with your elder warlock spell slot, in which case the elder warlock spell slot is still expended but the black pearls are not sacrificed, and this feature is not considered to have been used.
Starting at 6<sup>th</sup> level, you may instead use this feature to summon a Molten Tiger. If you do so, then the sacrificed black pearls must be worth at least 75 gold pieces.
Starting at 14<sup>th</sup> level, you may instead use this feature to summon a Pyromancer from the Realm of the Burnished Flame. If you do so, then the sacrificed black pearls must be worth at least 200 gold pieces.
Fortitude of the Burnished Flame
Starting at 6<sup>th</sup> level, your connection to the realm of the Burnished Flame has fortified you against that which is anathema to your elemental nature and the nature of the Sheykh’s realm. You gain resistance to cold damage.
Blessing of the Burnished Flame
Starting at 10<sup>th</sup> level, your connection to the realm of the Burnished Flame has enhanced your natural resistance to acid to fortify you against the nature of the Sheykh’s realm. You gain immunity to fire damage.
Improved Pact Ritual
Starting at 14<sup>th</sup> level, you may expend an elder warlock spell slot to use the Boon of the Sheykh of the Realm of the Burnished Flame feature a second time before completing a long rest.</p>
<p>The Sheykh&rsquo;s Ancient Friend
Starting at 20<sup>th</sup> level, the Sheykh has favored you by allowing the summoning of his friend, Exurapas the Flaming Phoenix, believed by many denizens of the fire aligned Inner Realms to be the creator of all.
So long as you are adjacent to a space large enough to contain it, as an action you may sacrifice black pearls worth at least 2000 gold pieces to summon Exurapas, who appears in a space adjacent to you.
Care must be taken when calling upon Exurapas as it is a nigh-uncontrollable force of destruction. Once it appears, Exurapas will attack all living things in the immediate area, excluding only you. As an action, you may attempt a DC 25 Charisma (Persuasion) check to convince Exurapas to spare your allies.
It will return to its native realm once it is reduced to 0 hit points, an amount of time has passed equal to 10 minutes per 2000 gold pieces worth of black pearls sacrificed, it has extinguished the lives of all detectable living creatures aside from those it has been convinced to spare, or you use an action to send it home.
Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you complete a long rest.

Storm of Fire -
the Sheykh&rsquo;s Final Boon
Of all the Lords of the Inner Realms encountered by Telos, only the Sheykh is happy to grant a final boon such as this. The reason is that while the boon granted is a devastating rain of fire, it is accomplished by sending thousands of lesser elementals to the elder warlock’s realm and allowing them free reign in spreading destruction throughout that land. In essence, each time the Storm of Fire ritual is enacted, it acts as a small invasion by the Realm of the Burnished Sky, to what end, only the Sheykh knows.
It is said that fire is a living thing, running rampant, consuming all that is in its path, breathing and growing until finally dying out. It is for this reason that pyromancers, more than any other elemental sorcerers, must take utmost care and exert unrivaled control over their flames, for once the fire has been summoned, unlike earth, air, or water, it will strain to be free, struggling to consume and grow without restraint.
To date, there has never been a need so great that a Kelekene has seen the need to call down this torrent of flame. Even the Malfelan, long known to take extreme 
action against their foes, have not resorted to this measure.
You may enact this terrible ritual within five miles of your target by spending 15 minutes in uninterrupted incantation and sacrificing your life and your soul. Once payment is made and the final words of intonation are uttered, your sacrifice causes an unnatural storm to begin to form above a targeted region covering 10 square miles. Shattering thunder and weirdly greenish bolts of lightning presage the coming of the storm, but unlike those that Lord Hurrian commands, this storm unleashes sheets of fire. The flames ignite any flammable material in the initial area, incinerating wooden structures in minutes. The air grows so hot that it causes any mortal breathing it to literally burn from the inside out. Anyone in the immediate area caught outside of shelter will be incinerated. Stone buildings will afford some small measure of protection, but eventually the heat will increase to the point that the very walls will glow and anyone trapped inside will be cooked alive as if they were within an oven. The storm of fire will initially destroy everything in a ten-mile radius. The fire ignited by the ritual will continue to burn wildly for so long as there is fuel for it to consume. The one thing in the defenders’ favor is that the flames summoned by the spell are ultimately of a mundane nature and can be extinguished by normal means: water, fire lines, lack of oxygen, etc. This may be a small consolation as the raging inferno covers such a large area that those seeking to put it out may have no recourse but to let the fires burn themselves out.
You may only use this feature if you have learned in¬play the secret of speaking the Kurenthe curse. The use of this feature kills you and destroys your essence to fuel its power, and your death in this manner may not be mitigated or undone by anything short of direct, divine intervention. At the gamemaster’s discretion, the Sheykh may refuse to grant this boon or may ask an additional sacrifice or service before granting it.
The Plant Lords (Ardakene)
Hearing of the woeful tale of the archmage Telos, Mendros, a Life Warden of great power and knowledge, saw the benefit of forging such sorcerous pacts with other great powers, but also saw the folly of trucking with beings not of this world. Though forbidden by his elders, the young Life Warden decided that the benefits to his people far outweighed the dangers he would face or the censure that might be 
voices rung out, “We have decided that you speak from the heart and true. Regrettably, we cannot help you as we do not know where the Mother hides herself though we know that she still lives and is within our realm. ”
“Who are you that you would know this?” Mendros asked.
A rumbling ensued that the Life Warden was startled to realize was their form of laughter. “We are Her first. This sacred place was where the Mother, Belisarda, awakened. So full of joy, She shared the gift of sentience with those about Her and so awakened us and gave us the ability to realize that we ‘were’. Over time, our roots have grown strong and connected with others of our kind that have not awakened, but nonetheless are aware of what is about them. From that web of life, we know that She still lives somewhere among us, but hides Herself As great and vast as our power is, Hers is greater. We cannot find Her. ” Mendros stayed among these Plant Lords, as he came to call them, for they had no need of names amongst themselves, and lived for a long while upon this island continent that had birthed the Life Mother. While beautiful with all sorts of plants and flowers that were unknown or extinct elsewhere upon Arcanis, this land was also fraught with danger as nature had run amok here, creating some of the most exotic and dangerous creatures he had ever encountered.
After a lifetime of learning and communing with these primordial beings, Mendros decided to take his leave and return to Elonbe. Before he left, he made arrangements whereby other Ardakene may call upon them. Pacts were made and sworn on that day. As part of the agreement, Mendros was tasked with taking small saplings, progeny of the Plant Lords, and planting them on the soil of the different continents. The last two he planted within the sacred grove in Elonbe.
You have invoked the Ancient Pact with the Plant Lords. In return for gifts of fervidite, a rare commodity, the Plant Lords require for unknown reasons, they are willing to send you aid. This connection has additionally channeled and influenced your arcane studies into focusing on your elemental bloodline’s connection to life and nature. </p>
<p>Expanded Spell List
The Plant Lords let you choose from an expanded list of spells when you learn an elder warlock spell. The following spells are added to the elder warlock spell list for you. Spells marked with f are found in the Arcanis 5e Campaign Setting and spells marked with a * are new spells found later in the Chapter IV:
Elder Magic of Arcanis.
Calling Upon the Green
Starting at 1<sup>st</sup> level, your bond to the Plant Lords allows you to summon creatures made from the essence of life and nature. Any time you cast a spell or use an ability that allows you to conjure or summon a creature of the elemental type, you may instead conjure or summon a creature of the Plant type with a challenge rating equal to or lower than the challenge rating of the elemental normally conjured or summoned by the spell or ability. For example, you may conjure a shambling mound by casting conjure elemental.
Additionally, starting at 1<sup>st</sup> level, you learn find familiar as an additional elder warlock spell known, which does not count against your total elder warlock spells known. Any</p>
<p>time you summon a familiar, its type changes to Plant regardless of its form. Your familiar gains the following traits:
•   Regardless of the form taken its coloration is always deep green with emerald green eyes.
•   Its coloration grants it advantage on all Dexterity (Stealth) checks when within natural foliage of the same color.
Elemental blast
Starting at 1<sup>st</sup> level, you learn the elemental blast cantrip, which does not count against your total elder warlock cantrips known. It deals your choice of slashing or radiant damage, chosen at the time of casting. The beams of energy are made of a 
combination of spectral vines and pure life energy. Additionally, anytime you would drop a creature’s hit point total to 0 with elemental blast, you may choose to have them automatically succeed at their death saving throw, stabilizing at 0 hit points, even if the damage done would normally kill them.
Boon of the Plant Lords
Starting at 3<sup>rd</sup> level, the Plant Lords have agreed to send protectors to watch over you when needed. As an action, you may expend an elder warlock spell slot and sacrifice fervidite worth at least 10 gold pieces to summon a Protector of the Green, which appears in an unoccupied space next to you.
The Protector of the Green is friendly to you and will disappear when it drops to 0 hit points, after it has served you for one hour, or if you dismiss it as an action. It will also disappear if it is successfully targeted by a casting of dispel magic (or a similar spell or effect) capable of dispelling a spell cast with your elder warlock spell slot. Until the Protector of the Green disappears, you cannot maintain concentration on any spell that conjures or summons a creature or creatures.
The Protector of the Green will obey your verbal commands, requiring no action, so long as you share a language with it. If you issue no commands, then the Protector of the Green will attack any creature it sees that is obviously hostile to you.
The action used to activate this feature may be interrupted by counterspell as if it were a spell cast with your elder warlock spell slot, in which case the elder warlock spell slot is still expended but the fervidite is not sacrificed and this feature is not considered to have been used.
Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you complete long rest.
Starting at 6<sup>th</sup> level, you may instead use this feature to summon a Champion of the Heartwood. If you do so, then the sacrificed fervidite must be worth at least 75 gold pieces.
Starting at 14<sup>th</sup> level, you may instead use this feature to summon an Arbormancer of the Plant Lords. If you do so, then the sacrificed fervidite must be worth at least 200 gold pieces.
Fortitude of the Plant Lords
Starting at 6<sup>th</sup> level, your connection to the pure life web of the Plant Lords has fortified your life energy. You gain advantage on death saving throws, and you gain resistance to radiant damage.</p>
<p>Blessing of the Plant Lords
Starting at 10<sup>th</sup> level, your connection to the pure life web of the Plant Lords has further enhanced your life energy. You gain resistance to necrotic damage. If you are already resistant to necrotic damage or later become so from another source, then you instead become immune to necrotic damage.
Improved Pact Ritual
Starting at 14<sup>th</sup> level, you may expend an elder warlock spell slot to use the Boon of the Plant Lords feature a second time before completing a long rest.
Belisarda&rsquo;s First Children
Starting at 20<sup>th</sup> level, one of the greatest of the Plant Lords will personally heed your call to aid. Kratae, the Great Hawthorne, once a sapling offshoot of the first tree that sprang to life under Belisarda’s love, is tasked to come to the aid of those who call through the life web. So long as you are adjacent to a space of bare earth or unworked stone large enough to contain it, as an action you may sacrifice fervidite worth at least 2000 gold pieces to summon Kratae, who appears in a space adjacent to you.
Kratae is friendly to you and your allies, and it will generally follow any requests you make. It is a proud and ancient being, however, and will refuse to follow any direct orders or commands given to it. Kratae will also automatically seek to heal any living creature that is making death saving throws. Kratae will become hostile to anyone, including you and your allies, who kills any living thing within its sight. If someone successfully kills a living creature, then Kratae will make every attempt to knock that person unconscious and return to the Realm of the Plant Lords with the offender, keeping them imprisoned until they complete enough acts of penitence to appease Kratae.
Kratae will return to its native realm once it is reduced to 0 hit points, an amount of time has passed equal to 10 minutes per 2000 gold pieces worth of fervidite sacrificed, or you use an action to send it home. You cannot use an action to send Kratae home if he is hostile to you or one of your allies.
Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you complete a long rest.

The Green - the Plant Lords&rsquo; Reluctant Final Boon
Though reluctant to grant the following boon, the Plant Lords can be convinced that the unleashing of destructive forces is justified against those who threaten the balance of life itself. All things return to earth from whence it came. All living things follow this immutable law and even those things made from nonliving material must bow to the inevitable. The landscape of Arcanis is strewn with the bleached bones of fallen empires, crumbled kingdoms, and the ashes of monuments, though it can take many years, centuries, or even millennia for nature to reclaim what was once hers.
This ritual accelerates the natural processes, calling upon the vibrant force of life to breakdown and reabsorbs anything and everything in its path.
The Green is nature run amok; inexorable and undiscriminating of anything within its reach.
Plant shoots erupt through feet of concrete or wood, constricting and crushing whatever is within its tendrils. Any living materials, from animals to sentient beings, are violently absorbed into the green mass; drowning them in a sea of foliage. The tallest of towers will be toppled, the thickest walls rent, and whatever blemish was made upon the earth shall be expunged, leaving behind a virgin landscape of a primordial forest.
You may enact this terrible ritual within five miles of your target by spending 15 minutes in uninterrupted incantation and sacrificing your life and your soul.
Once payment is made and the final words of intonation are uttered, a large, primordial forest quickly grows in the area. Seemingly ancient plants sprout from the earth in a matter of moments, transforming the area into a lush, verdant paradise. All buildings and man-made structures in the area are slowly, but relentlessly destroyed as they are torn apart by massive roots, vines, and limbs. Even living creatures in the area are not spared as they choke on pollen or are strangled by fast-moving vines. Others affected by the ritual itself are absorbed into the Green, their</p>

<p>Arcane magic taps into the residual energy of Creation to achieve miraculous and often mind-bending effects. This gives these ancient practitioners mastery over such exotic effects as creating an object out of thin air, changing the very essence of one thing to another, or tapping directly into the raw building blocks of reality (such as the Elemental Planes).</p>
<p>The Eldritch Tradition is the magic used by most of the younger races of Arcanis, such as humanity and ss’ressen. Like the Elder Tradition, eldritch sorcerers funnel the residual power of Creation through themselves, channeling it to perform a desired effect through sheer force of will.</p>
<p>To illuminate the differences, masters of the Eldritch Tradition explain to their students that elder sorcerers are able to form and maintain a long equation, manipulate it, and even complete it, all without the help of paper and stylus. An eldritch 
sorcerer can formulate the equation in their mind, manipulate it to a point, but then has to estimate the answer. If Elder 
sorcery is a scalpel, then the Eldritch Tradition is a sledgehammer. </p>

<h3 id="potent-casting">Potent Casting<a class="headerlink" href="#potent-casting" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>Starting at 10<sup>th</sup> level, you add your Charisma modifier to one damage roll of any spell and cantrip you cast.</p>

<p>Starting at 18<sup>th</sup> level, you can rapidly draw on the arcane power around you, channeling it into a spell with 
devastating effect. </p>
<p>As a bonus action, you can absorb ambient magical energy in order to heighten the power of a spell. You must 
make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a successful save, the next spell you cast before the end of your turn 
is cast at a spell level equal to it’s minimum level + 4 (maximum 9<sup>th</sup> level). You must still expend a spell slot of 
the spell’s minimum level. If you expend a higher level spell slot, you receive no additional benefits. </p>
<p>For example, if you use this feature to cast scorching ray you would cast it as if it were a 6<sup>th</sup> level spell (2<sup>nd</sup> level 
minimum +4). You must still expend a 2<sup>nd</sup> level spell slot to cast this spell, but you get the benefits of it being cast as if you used a 6<sup>th</sup> level spell slot. If you fail the Constitution saving throw, the magical energy you are attempting to channel erupts from you. All 
creatures, including yourself, in a 10-foot radius around you must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. Affected creatures suffer 5d6 force damage, or half as much on a successful save.</p>
<p>Regardless of whether your succeeded or failed on the Constitution saving throw, the area around you is depleted of magical energy when you use Eldritch Rending. For 4 hours, a 50-foot radius zone centered on where you were when you used Eldritch Rending is nearly devoid of the power of Creation. </p>
<p>Any creature that targets a creature or object in this zone with a spell has disadvantage on their spell attack roll. Creatures in this zone have advantage on any saving throws against spells.
Any creature within this zone that targets a creature or object outside the zone with a spell has disadvantage on their spell attack roll. Any creature affected by a spell cast from within this zone has advantage on any saving throws to resist the spell’s effects, if any. 
At the end of the turn in which you use this feature, you gain 1 level of exhaustion which may only be removed by resting. You cannot use this feature while you are exhausted. </p>

<p>During its early expansion, the Coryani Empire found that 
it’s most devastating auxilia were those comprised of War 
Mages. Exceedingly rare, these men and women were able 
to tap into the most destructive mystic arts while at the </p>
<p>same time close with the enemy and be just as deadly with 
a gladius.
Over time, other militaries saw the wisdom in fielding 
such highly skilled and versatile soldiers; their only 
drawback being the difficulty in finding those with the 
temperament to serve as a War Mage.</p>

<p>When you cast a spell, you can siphon and reshape some  of its arcane power, channeling into your allies. You may 
choose one of the following Metamagic options, learning an additional option at 4<sup>th</sup> level and 6<sup>th</sup> level. You can use 
a Metamagic option you gain from this feature even if you have already used a different Metamagic option during the 
casting of a spell.</p>
<p>• Enhance Arms Spell: When you cast a spell, you can spend 2 arcane points to temporarily enchant any weapons held by friendly creatures you can see within 20 feet of you. For 1 minute, those weapons are considered magical for the purposes of bypassing immunities and resistances. 
• Fortifying Spell: When you cast a spell, you can spend 1 arcane point to grant 5 + your Charisma modifier temporary hit points to a friendly creature you can see within 10 feet. These temporary hit points remain for 1 hour. 
• Inspiring Spell: When you cast a spell, you can spend 1 arcane point to grant a friendly creature you can see within 10 feet immunity to fear for 1 minute. </p>
