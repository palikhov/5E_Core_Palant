Дистанция: 10 футов
Компоненты: В, С, М (стоящие 10 зм уголь, благовония и травы, сжигаемые в огне или латунной жаровне)
Длительность: Мгновенная</p>
<p>Вы получаете в услужение фамильяра — духа, принимающего облик выбранного вами животного: ворона, кошки, краба, крысы, летучей мыши, лягушки (жабы), морского конька, осьминога, паука, рыбы (пиранья), совы, хорька, ядовитой змеи, ястреба или ящерицы. Появившись в свободном пространстве в пределах дистанции, фамильяр приобретает характеристики выбранной формы, хотя он не зверь, а небожитель, фея или исчадие (на ваш выбор).
Ваш фамильяр действует независимо от вас, но всегда повинуется вашим командам. В сражении оно определяет свою инициативу и действует в свой ход. Фамильяр не может атаковать, но может совершать другие действия как обычно.
Когда хиты фамильяра опускаются до 0, он исчезает, не оставляя физического тела. Он возвращается, когда вы используете это заклинание ещё раз.
Пока фамильяр находится в пределах 100 футов, вы можете общаться с ним телепатически. Кроме того, вы можете действием начать смотреть глазами фамильяра и слушать его ушами до начала своего следующего хода, получая преимущество от особых чувств, которыми может обладать фамильяр. В это время для своих собственных чувств вы слепы и глухи.
Вы можете действием временно отпустить своего фамильяра. Тот исчезает в карманном измерении, где будет ждать, пока вы его не призовёте. В качестве альтернативы, вы можете отпустить его насовсем. Пока фамильяр временно отпущен, вы можете действием вернуть его в свободное пространство в пределах 30 футов от себя.
У вас не может быть больше одного фамильяра одновременно. Если вы накладываете это заклинание, уже имея фамильяра, вы заставляете принять его новый облик. Выберите один из описанных выше обликов. Ваш фамильяр становится этим существом.
Если вы накладываете заклинание с дистанцией «касание», его может передать фамильяр, как если бы это он его накладывал. Ваш фамильяр должен при этом находиться в пределах 100 футов от вас, и он использует свою реакцию, когда вы накладываете его. Если заклинание требует броска атаки, вы используете свой модификатор атаки.</p>
<h4 id="find-familiar">Find Familiar<a class="headerlink" href="#find-familiar" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>В заклинание внесены следующие изменения:
1.     Длительность призыва: 10 часов, при этом ритуал должен начинаться на рассвете.
2.    Вы определяете одну форму в которой воплотится фамильяр – этот фамильяр не сможет принимать любую другую форму (если конечно его форма на это не способна самостоятельно).
3.    Если вы захотите сменить фамильяра, то после разрыва связи с первым – второго вы сможете призвать через 10 дней.
4.    Фамильяр развивается вместе с вашим даром заклинателя:
- фамильяр получает +1 хп за каждый уровень заклинателя
-  начальное значение Интеллекта фамильяра – 6 или значение Интеллекта выбраннй формы, если оно выше
- Интеллект фамильяра развивается с уровнем заклинателя –  Интеллект фамильяра равен 6+(уровень заклинателя-2)/2 (округляется в меньшую сторону, но не меньше 0).
- Начиная с 6 уровня заклинателя фамильяр получает возможность полноценно разговаривать телепатически с заклинателем), а с 11 уровня заклинателя – просто получает дар речи
5. В случае если призванный фамильяр погибает, а заклинатель еще жив то заклинатель получает урон в размере Уровень к4 (т.е. на 5ом уровне заклинателя – 5к4). Фамильяр может быть возвращен к жизни повторным ритуалом призыва заклинателем с полным количеством хитов</p>

<p>Whenever a spellcaster attempts to cast the identify spell, you can use these rules as an alternative. These rules try to solve the problem with how the spell might reveal any mystery that could have been. Instead, it works with a set DC for how well the attempt is. This reinforces that more powerful spellcasters can properly identify the properties of an artifact, whereas a new wizard or sorcerer would not be able to.
Whenever the identify spell is cast, the caster must make an ability check using their spellcasting ability. The DC can be found below on the Identify Item table. On a success, the creature learns the properties of the magic item. On a failure, the creature cannot cast identify on the item for the next 24 hours.

<p>A tellsong is an alarm spell, triggered under specific conditions (like those governing a magic mouth), that is invisible, and its &ldquo;alarm&rdquo; is a chiming tune, audible only to the caster (unless the caster desires otherwise and sets it so during casting), that sounds whenever the caster comes within range. It either chimes one way, to signal its continued presence and active status, or another way, to tell the caster whatever it was set to detect has happened. If touched by detection magic or by any powerful unleashed magical effect, the tellsong is instantly and tracelessly destroyed (i.e. the person detecting magic wouldn&rsquo;t detect it, because their attempt to detect it would destroy it).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Meaning, in this particular case, the Lord Warder knows that someone or something destroyed this tellsong of his, without &ldquo;setting it off.&rdquo; Which in turn usually means a spellcaster of some skills, who was alert for traps or alarms, has been in a tellsong-guarded area. The name of the spell came from its earliest form, devised long ago, when Myth Drannan casters (usually elves, but this was the <a class="wikilink" href="/first/">first</a>time of the City of Song open to all races) sang something or magically &ldquo;recorded&rdquo; someone else singing something, and used it as the audible alarm part of the spell.</p>

<p>Вы вызываете дух, принимающий облик невероятно умного, сильного и верного скакуна, создавая долгосрочную связь с ним. Появляясь в свободном пространстве в пределах дистанции, скакун принимает выбранный вами облик, такой как боевой конь, пони, верблюд, лось или мастифф (Мастер может позволить призывать в качестве скакунов других животных). Скакун приобретает характеристики выбранной формы, хотя на самом деле он является небожителем, феей или исчадием (на ваш выбор). Кроме того, если у вашего скакуна Интеллект 5 или меньше, его Интеллект становится равен 6, и он получает способность понимать один язык на ваш выбор, на котором вы разговариваете.
Ваш скакун служит вам как в бою, так и вне его, и у вас с ним есть инстинктивная связь, позволяющая сражаться как единое целое. Находясь верхом на скакуне, вы можете делать так, что наложенные вами заклинания, нацеливающиеся только на вас, будут нацелены ещё и на скакуна.
Когда хиты скакуна опускаются до 0, он исчезает, не оставляя физического тела. Вы можете также в любое время отпустить скакуна действием, заставляя его исчезнуть. В любом случае, повторное использование этого заклинания призывает этого же скакуна, восстанавливая хиты до максимума.
Пока скакун находится в пределах 1 мили от вас, вы можете общаться с ним телепатически.
У вас не может быть больше одного скакуна, призванного этим заклинанием, одновременно. Вы можете действием навсегда отпустить скакуна, освободив его от уз и заставляя исчезнуть.
В случае смерти скакуна, вы не можете призвать его (или любого другого скакуна) в течении 10 дней.</p>

<p>Tapping into the subconscious mind of a willing creature, you call upon the seductive powers of your goddess to create a phantasmal image of what the target finds most alluring. Only the target can see the image.
The image hovers over the target, writhing enticingly and whispering promises of physical fulfillment. The target is unconscious until the spell ends, at which point a surge of euphoria goes through the creature, causing it to regain 70 hit points. This surge of euphoria also ends blindness, deafness and any diseases affecting the creature. This spell has no effect on constructs, oozes, plants, or undead. </p>

<h3 id="enchant-an-item">Enchant an Item<a class="headerlink" href="#enchant-an-item" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>4<sup>th</sup>-level Enchantment (Invocation)</p>
<p>Casting Time: Special</p>
<p>Range: Touch</p>
<p>Components: V, S, M (components for enchanting costs min 200 gp)</p>
<p>Duration: Special</p>
<p>This is a spell that must be used by a wizard planning to create a magical item. The enchant an item spell prepares the object to accept the magic. The item must meet the following tests:</p>
<p>it must be in sound and undamaged condition;</p>
<p>the item must be the finest possible, considering its nature, i.e., crafted of the highest quality material and with the finest workmanship; its cost or value must reflect the second test, and in most cases the item must have a raw-materials cost in excess of 200 gp.</p>
<p>It is not possible to apply this test to items such as ropes, leather goods, cloth, and pottery not normally embroidered, bejeweled, tooled, carved, or engraved. If such work or materials can be added to an item without weakening or harming its normal func¬tions, however, these are required for the item to be enchanted.</p>
<p>The wizard must have access to a workshop or laboratory, properly equipped and from which contaminating magic can be screened. Any magical item not related to the fabrication process (such as most protective devices) and within 30 feet of the materials is a source of contaminating magic and will spoil the process.</p>
<p>The item to be prepared must be touched by the spellcaster. This touching must be constant and continual during the casting time, which is a base 16 hours plus an additional 1d8 hours per level of spell which will be casted after Enchant an Item(as the wizard may never work more than eight hours per day, and any other spells will not alter the time required in any way, this effectively means that casting time for this spell is two days + level of desired spell days). All work must be uninterrupted, and during rest periods the item being enchanted must never be more than 1 foot distant from the spellcaster; if it is, the whole spell is spoiled and must be begun again. (Note that during rest periods absolutely no other form of magic can be performed, and the wizard must remain quiet and in isolation or the enchantment is ruined.)</p>
<p>Each spell subsequently cast upon an object bearing an enchant an item spell requires 2d4 hours per spell level of the magic being cast. Again, during casting the item must be touched by the wizard, and during the rest periods it must always be within 1 foot of his person. This procedure holds true for any additional spells placed upon the item, and each successive spell must be begun within 24 hours of the last, even if the prior spell failed.</p>
<p>No magic placed on an item is permanent unless a Permanency spell is used as a finishing touch. This always runs a 5% risk of draining 1 point of Constitution from the wizard casting the spell which can’t be restored by any means but Wish. Also, while it is possible to tell when the basic spell (enchant an item) succeeds, it is not possible to tell if successive castings actually work, for each must make the same sort of Intelligence check. Naturally, an item that is charged-a rod, staff, wand, javelin of lightning, ring of wishes, etc — can never be made permanent — only rechargable. Magical devices cannot be used to enchant an item or cast magic upon an object so prepared, but scrolls can be used for this purpose.</p>
<p>The materials needed for this spell vary according to both the nature of the item being enchanted and the magic to be cast upon it. For example, a cloak of displacement might require the hides of one or more displacer beasts, a sword meant to slay dragons could require the blood and some other part of the dragon(s) it will be effective against, and a ring of shooting stars might require pieces of meteorites and the horn of ki-rin. These specifics, as well as other information pertaining to this spell, are decided by the DM and must be discovered or researched in play.</p>

<p>Area of Effect:One item or a volume of liquid or raw materials</p>
<p>no greater than the caster&rsquo;s body volume Saving Throw:None</p>
<p>This spell destroys any curses, magical tracers linked to other spells or magics, and remnants of previous magics from a single nonliving item (which may be composed of any number of materi¬als) or a single body of liquid (in puddle form or filling a con¬tainer). The spell causes its target material to glow to indicate the presence of active or not-yet-unleashed magics in the item or sub-stances the spell is applied to, but it does not trigger, alter, or iden¬tify such dweomers. Obar&rsquo;s lesser purification affects dry or powdered materials of the same volume as a liquid if they are gathered into a heap or continuous volume (for example, filling a cup or coffer), but does not affect recently living materials, such as the bodies of beings who have been dead for less than a month or who are now undead. Obar&rsquo;s lesser purification also serves to purge liquids —such as those used in the making of potions or magic-related unguents, baths, or tinctures —of impurities, either natural or magical in origin. It performs this secondary function simultaneously with its major dweomer-related purging.</p>
<p>The material components are a pinch of limestone dust, a pinch of salt, and three drops from a potion of sweet water.</p>

Range: 30 feet 
Components: V, S, M (A gemstone worth 50 gp that the spell consumes)
Duration: Concentration, up to 24 hours</p>
<p>This spell reanimates a construct that has been reduced to 0 hit points. The target must be within range and visible and it must be relatively intact. It can be missing limbs or a head, but it must still be possible for the target to move under its own power.
This spell cannot reanimate disintegrated constructs, iron golems destroyed by rust, or constructs reduced to a limbless torso. If the construct is destroyed a second time, further attempts at reanimation are hopeless.
The target construct is recreated and placed under your control as if you had created it. It retains only half of its maximum hit points while all its damage immunities become resistances instead. It also loses both the berserk and magic resistance abilities. If you cast this spell on a shield guardian or any other construct that utilizes a control amulet or similar device, you are considered to be in possession of this device for the spells duration.
On each of your turns, you can use a bonus action to mentally command any construct you reanimated with this spell if the creature is within 60 feet of you (if you control multiple creatures, you can command any or all of them at the same time, issuing the same command to each one). You decide what action the creature will take and where it will move during its next turn, or you can issue a general command, such as to guard a chamber or corridor. If you do not issue any commands, the creature will only defend itself against hostile creatures. Once given an order, the creature continues to follow it until its task is complete.
The target construct is under your control for 24 hours, after which it stops obeying any command you&rsquo;ve given it. To maintain control of the creature for another 24 hours, you must cast this spell on the creature again before the current 24-hour period ends. This use of the spell reasserts your control on one construct you have reanimated with this spell, rather than reanimating a new one.</p>

Area of Effect: 1 clear or translucent gemstone of crystalline structure no larger in size than the caster&rsquo;s balled fist Saving Throw:Special This spell transforms the internal structure of a clear or translucent gemstone of crystalline structure no larger in size than the caster&rsquo;s balled fist to enable it to receive and hold a spell dweomer (usually cast into it by use of a dweomerflow spell). At the time the spell is cast, roll an item saving throw for the gem¬stone vs. magical fire (rock, crystal vs. magical fire). Success means that the spell is successful; failure destroys the gemstone. Gemstones of above-normal quality may receive a bonus to the saving throw at the DM&rsquo;s discretion (usually from +1 to up to +3 for flawless or otherwise extremely exceptional quality stones). The gemstone glows with a soft internal radiance once focal stone is cast (which in some markets raises its value), and it emits a faint dweomer. If immersed in a poisonous liquid, the focal stone turns a vivid purple and can be commanded by touch and will to neutralize poison. If so commanded, the focal stone dissolves and is destroyed, but it leaves the liquid safe to drink or touch. A focal stone otherwise has no special properties; contrary to popular belief, it cannot reach out and trap spells cast near it or suck in passing enchanted creatures, though it is an ideal recepta-  cle for the life force of a being using a magic jar spell. The focal stone spell does not prevent the focal stone from being shattered by deliberate attack (a crushing blow, for instance), but does pre¬vent it from being damaged by natural and magical heat, flame, lava, extreme cold, or mineral contamination. Shattering a focal stone immediately unleashes the full effects of any spell stored in it in a manner determined by the DM. A dispel magic cast on such a stone does not affect it or any stored magics. The material component is a pinch of any sort of opal dust.</p>

<li>Comprehend languages</li>
<li>Alter Self</li>
<li>Darkvision</li>

The wizard casts the desired spell and then follows it with the Permanency spell. Each Permanency spell lowers the wizard’s Constitution by 1 point for duration of Permanency spell. The wizard cannot cast these spells upon other creatures. This application of Permanency can be dispelled only by a wizard of greater level than the spellcaster was when he cast the spell.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to personal use, the Permanency (also with lowering of wizard’s Constitution) spell can be used to make the following object/creature or area-effect spells permanent:</p>
<ul>
<li>Web</li>
<li>Enlarge/Reduce</li>
<li>Invisibility (Note that any action that break Invisibility will also break Permanency)</li>
<li>Fear</li>

<li>Stinking cloud</li>
<li>Wall of fire</li>
<li>Wall of force</li>
<li>Tiny Servant (if tiny servant will be destroyed Permanency will end)</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, the following spells can be cast upon objects or areas only and rendered permanent (without lowering of caster’s Constitution):</p>
<ul>
<li>Dancing lights</li>
<li>Alarm</li>
<li>Illusory Script</li>
<li>Fog Cloud</li>
<li>Grease</li>
<li>Snare (only affecting duration of Snare before triggering — after triggering Permanency will end)</li>
<li>Magic Circle</li>
<li>Scrying (only if Scrying is targeting location and not creature)</li>
<li>Teleportation Circle</li>
<li>Programmed Illusion</li>
<li>These applications to other spells allow it to be cast simultaneously with any of the latter when no living creature is the target, but the entire spell complex then can be dispelled normally, and thus negated.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Permanency spell is also used in the fabrication of magical items (see the 4<sup>th</sup>-level spell Enchant an Item). At the DM’s option, Permanency might become unstable or fail after a long period of at least 1000 years. Unstable effects might operate intermittently or fail altogeth</p>

<p>Casting Time: 2 hours
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M (incense, gold dust and powdered granite worth at least 400 gp, which the spell consumes)
Duration: Until dispelled or triggered</p>
<p>When you cast this spell, you inscribe a rune either upon a surface (such as a table or a section of floor or wall) or within an object that can be closed (such as a book, a scroll, or a treasure chest) to conceal the rune. If you choose a surface, the rune can cover an area of the surface no larger than 20 feet in diameter. If you choose an object, that object must remain in its place; if the object is moved more than 10 feet from where you cast this spell, the rune is broken, and the spell ends without being triggered.
The rune is nearly invisible and requires a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC to be found.
You decide what triggers the rune when you cast the spell. For runes inscribed on a surface, the most typical triggers include touching or standing on the rune, removing another object covering the rune, approaching within a certain distance of the rune, or manipulating the object on which the rune is inscribed. For runes inscribed within an object, the most common triggers include opening the object, approaching within a certain distance of the object, or seeing or reading the rune. Once a rune is triggered, this spell ends.
You can further refine the trigger so the spell activates only under certain circumstances or according to physical characteristics (such as height or weight), creature kind (for example, the ward could be set to affect undead or orcs), or alignment. You can also set conditions for creatures that don&rsquo;t trigger the rune, such as those who say a certain password.
Most runes duplicate or resemble the effects of certain wizard spells and unless specified, any target must make a save against your spell save DC t determine how and if they are affected. These runes are:
<strong>Alhalbrin.</strong> This rune acts as a sunburst spell and any creature or creatures activating it in a 60 foot radius centered on the rune must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 8d6 radiant damage and is blinded for 1 minute. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage and isn&rsquo;t blinded by the rune. Undead and oozes have disadvantage on this saving throw.
<strong>Dhelearak.</strong> This rune acts as a disintegrate spell on creatures activating it. Unlike the wizard spell of the same name, more than one living creature may be affected by the rune.
<strong>Faerindyl.</strong> This rune acts as a flaming sphere spell doing 6d6 fire damage of a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The sphere will move to contact the triggering creature or any triggering creature (if more than one the DM can choose or determine randomly) and can move up to 30 feet in any turn for up to 1 minute. If there are no triggering creatures within 30 feet of the sphere it does not move that turn.
<strong>Kharramsyr.</strong> This rune acts as a flesh to stone spell on creatures activating it. Unlike the wizard spell of the same name, more than one living creature may be affected by the rune.
Sabras. This rune acts as a circle of death spell doing 8d6 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one on any creature or creatures activating it in a 60 foot radius centered on the rune.
<strong>Saerindyl.</strong> This rune acts as a chain lightning spell doing 10d8 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one on a creature activating it (if more than one the DM can choose or determine randomly).

You choose a creature you can see within range and mark it with fiery rune. The target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 8d6 fire damage and is stunned for one minute.
A creature stunned by this spell makes another Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a successful save, it is no longer stunned.</p>

You create a long, ever-coiling whip of fire that hovers within range. It lasts for the duration.
When the whip appears, you make a melee spell attack against a target of your choice within 5 feet of the whip. On a hit, the target must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 4d6 fire damage and be restrained by the whip until the spell ends. A creature that starts its turn restrained by the whip takes 4d6 fire damage.
A creature retrained by the whip can use its action to make a Strength or Dexterity check (its choice) against your spell save DC. On a success, it frees itself.
Until the spell ends, you can use a bonus action on each of your turns to move the whip up to 20 feet to a spot you can see and repeat the attack against the same target or a different one.</p>

You return a dead creature you touch to life if it has been dead for no less than 1 minute. If the creature&rsquo;s soul is both willing and at liberty to rejoin the body, the creature painfully returns to life with all its hit points.
This spell also neutralizes any poisons and cures diseases that affected the creature at the time it died. This spell doesn&rsquo;t, however, remove magical diseases, curses, or similar effects; if these aren&rsquo;t first removed prior to casting the spell, they take effect when the creature returns to life. The spell can&rsquo;t return an undead creature to life.
This spell closes all mortal wounds and restores any missing body parts.

<h3 id="awakening">Awakening<a class="headerlink" href="#awakening" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>7<sup>th</sup>-level Enchantment or Invocation</p>
<p>Range:Touch</p>
<p>Components:V, S, M</p>
<p>Duration:Permanent</p>
<p>Casting Time:2 rounds</p>
<p>Area of Effect:One item</p>
<p>Saving Throw:Special</p>
<p>This spell is used to activate a touched magical item bearing mul¬tiple enchantments or exhibiting multiple functions. It is an alterna¬tive to the better-known enchant an item spell, but accomplishes less. To create a magical item with an awakening spell, several other spells must be used first, including eternal flame and usually wondrous web or holy vesting and various dweomerflow castings. Awakening can be used on a magical item that has been created with an enchant an item spell if additional powers are added to the item after its initial creation and enough use of the item has occurred to call upon all of the original powers at least once.</p>
<p>When the spell is cast, the item must make a saving throw to determine if the awakening has been successful. The item&rsquo;s base saving throw is the same as the caster&rsquo;s saving throw vs. spell, modified as follows: a -1 penalty per being other than the spell- caster who cast spells on the item during preparation or con¬tributed magics that were put into the item before the awakening attempt, a +1 bonus per meld and crown meld spell existing on the item, and a +1 bonus if both an eternal flame and a Veladar&rsquo;s</p>
<p>vambrace, Nulathoe&rsquo;s ninemen, or holy might spell were cast on the item before the awakening attempt. These bonuses are cumu¬lative, but a roll of 1 is always a failure.</p>
<p>The failure of an awakening attempt means either the item crumbles to worthless dust or explodes violently. Roll 1d6; a result of 1 or 2 means an explosion occurs similar to a fireball centered on the item that deals 1d6 points of damage per level of the awak¬ening caster and in addition destroys the item utterly. A roll of 4-6 means that the item collapses into dust. A wind will rise from nowhere to carry this dust away, and even if some dust is some¬how retained, it is magically inert and worthless.</p>
<p>Success of the awakening attempt means the item is awakened instantly into operation. It functions perfectly, though if the creator has been careless or inattentive in his or her preparations, the item&rsquo;s performance may involve some surprises. A successful awak¬ening may be heralded by a flash of light from the item, but this effect is never a harmful discharge of wild magic or item powers.</p>
<p>The material components for this spell are a single wizard spell scroll bearing at least as many spells as the item has functions, a gem of any sort of not less than 2,500 gp value each for each item function, and a living plant that has been altered by magic. Some sages believe an awakening is more likely to succeed (an additional +l bonus to the item&rsquo;s saving throw at the DM&rsquo;s discretion) if a random dweomer-bearing component is also present in the spell¬casting components.</p>

<p>A line of searing wind 100 feet long and 10 feet wide blasts out from you in a direction you choose for the spell&rsquo;s duration. Each creature that starts its turn in the line takes 6d8 fire damage and must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be pushed 15 feet away from you in a direction following the line.</p>
<p>Any creature in the line must spend 2 feet of movement for every 1 foot it moves when moving closer to you.</p>
<p>The wind disperses gas or vapour, and it extinguishes candles, torches, and similar unprotected flames. It causes protected flames, such as those of lanterns, to dance wildly and has a 75 percent chance to extinguish them, while fanning larger fires in the area. The wind has a 50 percent chance every turn to ignite flammable objects in the area that aren&rsquo;t being worn or carried.
As a bonus action on each of your turns before the spell ends, you can change the direction in which the line emanates from you.</p>

All thunder attacks within 300 feet of the staff are made with disadvantage and saving throws against thunder are made with advantage; all creatures within 300 feet of the staff resist thunder damage. The spell ceases to function if the staff is moved before the 30<sup>th</sup> day. If the staff is removed after the 30<sup>th</sup> day, it functions as a limited staff of thunder and lightning, except it can only produce one thunder or thunderclap effect for each full 10 days that it was in place before the staff loses its potency.

<p>Duration: 1 hour</p>
<p>You make one mindless or willing corporeal undead look different, including clothing, armor, weapons, and equipment. You can make it seem one foot shorter or taller, and anywhere between very thin or very fat. You cannot change the creature&rsquo;s body type, however: bipedal creatures retain that form. Otherwise, the extent of the change is entirely up to you. This spell can alter how the creature in question smells, as well, allowing even rotting undead to be disguised by it - although the spell does only work in the moment, so that a putrescent undead disguised by it will fool viewers in the moment, but may leave the stench of death in its wake.</p>
<p>The changes wrought by the spell fail to hold up to physical inspection. For example, if you use this spell to add a hat to the undead creature, objects pass through the hat, and anyone who touches it would feel only the creature&rsquo;s true form beneath. To discern that the undead is disguised, a creature can use its action to inspect its appearance and must succeed on an Intelligence <span><span class="MathJax_Preview">Investigation</span><script type="math/tex">Investigation</script></span> check against your spell save DC.</p>

<p>One of the works of Wyara of Mystra, dweomerflow is a work of meta-magic, creating a field of magic that encompasses another spell and shifts them into or out of a receptacle without permitting the spell to manifest normally. There are two forms of this spell, which the caster chooses to use when the spell is cast.</p>
<p>Fill Receptacle: With this version, the spell causes the next spell the target casts to flow from the caster into a prepared receptacle instead of taking its usual effect. Only receptacles innately prepared to accept a spell can be targeted by this effect. These include a focal stone, a magic item into which spells can be stored, or other myriad items, such as crucibles empowered to accept enchantments, certain artifacts, and the like. If the magic item is one that can already accept spells <span><span class="MathJax_Preview">such as a ring of spell storing</span><script type="math/tex">such as a ring of spell storing</script></span>, the spell level limit of the item becomes equal to the level at which dweomerflow is cast instead of its normal limits. This function can also be used with effects such as glyph of warding; in that case, the subsequent spell cast is imbued into the glyph as a secondary magical effect that is triggered at the same time as its main effect.</p>
<p>Charge Transference: With this version, the caster may alter the charges contained by magic items that use them, such as wands. It functions as the Fill Receptacle effect above, but the spell that is cast into the item must be one of the spells that item can cast, and it regains a number of charges equal to the cost of casting that charge for the item. Alternately, it can be used to siphon charges from one item to another, transferring up to one charge per level of spell slot used in casting dweomerflow. Excess charges are wasted, and an item that is reduced to 0 charges has its normal effect. If one or both of these items are in the possession of an unwilling owner, that owner is permitted an Intelligence save to totally negate the effect.</p>
<p>At Higher Levels: When this spell is cast using a spell slot of 5<sup>th</sup> or higher, increase the possible spell levels of the effects noted above.</p>

<p>You immediately peruse a spell as it is being cast <span><span class="MathJax_Preview">as a Reaction</span><script type="math/tex">as a Reaction</script></span>, is currently in effect <span><span class="MathJax_Preview">if it has no visible effects, you must study it while using detect magic</span><script type="math/tex">if it has no visible effects, you must study it while using detect magic</script></span> or that is in written form before you. You tap into the Weave to discern the pattern of that magic, and then fill your mind with its weft. As long as you are able to prepare a spell of that level, you prepare the studied spell; if necessary, you lose a spell you already have prepared in order to make room for the new one. As long as you retain the prepared spell, you may scribe it or cast it as normal.</p>
<p>If the spell is too high in level for you to cast, you take 1d6 radiant damage per spell level above your ability from the attempt to read and incorporate something of spell power too great for you to manage.</p>

<p>Duration: 1 minute</p>
<p>Your hands burst into flames that emit noxious smoke and shed light as torches. While the spell is active, you may use your action to make a melee spell attack against one adjacent creature. Creatures hit by your touch take 4d6 fire damage and must make a Constitution saving throw against your spell- casting DC or be poisoned until the end of your next turn.</p>
<p>At Higher Levels. When you cast the spell using a slot of 5<sup>th</sup> level or higher, you may make two at- tacks when you use your action to make a melee spell attack with your fiery fists.</p>

<p>You make a non-magical flame <span><span class="MathJax_Preview">equivalent to a can- dle, torch or campfire</span><script type="math/tex">equivalent to a can- dle, torch or campfire</script></span> erupt in an arrow, firing at a creature within 5 feet before extinguishing itself. You extinguish the target flame and the creature must make a Dexterity saving throw. If your target was a candle, the creature takes 2d4 damage on a failed saving throw. If your target was a torch, the creature takes 2d6 damage on a failed saving throw. If your target was a campfire <span><span class="MathJax_Preview">up to a 5-foot cube of flame</span><script type="math/tex">up to a 5-foot cube of flame</script></span>, the creature takes 2d8 damage on a failed saving throw.</p>
<p>At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2<sup>nd</sup> level or higher, the target takes an additional die of damage for each slot level above 1<sup>st</sup>.</p>

<p>Range: Touch</p>
<p>Components: V, S, M <span><span class="MathJax_Preview">a dagger</span><script type="math/tex">a dagger</script></span></p>
<p>Duration: 1 minute</p>
<p>You toss a dagger into the air and it is borne aloft by the winds. For the duration of the spell, the dagger hovers and you may use your action to make a ranged weapon attack with the dagger against a target creature or object within 60 feet of you. When you do so, you may use your spellcasting ability in place of your Strength or Dexterity for the attack and damage roll.</p>
<p>As you increase in level, this spell can animate additional daggers, and make attacks with them simultaneously. It can animate two daggers at 5<sup>th</sup> level, three at 11<sup>th</sup> level, and 4 at 17<sup>th</sup> level.</p>

<p>Components: V, S, M <span><span class="MathJax_Preview">a silver bar with 50gp</span><script type="math/tex">a silver bar with 50gp</script></span></p>
<p>Duration: Permanent</p>
<p>You permanently seal a gate or portal you designate within range as part of the casting. This prevents any activation of the gate or portal, although the gate seal remains as a magical effect around the gate or portal, and is subject to effects such as dispel magic. A knock does not function on a gate seal, though a chime of opening does.</p>
<p>Gembolt</p>
<p>3<sup>rd</sup>-level evocation</p>
<p>Casting Time: 1 action</p>
<p>Range: 200 feet</p>
<p>Duration: Instantaneous</p>
<p>Holding aloft a gemstone, you map tap into the power locked within it, causing it to streak forth in the form of a bolt of energy that shimmers with the same hue as the stone itself, striking a single target in range. This inflicts six dice worth of damage, with the specific die type being based on the quality of the gem: ornamental gems inflict d4s of damage, semiprecious inflict d6s of damage, and precious stones inflict d8s.</p>
<p>This does not consume the gemstone, although you may choose to do so in the casting. In such case, the damage is d6s for ornamental stones, d8s for semiprecious and d10s for precious. All that remains of the stone after the casting is simple, inert grey dust of half the volume of the original stone.</p>
<p>At Higher Level: For each level of spell above 3<sup>rd</sup> used to cast this spell, increase the damage by one additional die.</p>
<p>Material Component: A gemstone of ornamental, semiprecious or precious quality. This does not usually consume the stone, but you may choose to have the casting of the spell do so in order to inflict additional damage.</p>
<p>Glyph of Revealing</p>
<p>2<sup>nd</sup>-level evocation <span><span class="MathJax_Preview">ritual</span><script type="math/tex">ritual</script></span></p>
<p>Casting Time: 1 action</p>
<p>Range: Touch</p>
<p>Duration: 1 hour</p>
<p>You write a glyph upon any surface that will retain the ink necessary to cast the spell, even for just a few seconds. When it is complete, the glyph glows for a moment and then sends out a wave of white light 120&rsquo; in every direction and then vanishes. When the wave of light touches anything magical, it begins to glow with a white radiance the same brightness as faerie fire. The outlines of magically hidden inscriptions or magical writing of any kind is immediately revealed. This allows them to be read without triggering their effects.</p>
<p>Material Components: An ink made of the juiced of crushed eyebright, white chalk and crushed quartz.</p>
<p>Gods Granted: Any god that can grant the Knowledge or Logos Domains.</p>

<p>Duration: x</p>
<p>The spellcaster causes large hailstones <span><span class="MathJax_Preview">2 inches across and greater</span><script type="math/tex">2 inches across and greater</script></span> to rain down in an cylindrical area 30 feet across and 30 feet high. As the magically conductive hailstones fall, they spark with lighting that leaps from stone to stone in a torrent, filling the area with a web of blue-white burning threads and the smell of ozone. Creatures in the area of effect take 6d6 points of lightning and bludgeoning damage and are knocked prone. A Strength save prevents being knocked prone, and reduces the damage to half.</p>
<p>At Higher Levels: When this spell is cast using a spell slot of 5<sup>th</sup> level or higher, add 1d6 damage to the damage for each spell slot above 4<sup>th</sup>.</p>
<p>Holy Star</p>
<p>7<sup>th</sup>-level abjuration</p>
<p>Casting Time: 1 action</p>
<p>Range: Self</p>
<p>Components: V, S</p>
<p>Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute</p>
<p>You create a gleaming magical construct about the size of a dinner plate in the shape of a star. It stays near your shoulder, providing light out to 20&rsquo;, and dim light for a further 20&rsquo;. This star has the following three functions, and you can designate which function to activate as a free action on your turn.</p>
<p>Protection. You gain a +3 AC bonus from the holy star, which swerves to intercept attacks against you.</p>
<p>Starbolt. As an action, you may cause the holy star to fire a bolt of searing white-blue stellar fire at a target within 90 feet. This attack uses your spell attack bonus, and inflicts 8d6 radiant and lightning damage <span><span class="MathJax_Preview">creatures must be resistant or immune to both to apply such defenses</span><script type="math/tex">creatures must be resistant or immune to both to apply such defenses</script></span>.</p>
<p>Spell Reflection. As a reaction, you can cause the holy star to reflect back a spell directed at you or that includes you in its area of effect. The holy star may reflect up to six levels worth of spells; as a spell is reflected, the level of that spell is subtracted from the remaining levels worth of spell turning available. When a spell is reflected, its target is simply moved to the originator of the spell - all other effects are as though the original caster were still its caster. If there are not enough levels left to reflect a spell, they may still be expended to instead counter it, as though by a counterspell cast at a level equal to the number of spell levels available. If the last spell level of a holy star&rsquo;s spell reflection is used, the spell ends early.</p>

<p>1<sup>st</sup>-level evocation</p>
<p>Casting Time: 1 action</p>
<p>Range: Touch</p>
<p>Duration: Instantaneous</p>
<p>You touch the target of the spell, refreshing it and undoing the effects of weariness. The creature&rsquo;s Exhaustion Level drops by one.</p>
<p>At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2<sup>nd</sup> level or higher, it reduces Exhaustion Level by another step for each level above 1<sup>st</sup>.</p>
<p>Irithra&rsquo;s Spelltouch</p>
<p>2<sup>nd</sup>-level enchantment</p>
<p>Casting Time: 10 minutes</p>
<p>Range: Touch</p>
<p>Duration: 1 hour, or until discharged</p>
<p>You cast this spell on a non-living item. Another spell is then cast &ldquo;into&rdquo; that item on the subsequent round - you do not have to be the caster of the second. This second spell is then &ldquo;stored&rdquo; in the item, awaiting touch by a trigger creature.</p>
<p>You determine the trigger creature when you create this spell: it can be race and/or sex, or by &ldquo;type&rdquo; <span><span class="MathJax_Preview">undead, etc</span><script type="math/tex">undead, etc</script></span>. When the trigger creature touches the item, the stored spell is unleashed, taking immediate effect as though cast by the one who cast that spell into the item.</p>
<p>This second spell cannot be directed <span><span class="MathJax_Preview">i.e., it must work without choosing a specific target</span><script type="math/tex">i.e., it must work without choosing a specific target</script></span>, and the item is ground zero for any spell effect. Neither you nor the caster of the second spell can trigger the stored spell, even if you meet the requirements for the trigger. Someone may throw the item to strike a target, making a normal Dexterity attack roll to do so. If the item hits a creature that is its trigger, the magic is unleashed.</p>
<p>The spelltouch item radiates magic faintly, and identifying magics never reveal more than the fact that this item has &ldquo;a single to-be-triggered magic stored by another, underlying enchantment&rdquo;. If the spelltouched item is shattered or more than half of it is broken away, the stored spell is lost, silently and harmlessly dissipating. This also occurs if the spelltouched item comes within the area of effect of a dispel magic effect, or within 10 feet of any other spelltouched item.</p>
<p>Higher Levels: For each spell level beyond 2<sup>nd</sup> level this spell is cast at, double the duration <span><span class="MathJax_Preview">so 2 hours at 3rd level, 4 hours at 4th, etc</span><script type="math/tex">so 2 hours at 3rd level, 4 hours at 4th, etc</script></span>.</p>

<p>Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes</p>
<p>You can burrow through nonmagical, unworked earth and stone at your normal speed. While burrow- ing, you cannot be tracked except by magical means nor can any creatures follow you; you do not disturb the sand or earth that you burrow through. If you have not ceased to burrow when the spell ends, you are forcibly ejected to nearest inhabitable space and take 5d4 damage.</p>
<p>At Higher Levels. If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5<sup>th</sup> level or higher, you can target one additional creature that you can touch per spell slot level above 4<sup>th</sup>.</p>
<p>Lightning Rod</p>

<p>Components: V, S, M <span><span class="MathJax_Preview">braided copper wire</span><script type="math/tex">braided copper wire</script></span></p>
<p>Duration: Until discharged, or 1 day</p>
<p>This spell forces magical lightning to a specific spot imbued with this spell. When cast, the wizard touches the material component to the target object, which cannot be animate, living, or magical, nor can it weight more than 100 pounds. When any part of a ranged magical attack of 3<sup>rd</sup> level or lower that inflicts lightning damage passes within 150 feet of the item thus imbued, the attack is diverted away and pulled into the item imbued with lightning rod.</p>
<p>If someone is in contact with the item affected by lightning rod, that person receives the full damage of the attack; if the attack normally permits a Dexterity saving throw, it instead becomes a Constitution saving throw that is made at disadvantage. Though nominally a defensive spell used to ground out lightning attacks by an enemy, Rogaster was also fond of using this spell offensively, imbuing an enemy&rsquo;s breastplate or weapon.</p>
<p>At Higher Levels: When this spell is cast using a spell slot of 3<sup>rd</sup> level or higher, increase the level of the spell the lightning rod may coopt by two levels for each spell slot level above the 2<sup>nd</sup>. Thus, a 3<sup>rd</sup> level spell slot may ground out up to a 5<sup>th</sup> level spell, a 4<sup>th</sup> level spell slot may ground out up to a 7<sup>th</sup> level spell, and a 5<sup>th</sup> level spell slot may ground out up to a 9<sup>th</sup> level spell.</p>
<p>Mantle of Mystra</p>
<p>4<sup>th</sup>-level abjuration</p>
<p>Casting Time: 10 minutes</p>
<p>Range: Self</p>
<p>Duration: 1 year, or until discharged</p>
<p>The spell creative an invisible protective aura around you. Choose any spell that you have cast, felt the effects of or observed cast, or a spell that you know the specific name of, of any level equal to or lower than the spell slot level used to cast this spell. The first time you are struck by this spell, the mantle of Mystra absorbs it perfectly, negating its effects and then rechannels it into an immediate casting of another spell that you know how to cast and sends that spell back at the original caster. The spell that is sent against the target must be equal to or lower in level than the one it absorbed. Both of these spell selections must be made when the mantle of Mystra is cast.</p>
<p>Higher Level: This spell may be cast at higher levels in order to absorb and reflect spells of higher than 4<sup>th</sup> level.</p>
<p>Gods Granted: Mystra, Azuth</p>
<p>Maskstone</p>

<p>Casting Time: 1 action</p>
<p>Range: Touch</p>
<p>Duration: 1 year</p>
<p>You weave a complicated illusion over a stone surface. The illusion is simply that of any kind of solid, unbroken stone surface, hiding any seams, carvings or even openings. The stone created by the illusion blends perfectly with the surrounding stone in appearance.</p>
<p>Anyone with reason to doubt the veracity of the illusion may make a Wisdom save to pierce it <span><span class="MathJax_Preview">dwarves, gnomes and other subterranean denizens gain advantage on this save</span><script type="math/tex">dwarves, gnomes and other subterranean denizens gain advantage on this save</script></span>. The illusion is visual-only, and touching it can reveal any details concealed by the spell that could be sensed by touch, also granting advantage on the save.</p>
<p>At Higher Level: Casting this spell at higher spell levels increases the duration to 5 years at 3<sup>rd</sup> level, a decade at 4<sup>th</sup>, twenty years at 5<sup>th</sup> and a full century at 6<sup>th</sup>. Each spell level after that adds an additional century to the duration.</p>
<p>Gods Granted: Any god in the dwarven or gnomish pantheons.</p>
<p>Mind Mantle</p>
<p>2<sup>nd</sup>-level abjuration</p>
<p>Casting Time: 1 action</p>
<p>Range: Touch</p>
<p>Duration: 1 hour</p>
<p>You create a cloaking web of random mental impulses that screens the mind of the one protected by the spell. All mind-reading and influencing spells of 4<sup>th</sup> level or less are useless against the one thus protected, as are magic items or other powers that mimic those effects. The caster may end it by silent act of will.</p>
<p>Higher Levels: For every level above 2<sup>nd</sup> this spell is cast at, it lasts one additional hour.</p>
<p>Poisonstar</p>
<p>2<sup>nd</sup>-level evocation</p>
<p>Casting Time: 1 action</p>
<p>Range: Self</p>
<p>Components: V,S</p>
<p>Duration: 1 minute or until stars are discharged</p>
<p>This spell creates six vivid purple winking stars around one of your hands. At any time within the duration, you may cause a number of these stars to race after a target of your choice, deploying either a number equal to your Intelligence bonus as a standard action, or a single star as a bonus action. Targets may make a Dexterity saving throw to resist being struck; success on this save causes the star to also wink out of existence. This save is at disadvantage if the target is attacked with a number of stars equal to or greater than the target&rsquo;s Dexterity bonus.</p>
<p>A living creature struck by one of these stars takes 1 point of poison damage, or 2 points if the creature is undead. Living creatures must also make a Constitution save or become Intoxicated for one minute <span><span class="MathJax_Preview">though at the end of each of their rounds, they may attempt to throw off the remaining effects with another Constitution save</span><script type="math/tex">though at the end of each of their rounds, they may attempt to throw off the remaining effects with another Constitution save</script></span>.</p>

<p>Portal Well</p>
<p>2<sup>nd</sup>-level transmutation</p>
<p>Casting Time: 1 action</p>
<p>Range: Touch</p>
<p>Components: V, S, M <span><span class="MathJax_Preview">silver wire tied into a knot</span><script type="math/tex">silver wire tied into a knot</script></span></p>
<p>Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes</p>
<p>You alter the operation of a portal you target with this spell. Upon entering it, accompanied by up to five others, you are transported into an extradimensional pocket instead of the other side of the portal. This only functions on a portal which you can use.</p>
<p>The extradimensional space created by this spell is similar to that created by rope trick. While within it, you can see both ends of the portal, although it is murky and indistinct, as viewed through a fog. When the spell ends, you exit the space at either end of the portal, according to your choice.</p>
<p>A successful dispel magic or other magic that inhibits the functioning of the portal traps you in the space for the duration of that effect, although creatures within the space may make an Intelligence save at the casting of the spell to be ejected from their choice of portal end to avoid being so trapped. Any effects that destroy the portal ejects all creatures within from a random end of the portal, inflicting 5d6 points of force damage to them; each creature is ejected out of a different end of the portal.</p>
<p>At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3<sup>rd</sup> level or higher, you increase the duration of spell. It becomes &ldquo;Concentration, up to 30 minutes&rdquo; at 3<sup>rd</sup> level, and &ldquo;Concentration, up to 1 hour&rdquo; at 4<sup>th</sup> level. At 5<sup>th</sup> level, the Concentration component ends, the duration simply becoming &ldquo;1 hour&rdquo;, and then doubling for each spell slot level above 5<sup>th</sup>.</p>

<p>Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute</p>
<p>The touched target of this spell gains resistance to bludgeoning, slashing, and piercing damage that derives from non-magical ranged weapons.</p>
<p>At Higher Levels: For every level above 2<sup>nd</sup> this spell is cast at, it protects one additional target touched as part of the action spent casting it.</p>

<p>Duration: Instantaneous</p>
<p>An undead creature you touch regains a number of hit points equal to 1d6+your spellcasting ability modifier.</p>
<p>At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2<sup>nd</sup> level or higher, the healing increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 1<sup>st</sup>.</p>
<p>Gods Granted: Any gods that grant the Death or Grave Domains.</p>
<p>Rockburst</p>
<p>2<sup>nd</sup>-level transmutation</p>
<p>Casting Time: 1 action</p>
<p>Range: 60 feet</p>
<p>Duration: Instantaneous</p>
<p>You cause a selection of stone to suddenly explode in all directions, spraying jagged stone shrapnel in a 20&rsquo; radius of it. Damage inflicted is based on how much stone is destroyed by the casting: for each 1 cubic foot of rock, it inflicts 1d4+1 die of piercing damage. The spell may destroy up to four cubic feet of rock, giving it a maximum damage of 4d4+4 piercing damage, but only if sufficient stone exists to be affected.</p>
<p>This spell destroys the structural integrity of the stone in question, and so can do damage to structures, caverns and the like as well. If intending to inflict such damage towards a specific purpose, you must make a successful Intelligence check with a DC determined by your DM, based on how difficult your goal is.</p>
<p>At Higher Level: For each spell level above the 2<sup>nd</sup> used to cast this spell, you may affect one additional cubic foot of stone.</p>
<p>Rune of Power</p>
<p>1<sup>st</sup>-level evocation</p>
<p>Casting Time: 1 action</p>
<p>Range: Touch</p>
<p>Duration: 1 day</p>
<p>You touch a surface of stone or metal, leaving behind a dwarven rune-sigil. You may cause the rune to discharge on the round following its creation, or it may &ldquo;wait&rdquo; for a trigger. The baseline rune triggers when a living or undead creature moves within five feet of it, though you may give it exceptions to this. You determine the situations under which the rune does not discharge its power, establishing a number of these exemptions equal to three plus your proficiency bonus. A rune disappears once its duration has passed, or once it is discharged.</p>
<p>The effects of this rune is based on what specific rune is wrought through its use. When learned, you know how to create a Basic rune. Research and discovery can reveal other such runes of power.</p>

<p>Material Component: Casting a rune of power requires the sacrifice of a gemstone of some quality. Ornamental gemstones are required for effects of up to 3<sup>rd</sup> level, and semiprecious for higher levels than that. There are thought to be runes or techniques for casting a rune of power with precious stones that may imbue them with greater power or even permanency, but those secrets may be lost.</p>

<p>Range: 60 ft</p>
<p>Duration: 1 round</p>
<p>Choose a point within range that has a number of small, unsecured objects - rocks, marbles, dinnerware, caltrops and the like. There is a sudden flash from the center of those objects, which go flying in all directions, literally rebounding back into the field when they hit the edge of the spell&rsquo;s effect, filling it with flying projectiles. Each creature <span><span class="MathJax_Preview">other than the caster himself</span><script type="math/tex">other than the caster himself</script></span> in a 10-foot-radius cloud centered on that spot must make a Dexterity saving throw or take 1d4 bludgeoning damage. Spellcasters caught in the area must make a Constitution save for suffering from severe distractions. The caster may also choose non-injurous articles, such as fruit, eggs or rag dolls, which fly around as normal, but inflict no damage.</p>
<p>Material Component: The material components of the spell are the items themselves and a flint and steel or tinderbox.</p>

<p>Duration: Instantaneous</p>
<p>A darting streak of lightning flashes from your pointing finger to a point you choose within range and then rapidly expands in all directions into a sphere of arcing blue-white electrical bolts. Each creature in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make a Dexterity saving throw. A target takes 8d6 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The electricity spreads around corners.</p>
<p>At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4<sup>th</sup> level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 3<sup>rd</sup>.</p>

<p>Duration: 8 hours</p>
<p>You touch a willing creature to grant it the ability to see through water. For the duration, that creature has darkvision 60 feet while underwater, can see twice as far as the water’s visibility would normally allow, and suffers no penalties for making attacks in or into the water with a piercing or slashing weapon.

<p>Shadow Bolt</p>
<p>3<sup>rd</sup>-level illusion</p>
<p>Casting Time: 1 action</p>
<p>Range: 90 ft</p>
<p>Components: V, S</p>
<p>Duration: 1 round</p>
<p>You select a target within the spell&rsquo;s range. This target suddenly perceives a small mote of darkness that quickly grows larger, appearing as though it were coming from some far distance behind you. It rushes in with a frightening moaning sound and rushing of air during the round in which it is cast. It does not strike the target until the end of the target&rsquo;s next turn. Like a magic missile, this projectile strikes unerringly, even following the target around corners.</p>
<p>When this spell is cast, the target is permitted a Wisdom save against your spell save DC. If the target fails this save, the target believes that the attack has come from somewhere else, and receives 5d8 psychic damage when struck, and falls prone. If the save is successful, the target takes half damage and comprehends the true source of the spell.</p>
<p>At Higher Levels.&rsquo; When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4<sup>th</sup> level or higher, its damage is increased by 1d8 ft for every level above the 3<sup>rd</sup>.</p>

<p>Components: V, S, M <span><span class="MathJax_Preview">piece of bone</span><script type="math/tex">piece of bone</script></span></p>
<p>Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute</p>
<p>You create a small cluster of three skeletons that are semi-real phantasms. They can be of any appearance you wish for them, though they always appear as skeletal humanoids. They cannot be turned, and though they appear solid, they are not. As a bonus action, you can impel any number of your skeletons to attack a target. This attack uses your spell attack bonus, and if successful causes the skeleton to pass through the target, inflicting 2d6 necrotic damage. Additionally, a target must make a Constitution save against your spell DC or take the Stunned Condition until the end of its next turn.</p>
<p>The skeletons have an AC 14, and though they do not take damage, any successful attack against them forces the caster to make a concentration check to avoid the spell being disrupted. If this damage is radiant, the concentration check is made at disadvantage.</p>

It is also more effective against firey creatures.</p>

<p>Spell Phylactery</p>
<p>5<sup>th</sup>-level transmutation</p>
<p>Casting Time: 10 minutes</p>
<p>Range: Touch</p>
<p>Components: V, S</p>
<p>Duration: Permanent until triggered or wears away</p>
<p>You imbue a spell scroll with a set of conditions that will trigger the casting of that spell scroll automatically. The spell on the scroll must be one that affects your person, and cannot be higher than 2<sup>nd</sup> level.</p>
<p>The conditions that trigger the spell must be clear, although they can be as specific or general as the caster wishes. Only phenomenon which the caster can perceive are viable triggering phenomenon, even if the caster is not aware of them at the time of triggering.</p>
<p>These scrolls must be worn around the head or wrists, often by creating small boxes or folded cloth around the paper scroll proper. As such, you can only wear up to three such phylacteries, and you of course may not be wearing other items at head and wrists. This spell remains in place for up to 24 hours after the phylactery is removed; if it is not put back on before then, the magic dissipates.</p>
<p>At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6<sup>th</sup> level or higher, increase the level of the spell that can be on the scroll to 3<sup>rd</sup> level with a 6<sup>th</sup> level spell slot, and one more level for every other level of spell slot thereafter <span><span class="MathJax_Preview">so 3rd for a 6th level spell slot, 4th for a 7th level spell slot, and 5th for a 9th level spell slot</span><script type="math/tex">so 3rd for a 6th level spell slot, 4th for a 7th level spell slot, and 5th for a 9th level spell slot</script></span>.</p>

<p>Spell Shield</p>
<p>3<sup>rd</sup>-level abjuration</p>
<p>Casting Time: 1 action</p>
<p>Range: Touch</p>
<p>Components: V, S</p>
<p>Duration: 1 minute</p>
<p>This spell protects the target of the spell from all magic in the following ways:</p>
<p>Target gains advantage on saves against all spells;</p>
<p>Target is immune to all illusion and enchantment spells of 2<sup>nd</sup> level or lower</p>
<p>The shield generates a pool of 25 points of damage. Half of all magical damage is taken by the shield instead. The spell ends if this damage pool is depleted.</p>
<p>At Higher Levels. If this spell is cast using a higher level spell slot, the defended target is rendered immune to illusion and enchantment spells of the level below that for the duration of the protection, and the pool of absorbed damage is increased by 10 per level above 3<sup>rd</sup>.</p>
<p>Spellmantle</p>
<p>6<sup>th</sup>-level abjuration</p>
<p>Casting Time: 1 action</p>
<p>Range: Touch</p>
<p>Components: V, S</p>
<p>Duration: Concentration, up to 2 hours</p>
<p>You place a magical aura around the target of the spell, a single creature that must be touched as the spell is cast. As part of casting, you may designate any combination of warded or activated spells.</p>
<p>Warded spells are spells of 4<sup>th</sup> level or lower that you can prepare <span><span class="MathJax_Preview">wizards may choose any spell in their spell books, for instance</span><script type="math/tex">wizards may choose any spell in their spell books, for instance</script></span> that you wish to protect the target from. When the target of the spell is subject to one of the designated spells, the spellmantle absorbs the incoming spell&rsquo;s energy completely without any action.</p>
<p>Activated spells are spells of 4<sup>th</sup> level or lower that you currently know or have prepared that will be cast on the target when a warded spell of at least equal level is absorbed. This spell is cast on the target of the spell as a reaction, triggered by the absorption of a warded spell. Activated spells may even be spells with a Range of Self, allowing the subject of the spell to receive spells a caster couldn&rsquo;t normally cast on them. Warded spells cannot be used to trigger activated spells higher in level than the warded spell.</p>
<p>For example, Evendur casts spellmantle on Glim. He chooses fireball and lightning bolt as the warded spells, and blink and magic weapon as the activated spells. When Glim is targeted by a fireball or a lightning bolt, she may choose - as a reaction - to immediately be targeted by a casting of blink or magic weapon.</p>
<p>At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7<sup>th</sup> or higher level, gain one additional spell to your allotment of spells that can be designated as warded or activated spells for each spell level beyond the 6<sup>th</sup>. Additionally, the spells&rsquo; maximum level becomes two less than the spell slot used, rather than 4<sup>th</sup>.</p>
<p>Stars of Mystra</p>
<p>4<sup>th</sup>-level conjuration</p>
<p>Casting Time: 1 action</p>
<p>Range: 60 ft.</p>
<p>Components: V, S</p>
<p>Duration: 1 hour</p>
<p>You create six twinkling stars that orbit your head like ioun stones, casting light in a 10&rsquo; radius, and dim light out another 10&rsquo;. Beginning on the turn you cast the spell, you can launch one star as a bonus action at a target you designate within range, making a spell attack roll to hit.</p>
<p>Each time a target is struck by a star, they must make a Charisma save at your spell save DC or lose a 4<sup>th</sup> level spell slot as if the target had used it to cast a spell. If the target has no 4<sup>th</sup>-level spell slots, they lose a spell slot of their next highest spell level. If they have no spell slots of 1<sup>st</sup> through 4<sup>th</sup> levels, the star instead inflicts 2d4 radiant damage and bursts in a distinctive way, communicating this fact to you.</p>

<p>Rather than constantly reverse engineer damaging evocations into the lightning magics he favored, Rogaster Stormson <span><span class="MathJax_Preview">considered "ingeniously lazy" by Wyara's margin notes</span><script type="math/tex">considered "ingeniously lazy" by Wyara's margin notes</script></span> developed this spell. When cast, it creates a field of unseen magic that transmutes the next spell cast by the caster which creates damaging magic. As that second spell is cast, it transmutes the damage type of the second spell to lightning, replacing whatever the original damage type is. This spell is explicitly exempt from the normal limitations around casting two non-cantrip spells in the same action. If the caster does not follow up the casting of this spell with another damaging spell, its effects end by the end of the next turn, the spell slot spent and the magic wasted.</p>
<p>Sunbolt</p>
<p>2<sup>nd</sup>-level evocation</p>

<p>Range: 120 feet</p>
<p>Components: V, S</p>
<p>Duration: Instantaneous</p>
<p>A ray of burning sunlight springs from your hand. Make a ranged spell attack to hit your target. A creature struck by the bolt takes 3d8 radiant damage and must make a Dexterity save. On a failed save, the target is also blinded for 1 round. Creatures with sunlight-based limitations take double damage as though they possessed a Damage Vulnerability to radiant damage.</p>
<p>At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3<sup>rd</sup> level or higher, the duration of blindness is increased by 1 round for each slot level above 2<sup>nd</sup>.</p>

<p>Components: V or S</p>
<p>Duration: Instant</p>
<p>This spell creates an audible sound centered anywhere within the spell&rsquo;s range. This limits on this spell&rsquo;s manifestation is that it must be a sound the caster is himself capable of making - all spoken voices will be those of the caster <span><span class="MathJax_Preview">although skilled vocal mimics can be very effective in this regard</span><script type="math/tex">although skilled vocal mimics can be very effective in this regard</script></span>. Targets distracted by these sounds are permitted an Intelligence save to not fall for the illusion.

<p>Teleport Object</p>

<p>Range: Touch</p>
<p>Components: V, S, M <span><span class="MathJax_Preview">a brass key</span><script type="math/tex">a brass key</script></span></p>
<p>Duration: Instant</p>
<p>This spell involves the magical teleportation of objects to a prepared receptacle for them. This spell is cast in one of three ways, depending on the purpose of the spell.</p>
<p>Prepare Receptacle. With this, the caster prepares a receptacle to hold items that he sends into it. It is, in effect, the creation of a &ldquo;landing pad&rdquo; for those items, and without at least one such receptacle, the other versions of the spell cannot be cast at all. This casting has a longer Casting Time than normal, taking 1 minute to enchant a container the size of a small chest, 10 minutes to enchant a large chest or crate, 1 hour to enchant a cabinet or wardrobe, and 10 hours to enchant a small room, of a maximum of 20&rsquo; x 20&rsquo; in size. A caster may have one such receptacle per point of his Proficiency Bonus. The casting of this spell burns a circular rune-pattern similar to those created by the teleportation circle spell, but on a smaller scale. These patterns are often hidden on the object or room, for if another caster with access to this spell learns the pattern, he may choose to make that receptacle one of his own with a simple casting of this spell.</p>
<p>Banish Item. This has a Casting Time of 1 action. With it, the caster may banish any single item of 10 pounds or less to one of his prepared receptacles, as long as that item will conceivably fit in it. The item must be held by the caster when he casts it, and no one may be contesting his physical possession of it at the time. A bag or container can be banished as a single item, and all its contents will transfer, as long as it does not weigh more than 10 pounds. Items that themselves contain extradimensional space <span><span class="MathJax_Preview">such as bags of holding</span><script type="math/tex">such as bags of holding</script></span> cannot be affected by this spell.</p>
<p>Summon Item. This has a Casting Time of 1 action. With it, the caster may summon any single item of 10 pounds or less from one of his prepared receptacles. The caster must know that the item is in that receptacle, and the item appears in his hand, which must be free and unbound to cast the spell.</p>
<p>At Higher Levels: When this spell is cast at higher levels, it increases the weight and/or number of items that may be summoned or banished. <span><span class="MathJax_Preview">It has no effect on the Prepare Receptacle function of this spell.</span><script type="math/tex">It has no effect on the Prepare Receptacle function of this spell.</script></span> At 4<sup>th</sup> level, the spell may affect up to two items of no more than 20 lbs in total weight. For each spell level thereafter, the spell may affect one additional item, and 10 additional pounds, allowing a 6<sup>th</sup> level casting of the spell to affect four items of up to 40 total lbs, as an example.</p>
<p>Wardaway</p>
<p>1<sup>st</sup>-level evocation</p>
<p>Casting Time: Swift action, or Reaction</p>
<p>Range: 60 feet</p>
<p>Components: V, S</p>
<p>Duration: 2 rounds</p>
<p>You hurl a small, shimmering sphere of twisting magical force at a single opponent in range, striking them unerringly and inflicting a -1 penalty to all attack rolls during the duration of the spell. The character also goes last in initiative order during that time as well. Additionally, the target must make a Wisdom save. Failure on this check inflicts 1d4+4 force damage to the target.</p>
<p>This spell is cast as a Swift action. The spell may be cast as a Reaction if an enemy charges. If the target fails the Wisdom save, not only do they take damage, but their charge is interrupted and they must stop movement after half of their movement has been completed in the charge.</p>
<p>Water Form</p>
<p>7<sup>th</sup>-level transmutation</p>
<p>Casting Time: 1 action</p>
<p>Range: Self</p>
<p>Components: V, S</p>
<p>Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour</p>
<p>You turn into an amorphous puddle of water that resembles an ooze. Your water form uses all of your ability scores, but has 40 hit points and AC 13 + your Dexterity modifier. You revert back to your original form if reduced to 0 hit points. While in water form you are invisible if you are in water <span><span class="MathJax_Preview">whether a body of water, a puddle, or a wet surface</span><script type="math/tex">whether a body of water, a puddle, or a wet surface</script></span>, you gain resistance to slashing, bludgeoning, and piercing damage, you are immune to cold damage and the prone condition, and are restrained until the end of your next turn if you would take cold damage. You may squeeze through tiny openings as small as one inch without penalty. You retain your normal vision and speed, but gain a swim speed equal to your normal movement. You may not attack or cast spells as an amorphous puddle of water. As an action, however, you may cause your watery form to become humanoid, which resembles your normal shape, or revert from humanoid shape to a puddle. While in humanoid form you can talk, attack, cast spells, etc., though you are visible unless completely immersed in water.</p>
<p>At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell with a spell slot of 8<sup>th</sup> level or higher, your watery form gains an additional 20 hit points per slot level used over 7<sup>th</sup>.</p>
<p>Wind Carpet</p>
<p>5<sup>th</sup>-level evocation</p>

<p>Range: Touch</p>
<p>Components: V, S, M <span><span class="MathJax_Preview">a scrap of cloth</span><script type="math/tex">a scrap of cloth</script></span></p>

The carpet emits dim light in a 10-foot radius. You can dismiss the spell as a free action on your turn or as a reaction.</p>
<p>At Higher Levels. If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6<sup>th</sup> level or higher, you may increase the carpet’s dimensions up to 4 ft. × 6 ft. using a 6<sup>th</sup> level slot, 5 ft. × 7 ft. using a 7<sup>th</sup> level slot, or 6 ft. × 9 ft. using an 8<sup>th</sup> level slot.</p>

harmless sensory effect, such as falling leaves, a puff of 
wind, the sound of a small animal, or the faint odor of 
skunk. The effect must fit in a 5-foot cube. 
• You whisper to a lesser spirit of flame to instantly light 
or snuff out a candle, a torch, or a small campfire.
• If you have the Boon feature you can create harmless 
sensory effects as appropriate to that spirit, such as the 
loud howl of a wolf.
Rapid Armament
Prerequisite: Elder Sorcerer Tradition: Magi When you cast ebon blade (or any spell which summons an ebon blade, such as witch blade) or invoke your Ebon Armor class feature, you may spend 1 arcane point to cast either ebon shield or false life as part of the same action. You can use Rapid Armament even if you have already used a different Metamagic option during the casting of the spell.
Circle of Elemental Focus
When you cast any spell that deals an elemental damage type, you may spend 1 arcane point to create a circle of crackling elemental energy of that same damage type at your feet. This circle remains stationary for 1 minute. As long as you are standing within the circle any spell you cast of the same elemental damage type deals additional damage equal to your spell casting attribute modifier (minimum of one). If you choose to create another circle of elemental focus while one is still active that circle dissipates as you enact a new one.
Elemental Admixture
Prerequisite: Elorii
When you cast any spell that deals an elemental damage type you may spend 1 arcane point to change half of the spell’s damage type to the damage type akin to your elemental bloodline. For example, if you cast a fireball and are an Osalikene (Bloodline of Air) you may spend 1 arcane point to change half of the damage dealt to lightning damage.
