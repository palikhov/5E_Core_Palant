# Languages

  
Fluency is a much more complicated issue than a simple question of whether of not a character can speak a language. There are levels of fluency, ranging from barely understanding simple words to a total mastery of a tongue. Language fluency is broken into four levels - poor, fair, good, and mastery.

  
  


Having less than good fluency with a language places penalties on a characters efforts at social interaction and research. Similarly, total mastery of a language provides a bonus to social interaction with native speakers \(though not characters who have simply learned a language\) and research into works using that language. These penalties and bonuses are listed on the following page. They apply to all Charisma ability checks that require speech and to Research checks involving works written primarily in that language.

Some languages have a **dialect**. A character has one level less fluency in a dialect than he has in its core language \(for one Ip, he can increase fluency in the dialect\). Some languages have vulgate tongues based off them. A character with mastery in a language is considered to have Poor fluency in its vulgates, but has no point-break when buying up his fluency.

Characters **begin** play with fair fluency in their native tongue \(speech\), and a number of additional language points equal to their Int bonus.

**Secret**

Racial

**Regional**

In addition to Common, every character knows the regional human language of their homeland. Most people communicate using their regional language first, and then if there's no understanding, switch to common \(Faeruni\). Only the most isolated of places would not know their regional language, although there are races and cultures that don't have an understanding of Common. 

Dialects. 

The primary languages listed below each include a number of dialects. In official sources, many of these dialects are listed as languages in their own right, but in the campaign, these languages are considered dialects of larger, regional language families. Characters speaking different dialects can still communicate with one another, but there are phrases, vocabulary, and wording choices that make them sound different. Communicating with someone who speaks a different dialect is more, "You talk funny" versus "I can't understand you."

**Common** 

These languages are often spoken far-and-wide, though they often do not possess the nuance to discuss truly in-depth topics and philosophies.
