<p>Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute</p>
<p>You can tell if an area contains magical portals. If you study an area for 1 round, you know the sizes and locations of any portals in the area. Once you find a portal, you can study it. <span><span class="MathJax_Preview">If you find more than one portal, you can only study one at a time</span><script type="math/tex">If you find more than one portal, you can only study one at a time</script></span>.</p>
<p>Each round you study a portal, you discover one property of the portal, making an ability check using your spellcasting ability against a DC 17. If successful, you gain learn one property, in this order. If a given property does not apply to a portal, skip to the next applicable topic.</p>
<p>Any key or command word needed to activate the portal.</p>
<p>Special circumstances governing the use of the portal.</p>
<p>Whether the portal is one-way or two-way.</p>

<p>This spell interacts in different ways with variant types of portals, as follows:</p>
<p>Random portals are revealed only as random, and whether it can be activated now. It does not reveal when the portal starts or stops functioning.</p>
<p>Variable portals are revealed only as variable. If you study the portal&rsquo;s destination, the spell reveals only the destination to which the portal is currently set.</p>
<p>Creature-only portals are revealed as such. If you study the portal&rsquo;s destination, the spell reveals where the portal sends creatures. If it is the type of portal that sends creature one place and their equipment another place, the spell does not reveal where the equipment goes.</p>
<p>Malfunctioning portals are revealed as such, without detailing what sort of malfunction it produces.</p>

<p>Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute</p>
<p>You create a shimmering prismatic blade of needle width and magical sharpness. This weapon functions as a sword of sharpness <span><span class="MathJax_Preview">including the light-shedding abilities</span><script type="math/tex">including the light-shedding abilities</script></span>, with a rapier&rsquo;s basic stats, and uses your spell attack bonus. While this spell is active, you are immune to color spray. If you are the target of a prismatic spray while using this spell, you may elect to sacrifice the chromatic blade, causing it to end in exchange for immunity to the effects of the prismatic spray. The blade can only be destroyed by a dispel magic, disintegrate, or a properly worded limited wish.</p>
<p>Cone of Teeth</p>
<p>3<sup>rd</sup>-level evocation</p>
<p>Casting time: 1 action</p>

<p>Components: V, M <span><span class="MathJax_Preview">a shark’s tooth</span><script type="math/tex">a shark’s tooth</script></span></p>
<p>Duration: Instantaneous</p>
<p>You shape water into thin blades as sharp as a shark’s teeth and grind your enemies in your watery maw. The water extends in a 40-foot cone, dealing 8d6 slashing damage unless the target succeeds at a Constitution saving throw for half damage. The spell leaves a bit of water on the ground <span><span class="MathJax_Preview">and often blood too</span><script type="math/tex">and often blood too</script></span>, and extinguishes candles and other small flames. When used against fire elementals or other creatures that take damage from water, the spell deals additional damage equal to your spellcasting modifier.</p>
<p>At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4<sup>th</sup> level or higher, the damage in- creases by 1d6 for each slot level above 3<sup>rd</sup>.</p>
<p>Create Shade</p>
<p>7<sup>th</sup>-level transmutation</p>
<p>Casting time: 1 action</p>
<p>Range: 120 feet</p>
<p>Components: V, S</p>
<p>Duration: 12 hours</p>
<p>You transform one patch of natural ground <span><span class="MathJax_Preview">e.g. a beach or park, not city streets or the deck of a ship</span><script type="math/tex">e.g. a beach or park, not city streets or the deck of a ship</script></span> into a shaded area. The patch may be any shape as long as it fits within a 100-foot by 100-foot cube. There is no obvious source of the shade, but the temperature in the area is cool and the light is not otherwise dimmed. Those in the area do not suffer from ill effects of the sun <span><span class="MathJax_Preview">whether dehydration, sun-light sensitivity, or effects of excessive heat caused by sun exposure</span><script type="math/tex">whether dehydration, sun-light sensitivity, or effects of excessive heat caused by sun exposure</script></span>. Any creature taking a short rest in your shade recovers from one level of exhaustion caused by heat or the sun, while a creature taking a long rest in your shade recovers from all levels of exhaustion that were caused by heat or the sun.</p>
<p>At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using an 8<sup>th</sup> level spell slot, the duration increases to one week. When you cast this spell using a 9<sup>th</sup> level spell slot, the duration increases to one month.</p>
<p>Create Soundstaff</p>
<p>7<sup>th</sup>-level transmutation</p>
<p>Casting time: 10 minutes</p>
<p>Range: Touch</p>
<p>Components: V, S, M <span><span class="MathJax_Preview">a dark wooden staff with a blue stone at its tip worth 300gp</span><script type="math/tex">a dark wooden staff with a blue stone at its tip worth 300gp</script></span></p>
<p>Duration: 60 days</p>
<p>You fix a staff into the ground, which absorbs ambient noise within 300 feet. This creates an area of tranquility surrounding the staff for up to 60 days. All thunder attacks within 300 feet of the staff are made with disadvantage and saving throws against thunder are made with advantage; all creatures within 300 feet of the staff resist thunder damage. The spell ceases to function if the staff is moved before the 30<sup>th</sup> day. If the staff is removed after the 30<sup>th</sup> day, it functions as a limited staff of thunder and lightning, except it can only produce one thunder or thunderclap effect for each full 10 days that it was in place before the staff loses its potency. The staff ceases to have any magic after the 60<sup>th</sup> day.</p>
<p>Detect Life</p>
<p>1<sup>st</sup>-level divination <span><span class="MathJax_Preview">ritual</span><script type="math/tex">ritual</script></span></p>
<p>Casting Time: 1 action</p>
<p>Range: Self</p>
<p>Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes</p>
<p>For the duration, you detect the presence of intelligent, living creatures within 30 feet of you, and such creatures cannot become hidden from you. You can tell if each creature is aware, but not exactly what the life is. It also does not give exact numbers - merely an indication of life and sentience in a general direction relative to the caster.</p>
<p>Detect Metals and Minerals</p>
<p>1<sup>st</sup>-level divination <span><span class="MathJax_Preview">ritual</span><script type="math/tex">ritual</script></span></p>
<p>Casting Time: 1 action</p>
<p>Range: Self</p>
<p>Components: V, S, M <span><span class="MathJax_Preview">a bit of the material sought</span><script type="math/tex">a bit of the material sought</script></span></p>
<p>Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes</p>
<p>For the duration, you can sense the presence and location of a single type of ore or mineral deposit within 30 feet of you. The spell can penetrate most barriers, but it is blocked by 3 feet of wood.</p>
<p>Dimensional Lock</p>
<p>8<sup>th</sup>-level abjuration</p>
<p>Casting Time: 1 action</p>
<p>Range: 120 ft.</p>
<p>Components: V, S</p>
<p>Duration: 10 days</p>
<p>A target point within range is the center of a 15&rsquo; radius effect for the duration of the spell. Extradimensional travel within this area is completely barred, preventing passage into other planes <span><span class="MathJax_Preview">including the astral and ethereal</span><script type="math/tex">including the astral and ethereal</script></span>, all teleportation magics, phasing, and similar abilities.</p>
<p>The dimensional lock does not interfere with the movement of creatures already in ethereal or astral forms, nor does it block extradimensional perception. It also does not prevent summoned creatures from returning to their home planes at the end of a summoning spell, but it does prevent creatures from being summoned from other planes within it.</p>
<p>Disguise Undead</p>
<p>2<sup>nd</sup> level illusion</p>
<p>Casting Time: 1 action</p>
<p>Range: Touch</p>
<p>Components: V, S, M <span><span class="MathJax_Preview">cocoon of a death's head moth</span><script type="math/tex">cocoon of a death's head moth</script></span></p>
<p>Duration: 1 hour</p>
<p>You make one mindless or willing corporeal undead look different, including clothing, armor, weapons, and equipment. You can make it seem one foot shorter or taller, and anywhere between very thin or very fat. You cannot change the creature&rsquo;s body type, however: bipedal creatures retain that form. Otherwise, the extent of the change is entirely up to you. This spell can alter how the creature in question smells, as well, allowing even rotting undead to be disguised by it - although the spell does only work in the moment, so that a putrescent undead disguised by it will fool viewers in the moment, but may leave the stench of death in its wake.</p>
<p>The changes wrought by the spell fail to hold up to physical inspection. For example, if you use this spell to add a hat to the undead creature, objects pass through the hat, and anyone who touches it would feel only the creature&rsquo;s true form beneath. To discern that the undead is disguised, a creature can use its action to inspect its appearance and must succeed on an Intelligence <span><span class="MathJax_Preview">Investigation</span><script type="math/tex">Investigation</script></span> check against your spell save DC.</p>
<p>Dunragarr&rsquo;s Steelstone</p>
<p>1<sup>st</sup>-level transmutation</p>
<p>Casting Time: 1 action</p>
<p>Range: Touch</p>
<p>Duration: 1 hour</p>
<p>You touch an item made of steel or iron, and it transforms into a strange amalgamation of stone and steel with a gout of <span><span class="MathJax_Preview">non-damaging</span><script type="math/tex">non-damaging</script></span> steam. This can transform items no heavier than 15lbs in weight. This transformation has the following effects:</p>
<p>Weapons inflict +1 damage.</p>
<p>Armor reduces all damage taken by 1 point <span><span class="MathJax_Preview">to a minimum of 1</span><script type="math/tex">to a minimum of 1</script></span>.</p>
<p>Metal barriers and objects inflict disadvantage to attempts to force, damage or destroy them.</p>
<p>At Higher Level: For each additional spell level above 1<sup>st</sup> used to cast this spell, add another 15lbs of weight that may be so transformed.</p>
<p>Dweomerflow</p>
<p>4<sup>th</sup>-level transmutation</p>
<p>Casting Time: 1 action</p>
<p>Range: Touch</p>
<p>Components: V, S</p>
<p>Duration: 1 round</p>
<p>One of the works of Wyara of Mystra, dweomerflow is a work of meta-magic, creating a field of magic that encompasses another spell and shifts them into or out of a receptacle without permitting the spell to manifest normally. There are two forms of this spell, which the caster chooses to use when the spell is cast.</p>
<p>Fill Receptacle: With this version, the spell causes the next spell the target casts to flow from the caster into a prepared receptacle instead of taking its usual effect. Only receptacles innately prepared to accept a spell can be targeted by this effect. These include a focal stone, a magic item into which spells can be stored, or other myriad items, such as crucibles empowered to accept enchantments, certain artifacts, and the like. If the magic item is one that can already accept spells <span><span class="MathJax_Preview">such as a ring of spell storing</span><script type="math/tex">such as a ring of spell storing</script></span>, the spell level limit of the item becomes equal to the level at which dweomerflow is cast instead of its normal limits. This function can also be used with effects such as glyph of warding; in that case, the subsequent spell cast is imbued into the glyph as a secondary magical effect that is triggered at the same time as its main effect.</p>
<p>Charge Transference: With this version, the caster may alter the charges contained by magic items that use them, such as wands. It functions as the Fill Receptacle effect above, but the spell that is cast into the item must be one of the spells that item can cast, and it regains a number of charges equal to the cost of casting that charge for the item. Alternately, it can be used to siphon charges from one item to another, transferring up to one charge per level of spell slot used in casting dweomerflow. Excess charges are wasted, and an item that is reduced to 0 charges has its normal effect. If one or both of these items are in the possession of an unwilling owner, that owner is permitted an Intelligence save to totally negate the effect.</p>
<p>At Higher Levels: When this spell is cast using a spell slot of 5<sup>th</sup> or higher, increase the possible spell levels of the effects noted above.</p>
<p>Examine the Weft</p>
<p>2<sup>nd</sup>-level divination <span><span class="MathJax_Preview">ritual</span><script type="math/tex">ritual</script></span></p>
<p>Casting Time: Swift, or Reaction</p>

<p>Duration: Instantaneous</p>
<p>You immediately peruse a spell as it is being cast <span><span class="MathJax_Preview">as a Reaction</span><script type="math/tex">as a Reaction</script></span>, is currently in effect <span><span class="MathJax_Preview">if it has no visible effects, you must study it while using detect magic</span><script type="math/tex">if it has no visible effects, you must study it while using detect magic</script></span> or that is in written form before you. You tap into the Weave to discern the pattern of that magic, and then fill your mind with its weft. As long as you are able to prepare a spell of that level, you prepare the studied spell; if necessary, you lose a spell you already have prepared in order to make room for the new one. As long as you retain the prepared spell, you may scribe it or cast it as normal.</p>
<p>If the spell is too high in level for you to cast, you take 1d6 radiant damage per spell level above your ability from the attempt to read and incorporate something of spell power too great for you to manage.</p>

<p>Fiery Fists</p>
<p>3<sup>rd</sup>-level transmutation</p>
<p>Casting Time: 1 bonus action</p>
<p>Range: Self</p>
<p>Components: V, S, M <span><span class="MathJax_Preview">a lump of coal</span><script type="math/tex">a lump of coal</script></span></p>
<p>Duration: 1 minute</p>
<p>Your hands burst into flames that emit noxious smoke and shed light as torches. While the spell is active, you may use your action to make a melee spell attack against one adjacent creature. Creatures hit by your touch take 4d6 fire damage and must make a Constitution saving throw against your spell- casting DC or be poisoned until the end of your next turn.</p>
<p>At Higher Levels. When you cast the spell using a slot of 5<sup>th</sup> level or higher, you may make two at- tacks when you use your action to make a melee spell attack with your fiery fists.</p>
<p>Fire Burst</p>
<p>1<sup>st</sup>-level transmutation</p>
<p>Casting Time: 1 bonus action</p>
<p>Range: 30 feet</p>
<p>Components: V, S</p>
<p>Duration: Instantaneous</p>
<p>You make a non-magical flame <span><span class="MathJax_Preview">equivalent to a can- dle, torch or campfire</span><script type="math/tex">equivalent to a can- dle, torch or campfire</script></span> erupt in an arrow, firing at a creature within 5 feet before extinguishing itself. You extinguish the target flame and the creature must make a Dexterity saving throw. If your target was a candle, the creature takes 2d4 damage on a failed saving throw. If your target was a torch, the creature takes 2d6 damage on a failed saving throw. If your target was a campfire <span><span class="MathJax_Preview">up to a 5-foot cube of flame</span><script type="math/tex">up to a 5-foot cube of flame</script></span>, the creature takes 2d8 damage on a failed saving throw.</p>
<p>At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2<sup>nd</sup> level or higher, the target takes an additional die of damage for each slot level above 1<sup>st</sup>.</p>
<p>Flameproof</p>
<p>6<sup>th</sup>-level abjuration</p>
<p>Casting Time: 1 action</p>
<p>Range: Touch</p>
<p>Components: V, S, M <span><span class="MathJax_Preview">a bit of wax</span><script type="math/tex">a bit of wax</script></span></p>
<p>Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour</p>
<p>You touch a creature or item and imbue them with the strength to withstand any flame. The target is immune to fire damage and is not affected by any deleterious effects caused by fire, heat, or the sun.</p>
<p>Flying Blade</p>
<p>Transmutation cantrip</p>
<p>Casting Time: 1 bonus action</p>
<p>Range: Touch</p>
<p>Components: V, S, M <span><span class="MathJax_Preview">a dagger</span><script type="math/tex">a dagger</script></span></p>
<p>Duration: 1 minute</p>
<p>You toss a dagger into the air and it is borne aloft by the winds. For the duration of the spell, the dagger hovers and you may use your action to make a ranged weapon attack with the dagger against a target creature or object within 60 feet of you. When you do so, you may use your spellcasting ability in place of your Strength or Dexterity for the attack and damage roll.</p>
<p>As you increase in level, this spell can animate additional daggers, and make attacks with them simultaneously. It can animate two daggers at 5<sup>th</sup> level, three at 11<sup>th</sup> level, and 4 at 17<sup>th</sup> level.</p>
<p>Gate Seal</p>
<p>6<sup>th</sup>-level abjuration <span><span class="MathJax_Preview">ritual</span><script type="math/tex">ritual</script></span></p>
<p>Casting Time: 1 action</p>
<p>Range: 30 ft.</p>
<p>Components: V, S, M <span><span class="MathJax_Preview">a silver bar with 50gp</span><script type="math/tex">a silver bar with 50gp</script></span></p>
<p>Duration: Permanent</p>
<p>You permanently seal a gate or portal you designate within range as part of the casting. This prevents any activation of the gate or portal, although the gate seal remains as a magical effect around the gate or portal, and is subject to effects such as dispel magic. A knock does not function on a gate seal, though a chime of opening does.</p>
<p>Gembolt</p>
<p>3<sup>rd</sup>-level evocation</p>
<p>Casting Time: 1 action</p>
<p>Range: 200 feet</p>
<p>Duration: Instantaneous</p>
<p>Holding aloft a gemstone, you map tap into the power locked within it, causing it to streak forth in the form of a bolt of energy that shimmers with the same hue as the stone itself, striking a single target in range. This inflicts six dice worth of damage, with the specific die type being based on the quality of the gem: ornamental gems inflict d4s of damage, semiprecious inflict d6s of damage, and precious stones inflict d8s.</p>
<p>This does not consume the gemstone, although you may choose to do so in the casting. In such case, the damage is d6s for ornamental stones, d8s for semiprecious and d10s for precious. All that remains of the stone after the casting is simple, inert grey dust of half the volume of the original stone.</p>
<p>At Higher Level: For each level of spell above 3<sup>rd</sup> used to cast this spell, increase the damage by one additional die.</p>
<p>Material Component: A gemstone of ornamental, semiprecious or precious quality. This does not usually consume the stone, but you may choose to have the casting of the spell do so in order to inflict additional damage.</p>
<p>Glyph of Revealing</p>
<p>2<sup>nd</sup>-level evocation <span><span class="MathJax_Preview">ritual</span><script type="math/tex">ritual</script></span></p>
<p>Casting Time: 1 action</p>
<p>Range: Touch</p>
<p>Duration: 1 hour</p>
<p>You write a glyph upon any surface that will retain the ink necessary to cast the spell, even for just a few seconds. When it is complete, the glyph glows for a moment and then sends out a wave of white light 120&rsquo; in every direction and then vanishes. When the wave of light touches anything magical, it begins to glow with a white radiance the same brightness as faerie fire. The outlines of magically hidden inscriptions or magical writing of any kind is immediately revealed. This allows them to be read without triggering their effects.</p>
<p>Material Components: An ink made of the juiced of crushed eyebright, white chalk and crushed quartz.</p>
<p>Gods Granted: Any god that can grant the Knowledge or Logos Domains.</p>
<p>Hailcone</p>

<p>Duration: x</p>
<p>The spellcaster causes large hailstones <span><span class="MathJax_Preview">2 inches across and greater</span><script type="math/tex">2 inches across and greater</script></span> to rain down in an cylindrical area 30 feet across and 30 feet high. As the magically conductive hailstones fall, they spark with lighting that leaps from stone to stone in a torrent, filling the area with a web of blue-white burning threads and the smell of ozone. Creatures in the area of effect take 6d6 points of lightning and bludgeoning damage and are knocked prone. A Strength save prevents being knocked prone, and reduces the damage to half.</p>
<p>At Higher Levels: When this spell is cast using a spell slot of 5<sup>th</sup> level or higher, add 1d6 damage to the damage for each spell slot above 4<sup>th</sup>.</p>
<p>Holy Star</p>
<p>7<sup>th</sup>-level abjuration</p>
<p>Casting Time: 1 action</p>
<p>Range: Self</p>
<p>Components: V, S</p>
<p>Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute</p>
<p>You create a gleaming magical construct about the size of a dinner plate in the shape of a star. It stays near your shoulder, providing light out to 20&rsquo;, and dim light for a further 20&rsquo;. This star has the following three functions, and you can designate which function to activate as a free action on your turn.</p>
<p>Protection. You gain a +3 AC bonus from the holy star, which swerves to intercept attacks against you.</p>
<p>Starbolt. As an action, you may cause the holy star to fire a bolt of searing white-blue stellar fire at a target within 90 feet. This attack uses your spell attack bonus, and inflicts 8d6 radiant and lightning damage <span><span class="MathJax_Preview">creatures must be resistant or immune to both to apply such defenses</span><script type="math/tex">creatures must be resistant or immune to both to apply such defenses</script></span>.</p>
<p>Spell Reflection. As a reaction, you can cause the holy star to reflect back a spell directed at you or that includes you in its area of effect. The holy star may reflect up to six levels worth of spells; as a spell is reflected, the level of that spell is subtracted from the remaining levels worth of spell turning available. When a spell is reflected, its target is simply moved to the originator of the spell - all other effects are as though the original caster were still its caster. If there are not enough levels left to reflect a spell, they may still be expended to instead counter it, as though by a counterspell cast at a level equal to the number of spell levels available. If the last spell level of a holy star&rsquo;s spell reflection is used, the spell ends early.</p>

<p>Invigorate</p>
<p>1<sup>st</sup>-level evocation</p>
<p>Casting Time: 1 action</p>
<p>Range: Touch</p>
<p>Duration: Instantaneous</p>
<p>You touch the target of the spell, refreshing it and undoing the effects of weariness. The creature&rsquo;s Exhaustion Level drops by one.</p>
<p>At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2<sup>nd</sup> level or higher, it reduces Exhaustion Level by another step for each level above 1<sup>st</sup>.</p>
<p>Irithra&rsquo;s Spelltouch</p>
<p>2<sup>nd</sup>-level enchantment</p>
<p>Casting Time: 10 minutes</p>
<p>Range: Touch</p>
<p>Duration: 1 hour, or until discharged</p>
<p>You cast this spell on a non-living item. Another spell is then cast &ldquo;into&rdquo; that item on the subsequent round - you do not have to be the caster of the second. This second spell is then &ldquo;stored&rdquo; in the item, awaiting touch by a trigger creature.</p>
<p>You determine the trigger creature when you create this spell: it can be race and/or sex, or by &ldquo;type&rdquo; <span><span class="MathJax_Preview">undead, etc</span><script type="math/tex">undead, etc</script></span>. When the trigger creature touches the item, the stored spell is unleashed, taking immediate effect as though cast by the one who cast that spell into the item.</p>
<p>This second spell cannot be directed <span><span class="MathJax_Preview">i.e., it must work without choosing a specific target</span><script type="math/tex">i.e., it must work without choosing a specific target</script></span>, and the item is ground zero for any spell effect. Neither you nor the caster of the second spell can trigger the stored spell, even if you meet the requirements for the trigger. Someone may throw the item to strike a target, making a normal Dexterity attack roll to do so. If the item hits a creature that is its trigger, the magic is unleashed.</p>
<p>The spelltouch item radiates magic faintly, and identifying magics never reveal more than the fact that this item has &ldquo;a single to-be-triggered magic stored by another, underlying enchantment&rdquo;. If the spelltouched item is shattered or more than half of it is broken away, the stored spell is lost, silently and harmlessly dissipating. This also occurs if the spelltouched item comes within the area of effect of a dispel magic effect, or within 10 feet of any other spelltouched item.</p>
<p>Higher Levels: For each spell level beyond 2<sup>nd</sup> level this spell is cast at, double the duration <span><span class="MathJax_Preview">so 2 hours at 3rd level, 4 hours at 4th, etc</span><script type="math/tex">so 2 hours at 3rd level, 4 hours at 4th, etc</script></span>.</p>

<p>Components: V, M <span><span class="MathJax_Preview">a bent tube of nickel costing 100gp</span><script type="math/tex">a bent tube of nickel costing 100gp</script></span></p>
<p>Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes</p>
<p>You can burrow through nonmagical, unworked earth and stone at your normal speed. While burrow- ing, you cannot be tracked except by magical means nor can any creatures follow you; you do not disturb the sand or earth that you burrow through. If you have not ceased to burrow when the spell ends, you are forcibly ejected to nearest inhabitable space and take 5d4 damage.</p>
<p>At Higher Levels. If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5<sup>th</sup> level or higher, you can target one additional creature that you can touch per spell slot level above 4<sup>th</sup>.</p>

<p>Components: V, S, M <span><span class="MathJax_Preview">braided copper wire</span><script type="math/tex">braided copper wire</script></span></p>
<p>Duration: Until discharged, or 1 day</p>
<p>This spell forces magical lightning to a specific spot imbued with this spell. When cast, the wizard touches the material component to the target object, which cannot be animate, living, or magical, nor can it weight more than 100 pounds. When any part of a ranged magical attack of 3<sup>rd</sup> level or lower that inflicts lightning damage passes within 150 feet of the item thus imbued, the attack is diverted away and pulled into the item imbued with lightning rod.</p>
<p>If someone is in contact with the item affected by lightning rod, that person receives the full damage of the attack; if the attack normally permits a Dexterity saving throw, it instead becomes a Constitution saving throw that is made at disadvantage. Though nominally a defensive spell used to ground out lightning attacks by an enemy, Rogaster was also fond of using this spell offensively, imbuing an enemy&rsquo;s breastplate or weapon.</p>
<p>At Higher Levels: When this spell is cast using a spell slot of 3<sup>rd</sup> level or higher, increase the level of the spell the lightning rod may coopt by two levels for each spell slot level above the 2<sup>nd</sup>. Thus, a 3<sup>rd</sup> level spell slot may ground out up to a 5<sup>th</sup> level spell, a 4<sup>th</sup> level spell slot may ground out up to a 7<sup>th</sup> level spell, and a 5<sup>th</sup> level spell slot may ground out up to a 9<sup>th</sup> level spell.</p>
<p>Mantle of Mystra</p>
<p>4<sup>th</sup>-level abjuration</p>
<p>Casting Time: 10 minutes</p>
<p>Range: Self</p>
<p>Duration: 1 year, or until discharged</p>
<p>The spell creative an invisible protective aura around you. Choose any spell that you have cast, felt the effects of or observed cast, or a spell that you know the specific name of, of any level equal to or lower than the spell slot level used to cast this spell. The first time you are struck by this spell, the mantle of Mystra absorbs it perfectly, negating its effects and then rechannels it into an immediate casting of another spell that you know how to cast and sends that spell back at the original caster. The spell that is sent against the target must be equal to or lower in level than the one it absorbed. Both of these spell selections must be made when the mantle of Mystra is cast.</p>
<p>Higher Level: This spell may be cast at higher levels in order to absorb and reflect spells of higher than 4<sup>th</sup> level.</p>
<p>Gods Granted: Mystra, Azuth</p>

<p>Casting Time: 1 action</p>
<p>Range: Touch</p>
<p>Duration: 1 year</p>
<p>You weave a complicated illusion over a stone surface. The illusion is simply that of any kind of solid, unbroken stone surface, hiding any seams, carvings or even openings. The stone created by the illusion blends perfectly with the surrounding stone in appearance.</p>
<p>Anyone with reason to doubt the veracity of the illusion may make a Wisdom save to pierce it <span><span class="MathJax_Preview">dwarves, gnomes and other subterranean denizens gain advantage on this save</span><script type="math/tex">dwarves, gnomes and other subterranean denizens gain advantage on this save</script></span>. The illusion is visual-only, and touching it can reveal any details concealed by the spell that could be sensed by touch, also granting advantage on the save.</p>
<p>At Higher Level: Casting this spell at higher spell levels increases the duration to 5 years at 3<sup>rd</sup> level, a decade at 4<sup>th</sup>, twenty years at 5<sup>th</sup> and a full century at 6<sup>th</sup>. Each spell level after that adds an additional century to the duration.</p>
<p>Gods Granted: Any god in the dwarven or gnomish pantheons.</p>
<p>Mind Mantle</p>
<p>2<sup>nd</sup>-level abjuration</p>
<p>Casting Time: 1 action</p>
<p>Range: Touch</p>
<p>Duration: 1 hour</p>
<p>You create a cloaking web of random mental impulses that screens the mind of the one protected by the spell. All mind-reading and influencing spells of 4<sup>th</sup> level or less are useless against the one thus protected, as are magic items or other powers that mimic those effects. The caster may end it by silent act of will.</p>
<p>Higher Levels: For every level above 2<sup>nd</sup> this spell is cast at, it lasts one additional hour.</p>
<p>Poisonstar</p>
<p>2<sup>nd</sup>-level evocation</p>
<p>Casting Time: 1 action</p>
<p>Range: Self</p>
<p>Components: V,S</p>
<p>Duration: 1 minute or until stars are discharged</p>
<p>This spell creates six vivid purple winking stars around one of your hands. At any time within the duration, you may cause a number of these stars to race after a target of your choice, deploying either a number equal to your Intelligence bonus as a standard action, or a single star as a bonus action. Targets may make a Dexterity saving throw to resist being struck; success on this save causes the star to also wink out of existence. This save is at disadvantage if the target is attacked with a number of stars equal to or greater than the target&rsquo;s Dexterity bonus.</p>
<p>A living creature struck by one of these stars takes 1 point of poison damage, or 2 points if the creature is undead. Living creatures must also make a Constitution save or become Intoxicated for one minute <span><span class="MathJax_Preview">though at the end of each of their rounds, they may attempt to throw off the remaining effects with another Constitution save</span><script type="math/tex">though at the end of each of their rounds, they may attempt to throw off the remaining effects with another Constitution save</script></span>.</p>
<p>Higher Levels: For every level above 2<sup>nd</sup> this spell is cast at, it creates three additional stars. Increasing numbers of these stars limn the caster&rsquo;s arm and course up around the head like a vivid purple halo.</p>
<p>Portal Well</p>
<p>2<sup>nd</sup>-level transmutation</p>
<p>Casting Time: 1 action</p>
<p>Range: Touch</p>
<p>Components: V, S, M <span><span class="MathJax_Preview">silver wire tied into a knot</span><script type="math/tex">silver wire tied into a knot</script></span></p>
<p>Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes</p>
<p>You alter the operation of a portal you target with this spell. Upon entering it, accompanied by up to five others, you are transported into an extradimensional pocket instead of the other side of the portal. This only functions on a portal which you can use.</p>
<p>The extradimensional space created by this spell is similar to that created by rope trick. While within it, you can see both ends of the portal, although it is murky and indistinct, as viewed through a fog. When the spell ends, you exit the space at either end of the portal, according to your choice.</p>
<p>A successful dispel magic or other magic that inhibits the functioning of the portal traps you in the space for the duration of that effect, although creatures within the space may make an Intelligence save at the casting of the spell to be ejected from their choice of portal end to avoid being so trapped. Any effects that destroy the portal ejects all creatures within from a random end of the portal, inflicting 5d6 points of force damage to them; each creature is ejected out of a different end of the portal.</p>
<p>At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3<sup>rd</sup> level or higher, you increase the duration of spell. It becomes &ldquo;Concentration, up to 30 minutes&rdquo; at 3<sup>rd</sup> level, and &ldquo;Concentration, up to 1 hour&rdquo; at 4<sup>th</sup> level. At 5<sup>th</sup> level, the Concentration component ends, the duration simply becoming &ldquo;1 hour&rdquo;, and then doubling for each spell slot level above 5<sup>th</sup>.</p>
<p>Protection from Missiles</p>

<p>Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute</p>
<p>The touched target of this spell gains resistance to bludgeoning, slashing, and piercing damage that derives from non-magical ranged weapons.</p>

<p>An undead creature you touch regains a number of hit points equal to 1d6+your spellcasting ability modifier.</p>
<p>At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2<sup>nd</sup> level or higher, the healing increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 1<sup>st</sup>.</p>
<p>Gods Granted: Any gods that grant the Death or Grave Domains.</p>
<p>Rockburst</p>
<p>2<sup>nd</sup>-level transmutation</p>
<p>Casting Time: 1 action</p>
<p>Range: 60 feet</p>
<p>Duration: Instantaneous</p>
<p>You cause a selection of stone to suddenly explode in all directions, spraying jagged stone shrapnel in a 20&rsquo; radius of it. Damage inflicted is based on how much stone is destroyed by the casting: for each 1 cubic foot of rock, it inflicts 1d4+1 die of piercing damage. The spell may destroy up to four cubic feet of rock, giving it a maximum damage of 4d4+4 piercing damage, but only if sufficient stone exists to be affected.</p>
<p>This spell destroys the structural integrity of the stone in question, and so can do damage to structures, caverns and the like as well. If intending to inflict such damage towards a specific purpose, you must make a successful Intelligence check with a DC determined by your DM, based on how difficult your goal is.</p>
<p>At Higher Level: For each spell level above the 2<sup>nd</sup> used to cast this spell, you may affect one additional cubic foot of stone.</p>
<p>Rune of Power</p>
<p>1<sup>st</sup>-level evocation</p>
<p>Casting Time: 1 action</p>
<p>Range: Touch</p>
<p>Duration: 1 day</p>
<p>You touch a surface of stone or metal, leaving behind a dwarven rune-sigil. You may cause the rune to discharge on the round following its creation, or it may &ldquo;wait&rdquo; for a trigger. The baseline rune triggers when a living or undead creature moves within five feet of it, though you may give it exceptions to this. You determine the situations under which the rune does not discharge its power, establishing a number of these exemptions equal to three plus your proficiency bonus. A rune disappears once its duration has passed, or once it is discharged.</p>
<p>The effects of this rune is based on what specific rune is wrought through its use. When learned, you know how to create a Basic rune. Research and discovery can reveal other such runes of power.</p>
<p>Basic <span><span class="MathJax_Preview">1st level</span><script type="math/tex">1st level</script></span>: If not employing one of the known runes of dwarfkind, you can create a runic symbol that communicates a simple concept to anyone who sees it.

<p>Material Component: Casting a rune of power requires the sacrifice of a gemstone of some quality. Ornamental gemstones are required for effects of up to 3<sup>rd</sup> level, and semiprecious for higher levels than that. There are thought to be runes or techniques for casting a rune of power with precious stones that may imbue them with greater power or even permanency, but those secrets may be lost.</p>

<p>Choose a point within range that has a number of small, unsecured objects - rocks, marbles, dinnerware, caltrops and the like. There is a sudden flash from the center of those objects, which go flying in all directions, literally rebounding back into the field when they hit the edge of the spell&rsquo;s effect, filling it with flying projectiles. Each creature <span><span class="MathJax_Preview">other than the caster himself</span><script type="math/tex">other than the caster himself</script></span> in a 10-foot-radius cloud centered on that spot must make a Dexterity saving throw or take 1d4 bludgeoning damage. Spellcasters caught in the area must make a Constitution save for suffering from severe distractions.

<p>Material Component: The material components of the spell are the items themselves and a flint and steel or tinderbox.</p>

<p>Duration: Instantaneous</p>
<p>A darting streak of lightning flashes from your pointing finger to a point you choose within range and then rapidly expands in all directions into a sphere of arcing blue-white electrical bolts. Each creature in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make a Dexterity saving throw. A target takes 8d6 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The electricity spreads around corners.</p>
<p>At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4<sup>th</sup> level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 3<sup>rd</sup>.</p>

<p>3<sup>rd</sup>-level illusion</p>
<p>Casting Time: 1 action</p>
<p>Range: 90 ft</p>
<p>Components: V, S</p>
<p>Duration: 1 round</p>
<p>You select a target within the spell&rsquo;s range. This target suddenly perceives a small mote of darkness that quickly grows larger, appearing as though it were coming from some far distance behind you. It rushes in with a frightening moaning sound and rushing of air during the round in which it is cast. It does not strike the target until the end of the target&rsquo;s next turn. Like a magic missile, this projectile strikes unerringly, even following the target around corners.</p>
<p>When this spell is cast, the target is permitted a Wisdom save against your spell save DC. If the target fails this save, the target believes that the attack has come from somewhere else, and receives 5d8 psychic damage when struck, and falls prone. If the save is successful, the target takes half damage and comprehends the true source of the spell.</p>
<p>At Higher Levels.&rsquo; When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4<sup>th</sup> level or higher, its damage is increased by 1d8 ft for every level above the 3<sup>rd</sup>.</p>

<p>Components: V, S, M <span><span class="MathJax_Preview">piece of bone</span><script type="math/tex">piece of bone</script></span></p>
<p>Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute</p>
<p>You create a small cluster of three skeletons that are semi-real phantasms. They can be of any appearance you wish for them, though they always appear as skeletal humanoids. They cannot be turned, and though they appear solid, they are not. As a bonus action, you can impel any number of your skeletons to attack a target. This attack uses your spell attack bonus, and if successful causes the skeleton to pass through the target, inflicting 2d6 necrotic damage. Additionally, a target must make a Constitution save against your spell DC or take the Stunned Condition until the end of its next turn.</p>
<p>The skeletons have an AC 14, and though they do not take damage, any successful attack against them forces the caster to make a concentration check to avoid the spell being disrupted. If this damage is radiant, the concentration check is made at disadvantage.</p>
<p>Snilloc&rsquo;s Snowball</p>

<p>Spell Phylactery</p>
<p>5<sup>th</sup>-level transmutation</p>
<p>Casting Time: 10 minutes</p>
<p>Range: Touch</p>
<p>Components: V, S</p>
<p>Duration: Permanent until triggered or wears away</p>
<p>You imbue a spell scroll with a set of conditions that will trigger the casting of that spell scroll automatically. The spell on the scroll must be one that affects your person, and cannot be higher than 2<sup>nd</sup> level.</p>
<p>The conditions that trigger the spell must be clear, although they can be as specific or general as the caster wishes. Only phenomenon which the caster can perceive are viable triggering phenomenon, even if the caster is not aware of them at the time of triggering.</p>
<p>These scrolls must be worn around the head or wrists, often by creating small boxes or folded cloth around the paper scroll proper. As such, you can only wear up to three such phylacteries, and you of course may not be wearing other items at head and wrists. This spell remains in place for up to 24 hours after the phylactery is removed; if it is not put back on before then, the magic dissipates.</p>
<p>At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6<sup>th</sup> level or higher, increase the level of the spell that can be on the scroll to 3<sup>rd</sup> level with a 6<sup>th</sup> level spell slot, and one more level for every other level of spell slot thereafter <span><span class="MathJax_Preview">so 3rd for a 6th level spell slot, 4th for a 7th level spell slot, and 5th for a 9th level spell slot</span><script type="math/tex">so 3rd for a 6th level spell slot, 4th for a 7th level spell slot, and 5th for a 9th level spell slot</script></span>.</p>

<p>Spell Shield</p>
<p>3<sup>rd</sup>-level abjuration</p>
<p>Casting Time: 1 action</p>
<p>Range: Touch</p>
<p>Components: V, S</p>
<p>Duration: 1 minute</p>
<p>This spell protects the target of the spell from all magic in the following ways:</p>
<p>Target gains advantage on saves against all spells;</p>
<p>Target is immune to all illusion and enchantment spells of 2<sup>nd</sup> level or lower</p>
<p>The shield generates a pool of 25 points of damage. Half of all magical damage is taken by the shield instead. The spell ends if this damage pool is depleted.</p>
<p>At Higher Levels. If this spell is cast using a higher level spell slot, the defended target is rendered immune to illusion and enchantment spells of the level below that for the duration of the protection, and the pool of absorbed damage is increased by 10 per level above 3<sup>rd</sup>.</p>
<p>Spellmantle</p>
<p>6<sup>th</sup>-level abjuration</p>
<p>Casting Time: 1 action</p>
<p>Range: Touch</p>
<p>Components: V, S</p>
<p>Duration: Concentration, up to 2 hours</p>
<p>You place a magical aura around the target of the spell, a single creature that must be touched as the spell is cast. As part of casting, you may designate any combination of warded or activated spells.</p>
<p>Warded spells are spells of 4<sup>th</sup> level or lower that you can prepare <span><span class="MathJax_Preview">wizards may choose any spell in their spell books, for instance</span><script type="math/tex">wizards may choose any spell in their spell books, for instance</script></span> that you wish to protect the target from. When the target of the spell is subject to one of the designated spells, the spellmantle absorbs the incoming spell&rsquo;s energy completely without any action.</p>
<p>Activated spells are spells of 4<sup>th</sup> level or lower that you currently know or have prepared that will be cast on the target when a warded spell of at least equal level is absorbed. This spell is cast on the target of the spell as a reaction, triggered by the absorption of a warded spell. Activated spells may even be spells with a Range of Self, allowing the subject of the spell to receive spells a caster couldn&rsquo;t normally cast on them. Warded spells cannot be used to trigger activated spells higher in level than the warded spell.</p>
<p>For example, Evendur casts spellmantle on Glim. He chooses fireball and lightning bolt as the warded spells, and blink and magic weapon as the activated spells. When Glim is targeted by a fireball or a lightning bolt, she may choose - as a reaction - to immediately be targeted by a casting of blink or magic weapon.</p>
<p>At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7<sup>th</sup> or higher level, gain one additional spell to your allotment of spells that can be designated as warded or activated spells for each spell level beyond the 6<sup>th</sup>.

<p>Stars of Mystra</p>
<p>4<sup>th</sup>-level conjuration</p>
<p>Casting Time: 1 action</p>
<p>Range: 60 ft.</p>
<p>Components: V, S</p>
<p>Duration: 1 hour</p>
<p>You create six twinkling stars that orbit your head like ioun stones, casting light in a 10&rsquo; radius, and dim light out another 10&rsquo;. Beginning on the turn you cast the spell, you can launch one star as a bonus action at a target you designate within range, making a spell attack roll to hit.</p>
<p>Each time a target is struck by a star, they must make a Charisma save at your spell save DC or lose a 4<sup>th</sup> level spell slot as if the target had used it to cast a spell. If the target has no 4<sup>th</sup>-level spell slots, they lose a spell slot of their next highest spell level. If they have no spell slots of 1<sup>st</sup> through 4<sup>th</sup> levels, the star instead inflicts 2d4 radiant damage and bursts in a distinctive way, communicating this fact to you.</p>

<p>Rather than constantly reverse engineer damaging evocations into the lightning magics he favored, Rogaster Stormson <span><span class="MathJax_Preview">considered "ingeniously lazy" by Wyara's margin notes</span><script type="math/tex">considered "ingeniously lazy" by Wyara's margin notes</script></span> developed this spell. When cast, it creates a field of unseen magic that transmutes the next spell cast by the caster which creates damaging magic. As that second spell is cast, it transmutes the damage type of the second spell to lightning, replacing whatever the original damage type is. This spell is explicitly exempt from the normal limitations around casting two non-cantrip spells in the same action. If the caster does not follow up the casting of this spell with another damaging spell, its effects end by the end of the next turn, the spell slot spent and the magic wasted.</p>
<p>Sunbolt</p>
<p>2<sup>nd</sup>-level evocation</p>
<p>Casting Time: 1 action</p>
<p>Range: 120 feet</p>
<p>Components: V, S</p>
<p>Duration: Instantaneous</p>
<p>A ray of burning sunlight springs from your hand. Make a ranged spell attack to hit your target. A creature struck by the bolt takes 3d8 radiant damage and must make a Dexterity save. On a failed save, the target is also blinded for 1 round. Creatures with sunlight-based limitations take double damage as though they possessed a Damage Vulnerability to radiant damage.</p>
<p>At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3<sup>rd</sup> level or higher, the duration of blindness is increased by 1 round for each slot level above 2<sup>nd</sup>.</p>
<p>Tasso&rsquo;s Shriek</p>
<p>1<sup>st</sup>-level illusion</p>
<p>Casting Time: 1 bonus action</p>
<p>Range: 60 yards</p>
<p>Components: V or S</p>
<p>Duration: Instant</p>
<p>This spell creates an audible sound centered anywhere within the spell&rsquo;s range. This limits on this spell&rsquo;s manifestation is that it must be a sound the caster is himself capable of making - all spoken voices will be those of the caster <span><span class="MathJax_Preview">although skilled vocal mimics can be very effective in this regard</span><script type="math/tex">although skilled vocal mimics can be very effective in this regard</script></span>. Targets distracted by these sounds are permitted an Intelligence save to not fall for the illusion. The spell is unusual, in that it can be cast with solely a vocal or somatic component, making it a favorite spell for those who are hidden or those who are tied up.</p>
<p>Teleport Object</p>
<p>3<sup>rd</sup>-level alteration</p>
<p>Casting Time: varies</p>
<p>Range: Touch</p>
<p>Components: V, S, M <span><span class="MathJax_Preview">a brass key</span><script type="math/tex">a brass key</script></span></p>
<p>Duration: Instant</p>
<p>This spell involves the magical teleportation of objects to a prepared receptacle for them. This spell is cast in one of three ways, depending on the purpose of the spell.</p>
<p>Prepare Receptacle. With this, the caster prepares a receptacle to hold items that he sends into it. It is, in effect, the creation of a &ldquo;landing pad&rdquo; for those items, and without at least one such receptacle, the other versions of the spell cannot be cast at all. This casting has a longer Casting Time than normal, taking 1 minute to enchant a container the size of a small chest, 10 minutes to enchant a large chest or crate, 1 hour to enchant a cabinet or wardrobe, and 10 hours to enchant a small room, of a maximum of 20&rsquo; x 20&rsquo; in size. A caster may have one such receptacle per point of his Proficiency Bonus. The casting of this spell burns a circular rune-pattern similar to those created by the teleportation circle spell, but on a smaller scale. These patterns are often hidden on the object or room, for if another caster with access to this spell learns the pattern, he may choose to make that receptacle one of his own with a simple casting of this spell.</p>
<p>Banish Item. This has a Casting Time of 1 action. With it, the caster may banish any single item of 10 pounds or less to one of his prepared receptacles, as long as that item will conceivably fit in it. The item must be held by the caster when he casts it, and no one may be contesting his physical possession of it at the time. A bag or container can be banished as a single item, and all its contents will transfer, as long as it does not weigh more than 10 pounds. Items that themselves contain extradimensional space <span><span class="MathJax_Preview">such as bags of holding</span><script type="math/tex">such as bags of holding</script></span> cannot be affected by this spell.</p>
<p>Summon Item. This has a Casting Time of 1 action. With it, the caster may summon any single item of 10 pounds or less from one of his prepared receptacles. The caster must know that the item is in that receptacle, and the item appears in his hand, which must be free and unbound to cast the spell.</p>
<p>At Higher Levels: When this spell is cast at higher levels, it increases the weight and/or number of items that may be summoned or banished. <span><span class="MathJax_Preview">It has no effect on the Prepare Receptacle function of this spell.</span><script type="math/tex">It has no effect on the Prepare Receptacle function of this spell.</script></span> At 4<sup>th</sup> level, the spell may affect up to two items of no more than 20 lbs in total weight. For each spell level thereafter, the spell may affect one additional item, and 10 additional pounds, allowing a 6<sup>th</sup> level casting of the spell to affect four items of up to 40 total lbs, as an example.</p>
<p>Wardaway</p>
<p>1<sup>st</sup>-level evocation</p>
<p>Casting Time: Swift action, or Reaction</p>
<p>Range: 60 feet</p>
<p>Components: V, S</p>
<p>Duration: 2 rounds</p>
<p>You hurl a small, shimmering sphere of twisting magical force at a single opponent in range, striking them unerringly and inflicting a -1 penalty to all attack rolls during the duration of the spell. The character also goes last in initiative order during that time as well. Additionally, the target must make a Wisdom save. Failure on this check inflicts 1d4+4 force damage to the target.</p>
<p>This spell is cast as a Swift action. The spell may be cast as a Reaction if an enemy charges. If the target fails the Wisdom save, not only do they take damage, but their charge is interrupted and they must stop movement after half of their movement has been completed in the charge.</p>
<p>Water Form</p>
<p>7<sup>th</sup>-level transmutation</p>
<p>Casting Time: 1 action</p>
<p>Range: Self</p>
<p>Components: V, S</p>
<p>Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour</p>
<p>You turn into an amorphous puddle of water that resembles an ooze. Your water form uses all of your ability scores, but has 40 hit points and AC 13 + your Dexterity modifier. You revert back to your original form if reduced to 0 hit points. While in water form you are invisible if you are in water <span><span class="MathJax_Preview">whether a body of water, a puddle, or a wet surface</span><script type="math/tex">whether a body of water, a puddle, or a wet surface</script></span>, you gain resistance to slashing, bludgeoning, and piercing damage, you are immune to cold damage and the prone condition, and are restrained until the end of your next turn if you would take cold damage. You may squeeze through tiny openings as small as one inch without penalty. You retain your normal vision and speed, but gain a swim speed equal to your normal movement. You may not attack or cast spells as an amorphous puddle of water. As an action, however, you may cause your watery form to become humanoid, which resembles your normal shape, or revert from humanoid shape to a puddle. While in humanoid form you can talk, attack, cast spells, etc., though you are visible unless completely immersed in water.</p>
<p>At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell with a spell slot of 8<sup>th</sup> level or higher, your watery form gains an additional 20 hit points per slot level used over 7<sup>th</sup>.</p>

The carpet emits dim light in a 10-foot radius. You can dismiss the spell as a free action on your turn or as a reaction.</p>
<p>At Higher Levels. If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6<sup>th</sup> level or higher, you may increase the carpet’s dimensions up to 4 ft. × 6 ft. using a 6<sup>th</sup> level slot, 5 ft. × 7 ft. using a 7<sup>th</sup> level slot, or 6 ft. × 9 ft. using an 8<sup>th</sup> level slot.</p>

For example, if traversing the Realm of the Burnished Flame, you could withstand the intense heat of the environment without taking damage. But, if a volcanic geyser were to throw him into the air, he would still take falling damage as normal.

However, unlike its lesser version, your witch blade deals d8 damage or the equal the type of weapon you choose to manifest, whichever is greater, and acts as an arcane spell focus for the spell’s duration.
Also, when you are the target of a harmful cantrip or spell cast using a 1<sup>st</sup> level spell slot that does not possess 
an area of effect, you may, as a reaction, absorb that spell into the blade causing it to shatter, and ending the spell. When using your blade to absorb a spell, you may choose to either simply allow the spell to dissipate harmlessly or attempt to capture and store the power of that spell for your own use.
