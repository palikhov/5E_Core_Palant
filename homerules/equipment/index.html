<p><strong>Armored Coat</strong> Consisting of a short leather jacket reinforced with hidden metal plates, the protective natur of these jackets can be overlooked. Traditionally, they are fitted with hidden pockets and wrist scabbards that can hold a dagger or other small weapon.
This armor can be easily mistaken for normal clothing; any observer must succeed in a DC 15 Intelligence
(Investigation) check to recognize the true nature of the</p>
<p><strong>Kio Hauberk:</strong> The kio hauberk uses many of the same techniques used to forge the famed kio swords. Metal rings are woven into quilted silk shirts with sleeves ending just above the elbow and flaps down the front and the back ending just below the knee. These flaps are commonly split, allowing the wearer to ride a horse. A coif and thick, metal ring-covered leather gloves typically accompany this armor. 
Like all kio-crafted goods, this armor is rare outside kio families.</p>
<p><strong>Lorica Segmentata:</strong> The armor of the finest and bestequipped Coryani legions, lorica segmentata has seen many improvements over centuries of outstanding service to the Empire. It consists of steel plates bent and molded around the chest and shoulders, then linked together with steel mail worn beneath. Steel arm and leg greaves complete the kit. This armor is built for maximum protection and 
maneuverability.</p>

<p><strong>Penetrating:</strong> Some ranged weapons are particularly effective against armored opponents at close range. Weapons with the penetrating property grant advantage on attack rolls when used against armored opponents within 15 feet. This ability is ineffective against abilities that increase AC but are not armor such as the monk’s Unarmored Defense.</p>
<p><strong>Versatile Damage:</strong> Weapons with this quality have both a primary and a secondary damage type. Your weapon will always do the primary damage type unless you declare otherwise before you roll damage.</p>
<p><strong>Worn:</strong> Worn weapons augment your unarmed attack damage and may not be disarmed. Putting on or removing a worn weapon takes an action. </p>
<h3 id="about-worn-weapons">About Worn Weapons<a class="headerlink" href="#about-worn-weapons" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>You can use weapons you wear on your body, (worn weapons), to make unarmed strikes. When you make an unarmed strike while wearing a worn weapon, you deal the weapon’s damage instead of your normal unarmed strike damage. You must able to use the part of your body where the weapon is attached to make the unarmed strike. You cannot use a cestus to make an unarmed strike if you are using that hand to wield a 
sword or hold a lantern. For example, when you attack with a cestus, your unarmed strike deals 1d4 + your Strength modifier bludgeoning damage, assuming you use the fist wearing the cestus to make that unarmed strike. 
Worn weapons do allow you to benefit from runes and other magical effects that can be applied to weapons.Any rune or spell that would affect a weapon can be applied to a worn weapon, and the rune or effect applies to your unarmed strikes.</p>
<p>Simple Weapons<br />
Weapons with special rules are described here, as well 
as the weapons unique to Arcanis.
Cestus: Popular in the arenas and tavernas of 
Coryan, this reinforced leather glove consists of 
a series of leather thongs that are tied over the 
hand; the thongs secure a set of metal plates, 
one over the knuckles and the other along the 
back of the hand. 
There are two variants of this 
weapon. The myrmex &ldquo;limb-piercer&rdquo; 
has the versatile damage (piercing) 
property and the sphairai &ldquo;bone-
breaker&rdquo; has the versatile damage 
(slashing) property.</p>
<p>Flintlocks: Altheria may be a center of knowledge and learning, but it is the power of blastpowder that has kept the Republic of Altheria safe for many years. The Altherians’ advanced understanding of blastpowder and its explosive potential has aided them in the design of their flintlock weapons. 
Altherian flintlocks are designed to take advantage of specific amounts of blastpowder for every shot, leading to the creation of blastpowder rounds – small paper or cloth packets of blastpowder pre-measured to gain the most efficient and accurate shot. Therefore, these fine weapons are usually easier, safer, and faster to reload and fire.</p>
<p>Altherians, as well as clerics and holy champions of Althares, may purchase flintlocks at the listed price and may carry them regardless of rank.
You do not suffer penalties for firing a flintlock while prone. Unless you have a flintlock maintenance kit and are proficient with it, whenever you roll a 1 on a ranged attack roll with a flintlock the weapon malfunctions and jams. A jammed flintlock cannot be fired. </p>
<p>Repairing a jammed flintlock requires proficient use of a flintlock maintenance kit and takes 10 minutes.</p>
<p>Additionally, in Arcanis flintlocks are reinforced and balanced for use as improvised melee weapons. Flintlock pistols may be used as clubs, while flintlock rifles may be used as greatclubs. If you are proficient with a club or greatclub, you can add your proficiency bonus to attack rolls with your flintlock when you use it as an improvised weapon.</p>

<p>&amp;&amp;Soldier’s Pack (14 gp):** Includes a backpack, a bedroll, a hammer, a mess-kit, 10 pitons, 10 torches, a tinderbox, a tent, 10 days of rations, and a waterskin. The pack also has 50 feet of hempen rope strapped to the side of it. </p>
<p>Optional Rule: Large Weapons and Armor
There are some Heroes who are naturally Large size, or who have the ability to increase their size and become Large.
If this occurs, you may be required to purchase weapons and armor sized for a Large creature.
Finding someone with the skill to forge Large-sized equipment is no easy task, and the equipment itself costs
double its listed price. Large weapons deal an extra die of damage, so a Large longsword deals 2d8 damage. You
cannot wear armor that is too small for you.
If you try to wield a weapon too big for you, you suffer disadvantage on all attack rolls with that weapon, even if
you are proficient with it. If you wear armor that is too big for you, you suffer disadvantage on all Dexterity (Stealth)
checks and your speed is reduced by 10, no matter your Strength.</p>
<p>Lorica Squamata
Medium armor
Description: Lorica squamata consists of a metal scale 
shirt fitted with steel shoulders, like those found on 
lorica segmentata. Used by standard bearers, musicians, 
centurions, and cavalry troops, lorica squamata is common 
within the legions of Coryan, even finding its way to some 
auxiliary infantry legions as well.
Milandisian Andrean Suit of Plate
Heavy armor
Description: Named for Andreas II, former king of 
Milandir and creator of this style of armor, Andrean plate 
offers the greatest protection achieved to date. Though it 
is far too heavy for all but the strongest knights to wear, 
Andrean plate is surprisingly easy to move around in. Its 
clever design permits the wearer to enjoy almost a full range 
of motion. This armor is rare, not because its construction 
is controlled, but because it is extremely expensive to 
manufacture. Only the wealthiest of individuals can afford 
such a suit of armor.
Milandisian Gothic Cuirass
Heavy armor
Description: Milandisian armor smiths are some of the 
most accomplished in the history of the craft. One of 
their many innovations is the Milandisian cuirass, which 
increases the effectiveness of the typical horseman’s cuirass 
by adding a series of cunningly designed curves to the 
breastplate and helm.</p>
<p>Ss’ressen Scale Armor
Light armor
Description: This heavy coat and skirt of scaled leather is 
made from the hides of the huge ss’ressen of the Agamassi 
egg clutch. This extremely rare armor may only be found in 
Altheria or the eloran city of Entaris. It is an accepted fact 
that the elorii were the originators of this type of armor, 
and they have several suits of ss’ressen scale dating back to 
time of the eloran hegemony over the continent.
Special: If you are a ss’ressen with the Natural Armor 
racial ability, they gain a +1 bonus to your AC while 
wearing this armor.
Weapon: Like Sarishan steel weapons, weapons made of tempered Sarishan steel are considered to be magical
weapons for the purposes of bypassing the damage resistance of infernals, but unlike Sarishan steel weapons,
weapons made of tempered Sarishan steel deal an additional 1d6 damage of the weapon’s type when dealing damage to
infernals.
If a tempered Sarishan steel weapon is used while smiting an infernal either using a smite spell or the Smite class
feature, this weapon deals an additional 1d10 damage instead.</p>
<p>Armor: A suit of scale or plate made from fervidite may look dull, but it is much lighter than a similar suit made of a different metal. Fervidite armor removes disadvantage of
Dexterity (Stealth) checks and any Strength requirement to move at full speed caused by the armor. Additionally,
Medium fervidite armor can be worn under clothing,
requiring an observer to succeed on a DC 15 Intelligence
(Investigation) check to spot the armor.
Weapon: Weapons and ammunition made from
fervidite have 50 extra hit points and are considered to be 
217 Arcanis 5e • Chapter 4: Equipment
both adamantine and silver for the purpose of bypassing
damage resistances and immunities, or triggering damage
vulnerabilities. Fervidite can be used to either forge the
blade of a weapon like a sword or it can be used to add
studs and tracings to a weapon like a quarterstaff.
Due to the strength of the metal, ammunition made
from fervidite generally does not break when fired. At the
end of combat, you can recover all expended ammunition
made from fervidite, unless the GM says otherwise. 
\</p>
<p>Armor: While you are wearing a suit of adamantine
armor, anytime you are hit with a critical strike the attack
becomes a normal hit and the armor takes a permanent and
cumulative -1 penalty to AC. Adamantine armor reduced
to AC 10 is destroyed. Some smiths can repair adamantine
armor, but the process is expensive and time consuming.
Usually, it costs half the total purchase cost to repair
adamantine armor.
Weapon: Weapons made of adamantine are virtually
unbreakable and have resistance to all slashing, piercing,
and bludgeoning damage. Some creatures, usually
constructs, have resistances that can only be bypassed by
adamantine weapons.</p>
<p>Weapon: Any weapon made of Sarishan steel is
considered to be a magical weapon for the purposes of
bypassing the damage resistance of infernals. Sarishan
steel can be used to either forge the blade of a weapon like
a sword or it can be used to add studs and tracings to a
weapon like a quarterstaff.
Armor: While you are wearing armor made of Sarishan
steel, damage taken from an infernal’s melee attacks or
special traits that deal damage is reduced by 1. Only armor
primarily made of metal can be made from Sarishan steel.
Shield: While you are wielding a shield made of Sarishan
steel, when you are targeted by an infernal with a spell or
special trait that deals damage, as a reaction you can apply
your shield’s AC bonus to your saving throw against the
triggering effect</p>
<p>Weapon: A weapon crafted primarily of metal can be
made of glass steel. Such weapons weigh half as much as a
normal. Any one-handed sword, such as a longsword, made
from glass steel gains the light or finesse weapon quality,
chosen during construction.
Shields: A shield forged from glass steel weighs only 3 lbs. </p>

10 minutes, after which the glow fades.</p>
<h4 id="gum-bag">Gum Bag<a class="headerlink" href="#gum-bag" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Alchemical equipment
Description: Created from tar and mixed with special 
oils, this mixture is held in small clay containers. When 
the concoction comes in contact with air, it creates a bond 
strong enough to hold a warhorse in place.
Abilities/Effects: As an action, you can throw this 
container up to 20 feet, where it shatters on contact and its 
contents mix and expand. Make a ranged attack against a 
creature or object, treating the gum bag as an improvised 
weapon. On a hit, the target must make a successful DC 15 
Strength saving throw or have their walking speed reduced 
to 0. As an action, at the beginning of their turn, a creature 
affected by the contents of a gum bag may attempt a DC 15 
Strength (Athletics) check to break free. The contents of the 
bag lose its adhesive properties after 1 minute.</p>
<h3 id="moon-ink">Moon Ink<a class="headerlink" href="#moon-ink" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>

flowering plant, this ink is highly prized by any who wish 
to keep their communications secret.
Abilities/Effects: Once anything is written with this ink, 
the writer needs to warm the paper over an open fire to 
cause the ink to quickly disappear. Later, the owner of the 
document may lightly wet the paper and then hold it up 
against a light source (typically the light of the full moon, 
hence its name) to read the message. One vial of ink will 
last for two pages of paper.</p>

<p>Gauntlet</p>
<p>Spiked chain</p>
<p>Spiked shield</p>
<p>Hooked Shortspear martial melee weapon that deals 1d4 piercing damage, weighs 2 pounds, and has the light weapon property (see chapter 5, &ldquo;Equipment,&rdquo; of the Player&rsquo;s Handbook). It doesn&rsquo;t possess the thrown or versatile weapon properties of a normal spear. On a hit with this weapon, the wielder can forgo dealing damage and attempt to trip the target, in which case the target must succeed on a Strength saving throw or fall prone. The DC is 8 + the wielder&rsquo;s Strength modifier + the wielder&rsquo;s proficiency bonus.</p>
<p>Light Repeating Crossbow 1d8, piercing, 40/160 light repeating crossbow fitted with a cartridge that can hold up to six crossbow bolts. This weapon is similar to a light crossbow except that it has half the range (40/160 feet) and doesn&rsquo;t have the loading property. It automatically reloads after firing until it runs out of ammunition. Reloading the cartridge takes an action.</p>

<p><strong>Buckler</strong>: This small shield is fitted around the arm and made of metal, wood, or boiled leather. It takes the same time to don and doff as a normal shield <span><span class="MathJax_Preview">1 action</span><script type="math/tex">1 action</script></span> and a character cannot benefit from a buckler and any other type of shield at the same time. Unlike a shield, a character can still use the hand in which the buckler is equipped. If during a character&rsquo;s turn they use an item with this hand, attack with a weapon in this hand, or attack with a two-handed weapon, then the character does not gain the buckler&rsquo;s bonus to AC until the start of their next turn. Attacking with a one-handed weapon or thrown weapon using the buckler hand causes disadvantage on the attack roll. The hand wielding the buckler does not count as a free hand for the purposes of spellcasting, grappling, or unarmed attacks. A character proficient with shields is also considered proficient with bucklers. A buckler does not benefit from the rules or abilities that specifically refer to shields, such as the Protection Fighting Style or the Shield Master feat.</p>
<p><strong>Tower Shield</strong>: A huge metal-reinforced shield nearly as tall as its wielder. Donning and doffing the tower shield takes 1 action. A character cannot benefit from a tower shield and any other type of shield at the same time. While a tower shield is equipped, its bearer takes disadvantage on all attack rolls due to the off-balancing encumbrance of the shield, unless the weapon has the Light property. A character proficient with both shields and heavy armor is assumed to be proficient with tower shields. All other rules that affect shields still apply to tower shields.</p>

<p>A mastercraft item is an item created with such skill and care that it is clearly superior to a normal item. Not just any craftsmen can create a mastercraft item; only an expert in his or her craft, with exceptional skill and years of experience, can create such an item. Mastercraft items can take the form of weapons, armor, or tools. All mastercraft items are exceptionally durable and can take wear and tear better than a normal item. Although mastercraft items are not magical, magic items are mastercraft items, but their magical description and properties replaces any benefit they grant from being mastercraft. </p>
<h3 id="mastercraft-weapons">Mastercraft weapons<a class="headerlink" href="#mastercraft-weapons" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>Mastercraft weapons are particularly sharp and sturdy. You gain a +1 bonus to damage rolls made with a mastercraft weapon. Your weapon is less likely to break under normal use. Ammunition generally cannot be mastercrafted. If a mastercraft weapon gains a bonus to damage from any other source, that bonus replaces the bonus granted from the weapon being a mastercraft weapon. Mastercraft weapons cost 300 GPs more than the base price of the weapon. A mastercraft weapon can also be silvered, but this costs an additional 100 GPs. </p>

<p>Mastercraft armor and shields provide the same protection as their normal counterparts but weigh less. Mastercraft light armor, medium armor, and shields weigh half as much as normal. Mastercraft heavy armor weighs three-quarters as much as normal. The strength score required to wear mastercraft heavy armor before one&rsquo;s speed is reduced is one point less than the listed score.

You additionally reduce damage taken from a single damage type that corresponds with the original dragon&rsquo;s breath weapon by 1 <span><span class="MathJax_Preview">fire for red dragons, lightning for blue, etc</span><script type="math/tex">fire for red dragons, lightning for blue, etc</script></span>. Wearers are warned, however, that dragons do take ill to those they encounter wearing this. Metals Adamantine: An alloy of adamant, silver, and electrum, or of steel and mithral, it is black in color, with a green sheen in candlelight or a purple-white light in magical radiance. Armor <span><span class="MathJax_Preview">Chain shirt, scale mail, breastplate, half plate; ring mail, chain mail, splint, plate</span><script type="math/tex">Chain shirt, scale mail, breastplate, half plate; ring mail, chain mail, splint, plate</script></span>: Adamant makes armor of exquisite diamond-hard substance. While you&rsquo;re wearing it, any critical hit against you becomes a normal hit. Weapons: Though adamantine weapons have no additional properties, adamantine takes and holds magic quite well. Many magical weapons are wrought of adamantine because of this. Adamant: A gleaming, glossy black refinement of adamantine, a natural jet-black ferromagnetic ore found in obsidian beds. It is gleaming, glossy black, with a rainbow sheen in bright light. It is too brittle to make keen weapons from, but is a favorite of dwarf-folk for hammers. Armor <span><span class="MathJax_Preview">Chain shirt, scale mail, ring mail, chain mail, splint</span><script type="math/tex">Chain shirt, scale mail, ring mail, chain mail, splint</script></span>: Though this jet black metal is too fragile to form actual armor, strips of it can be used to reinforce flexible armors. It strengthens the armor minutely, but its main property is to partially absorb fire. You reduce all slashing damage by 1, and all fire damage by 1d6. In any combat in which you take bludgeoning damage, however, roll a d20 at the end of the combat. If you roll a 9 or lower, the strips of adamant have been shattered and will need to be repaired <span><span class="MathJax_Preview">which costs 20% of the cost to install the reinforcements</span><script type="math/tex">which costs 20% of the cost to install the reinforcements</script></span> by a smith skilled in the working of adamant.

Arandur: Once the exclusive secret of the gnome-kind, arandur is a gleaming silver-blue metal, with a green reflective sheen in sunlight. It also naturally absorbs the magical injuries used to inflict raw kinetic injuries. Armor <span><span class="MathJax_Preview">scale mail, breastplate, half plate; splint, plate; shield</span><script type="math/tex">scale mail, breastplate, half plate; splint, plate; shield</script></span>: When used to make non-flexible metal armors, arandur grants its wearer the ability to reduce force damage by 2.

When you inflict a critical with a slashing or piercing weapons wrought of arandur, add your Proficiency bonus to the final damage total. Darksteel: A silvery metal with a shadowed cast that gleams purple-ish in firelight, darksteel&rsquo;s making is lost today, an ancient secret of teh Ironstar clan of dwarves. Smiths throughout the Realms offer great amounts of gold for the recovery of any lost ingots of the metal.

Dlarun: A little known halfling metal dug up from clumps of river clay and then kilned at high temperatures, dlarun is a bone-white metal that can take a high polish, and gains a distinctive greenish sheen under magical lighting. It has the strange benefit of steadying the minds of those that wear it. Armor <span><span class="MathJax_Preview">Studded leather; breastplate, half plate; splint, plate; shield</span><script type="math/tex">Studded leather; breastplate, half plate; splint, plate; shield</script></span>: Armor wrought of dlarun reduces all bludgeoning and psychic damage by 1, and grants a +1 to saves against all Enchantment spells.

For each item of armor possessed and used, add the following costs to your Lifestyle expenditures per month: 1sp for light armor or shield, 5sp for medium armor, 1gp for heavy armor. Weapon <span><span class="MathJax_Preview">any</span><script type="math/tex">any</script></span>: Gold-filigreed weapons used to strike the undead inflict 1 additional point of radiant damage. For each such weapon, add 2sp to your Lifestyle cost expenditures per month. Mithral: Called the &ldquo;truemetal&rdquo; by dwarf-folk, mithral is derived from soft, glittering, silvery-black ore found in rare veins and pockets from the depths of the Underdark to surface rocks. Armor <span><span class="MathJax_Preview">chain shirt, scale mail, breastplate, half plate; ring mail, chain mail, splint, plate; shield</span><script type="math/tex">chain shirt, scale mail, breastplate, half plate; ring mail, chain mail, splint, plate; shield</script></span>: Mithral lends subtlety and grace to the wearer. If the armor normally inflicts disadvantage on Stealth rolls, that property is negated. If it does not, then the armor can be worn normally under clothes without giving away the fact that the wearer is wearing armor. Weapons <span><span class="MathJax_Preview">slashing or piercing</span><script type="math/tex">slashing or piercing</script></span>: The fine edge of mithral is sung about in elven ballads, and with good reason. When you have advantage on an attack roll, if the lower of the two dice would also hit your target&rsquo;s AC, you inflict an additional d4 damage. Silver: Another common metal, silver is aligned with the powers and mysteries of Selûne. Weapon <span><span class="MathJax_Preview">any</span><script type="math/tex">any</script></span>: Many creatures take grievous wounds from silvered weapons. Though the metal is too soft and costly to make weapons from directly, weapons can easily be silvered with the stuff, granting the property of the metal without taking away from its utility. Telstang: Originally a gnomish secret, this alloy of copper, mithral, platinum, and silver is a dull pewter-silver in hue, and gives off a clear bell-like tone when struck with another metal <span><span class="MathJax_Preview">leading to its other name of "singing metal"</span><script type="math/tex">leading to its other name of "singing metal"</script></span>.

The first is that any sonic damage taken by the wearer is reduced by 1d6 points. The second is that the wearer automatically succeeds at any saving throws that paralyze or change his shape. Any critical hit with bludgeoning or force damage shatters your armor, however <span><span class="MathJax_Preview">though this critical hit only inflicts normal damage instead of doubling it</span><script type="math/tex">though this critical hit only inflicts normal damage instead of doubling it</script></span>. Metal Treatments These are alchemical and metallurgical treatments used to treat specific kinds of metals.</p>
<p>Blueshine: Metal weapons and armor. A treatment that gives a bluish sheen to any items wrought of iron, steel, adamantine, arandur, darksteel, mithral, silver, or telstang, blueshine helps negate caustic substances. The metal part of weapons coated in the stuff become immune to acid damage, and armors coated in it grant resistance to acid damage: reduce all acid damage taken by 1 for medium armors or 2 for heavy armors. Everbright: Metal weapons and armor. A dwarven process now known to smiths of many folk, everbright-treated items gleam with a mirror finish <span><span class="MathJax_Preview">like a chromium finish</span><script type="math/tex">like a chromium finish</script></span>. Metal objects <span><span class="MathJax_Preview">which can only be made of steel, adamantine, or mithral</span><script type="math/tex">which can only be made of steel, adamantine, or mithral</script></span> treated with everbright are immune to rust and the passage of time, and those wearing armor or bearing shields treated with it reduce radiant damage taken by 1 for medium armors and shields or 2 for heavy armors. Remaining unseen while wearing such armor is quite difficult, however; those searching visually for everbright-clad characters gain advantage on their checks to spot them. Halabar&rsquo;s Stealth: Metal weapons and armor. An expensive but increasingly common metal treatment that renders metallic weapons and armor nonferromagnetic, nonreflective, and wholly silent, not even clanging when struck against other metals or stone. Drawing or wielding such weapons will not reveal a hidden character, and metal armor wrought of it does not inflict disadvantage on Stealth checks.</p>

Elixir of the Valinor’s Heart
Potion, very rare
Description: This ornate crystal vial contains a viscous red fluid.
History: Said to have been created by the val’Mehan family during the ancient Blood Wars, the formula for creating this potion was discovered by the Emerald Society during an expedition in the Blessed Lands. Since creating one draught of this elixir requires the complete exsanguination of a val, it was considered too dangerous for public consumption and so consigned to the Vaults of Forbidden Knowledge in New Althre’. Nevertheless, the formula made its way into grimoires of various black sorcerers, witches and unscrupulous Sarishans across the Known Lands.
Abilities/Effects: This elixir grants the drinker the bloodline abilities of a single val family, with the specific powers being dictated by which val was used to create the elixir. For 1 hour after imbibing this elixir, you gain one of the following benefits as appropriate:

If you are a val of a different bloodline from the elixir, you suppress your own powers and replace them with powers chosen from the potion’s bloodline. You may only access a number of bloodline powers equal to those you already have (for example, if you have 3 val bloodline powers presently, you may only access 3 bloodline powers of equivalent level of the val bloodline of the elixir).
If you are not a val you gain no benefits from this elixir, and instead suffer 4d10 poison damage and are poisoned for 1 hour.
Fury Elixir
Potion, uncommon
Description: This milky mixture is usually contained in a metal flask, which bubbles and sizzles when unstopped.

It remained so until the funerary games of the Emperor Calcestus val’Assante. There, a second-rate gladiator butchered a very skilled and favorite fighter of the new emperor. After an investigation, the gladiator confessed to taking the concoction and soon thereafter use of the fury elixir has been prohibited. Even though the elixir blesses the user with greatly enhanced physical attributes and the ability to ignore pain, it later ravages the mind and body leaving many a gladiator an empty husk.

History: Believed known only to the Beltinian high priests for use in their most sacred rituals travelers to the Hinterlands have witnessed the Ehtzara use a similar potion to achieve the same results.

The tribe’s witch doctor prepares the draught from sacred peppers, a fresh kill and invocations to the spirit of the fearsome striped hunter that stalks the land. Though savage, the Nung do understand and appreciate the strange and exotic trinkets that come from trade. Far ranging Chauni and Dailish pirates have managed to acquire the recipe and have sold it to alchemists and scholars across the Known Lands.

<p>Oil of Deflection
Potion, rare
Description: Stored in a hinged shell of a small turtle, this salve is created from a mixture of herbs and a pungent mold that grows deep within swamps and marshes. Rumors persist of additional, if less savory, ingredients but what these are is something that the ss’ressen priestesses are unwilling to share. After letting the concoction cool after boiling, it creates a smelly paste that is applied by smearing it over the user’s body.

Abilities/Effects: You gain 10 temporary hit points and have advantage on Strength and Constitution saving throws for 1 minute.
Oil of Pyrotechnics

Oil of Scent Masking
Potion, uncommon
Description: This amber colored oil is odorless. When applied, this oil masks the scent of the wearer.
History: This oil was first discovered being used by poachers raiding the preserves of Balantica to avoid the hounds and other beasts used to safeguard the area. When questioned, the poachers couldn’t identify who sold them the oil. The ruling val’Dellenov family believes that it must have been the neighboring val’Borda family, testing the oil’s efficacy before issuing it to their spies. For their part, the scions of Cadic vehemently deny any such accusations.
Abilities/Effects: After spreading this oil upon your body, any creature who attempts to track or locate you though scent suffers disadvantage on their ability checks for the next three hours.

Potion, (lesser) rare; (greater) very rare
Description: This potion is dark red, almost the purple of a bruise, with a silver effervesce when unstopped.
History: Seeking a way to emulate the ability some mages wield Adkir, a member of the Ymandrake Order of Wine Drinkers, studied and experimented around the clock, much to the agony of his test subjects, until he unlocked the secret of the formulae. Through a laborious process, he was able to distill the very essence in a sorcerer’s blood that allows him to manipulate arcane power. After hurriedly preparing his first vial of it, he presented it to Order. Needless to say, his superiors were most pleased and Adkir’s worth to the Wine Drinkers soared.
Only accomplished Wine Drinkers are allowed access to the lesser bloodmastery potion and the secret of its creation, while only the highest-ranking Wine Drinkers have access to the greater bloodmastery potion. Adkir has recently perfected an even more powerful bloodmastery potion that emulates specific val family bloodline abilities, but gleefully waits to demonstrate its marvelous efficiency in a large-scale slaughter of some kind. His Order finds this amusing. The vals certainly won’t.
Abilities/Effects: When casting a spell, you may drink this potion as an additional material component. Its effects depend on the rarity of the potion. If you drink this potion and you are not a Wine Drinker, you suffer disadvantage on any saving throw against spells until the beginning of your next turn, in addition to its other effects.

Potion, uncommon
Description: This vile liquid is sickly green in color and is usually held in a putrescent skin.
History: Fanatical Nerothians aspiring to one day receive the blessing of Neroth and join the ranks of undead, use this potion to emulate their betters.

Potion, rare

Potion, uncommon
Description: These oils were once stored in glass upon which were inscribed prayers and benedictions of the various Gods. During the Fifth Crusade, common tin flasks were used and reused due to the King’s orders to produce large quantities of the oil.
History: Once a rare commodity and given sparingly to only the most pious and worthy, sanctified oils were produced in large quantities by order of King Osric during the Fifth Crusade of Light. So commonplace were these sacred oils that the soldiers began to irreverently calling it, “the Gods’ spit”. With their stores of ingredients depleted, temple priests were unable to produce the quantities demanded of them twenty years later at the inception of the Sixth Crusade of Light, leading to a higher mortality rate among the rank and file in their battles against Infernals.
Abilities/Effects: As an action you may apply this oil on a non-magical weapon, shield or suit of armor. If applied to a weapon, the weapon becomes temporarily magical, 
granting a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls with that weapon. If applied to a shield or armor, it grants a +1 bonus to AC while wearing the armor or holding the shield. This effect lasts for 1 hour.
Voei Skin Salve
Potion, very rare
Description: This clay jar contains a brownish-green liquid with the viscosity of syrup. When applied to the bare skin, flesh takes on a thick and warty quality, darkening slightly, and giving off a cinnamon aroma.
History: The formula for this noxious salve was discovered by Calyce val’Dellenov during an expedition to the Fervidus Hills. Her party of explorers came across the deserted encampment of a tribe of savage Voei. While the rest of the expedition sifted for rare Voei artifacts, Calyce stumbled upon the dwelling of the tribe’s witchdoctor. Among the many strange items in the hut, she came across a sample of a strange salve. When applied to the skin, the flesh becomes hard and warty, taking on a brown tinge and making it resistant to many types of harm.
After years of experimentation mostly on herself, Calyce was able to replicate the recipe and manufacture more of the paste. Unfortunately, Calyce also learned that the salve has an addictive quality to it, until eventually, the being that was Calyce val’Dellenov was cornered and incinerated, ending her homicidal rampage throughout the streets of Old Coryan.
Abilities/Effects: You cannot apply this paste if you have levels of exhaustion. Once applied, the paste remains active for 1 hour. While active, you heal 10 hit points of damage at the beginning of your turn. This healing is suppressed for 1 round if you suffer acid or fire damage.
If you are reduced to 0 hit points while under the effects of this potion, you automatically succeed on all death saving throws, and begin to regain hit points after your third death save. If you suffer acid or fire damage while below 0 hit points, you automatically fail your death saving throws as normal for suffering damage while unconscious.
After this paste wears off, you gain 1 level of exhaustion.
War Paints of the Skohir
Potion, very rare
Description: These body paints are fashioned by Skohir shamans from the paste made from red seaweed found in the shallows of islands known only to them. This paste is mixed during a complex ritual while with various herbs, roots and seeds to create pastes of different colors and textures, while appealing to various spirits to empower the mixiuie.
History: Used by the Skohir during raids or for rare standing battles against rival Yhing-hir tribes or Milandisians, it makes these formidable warriors even more deadly and fearsome.
Abilities/Effects: The war paint requires 1 hour to apply as the application must be precise and pleasing to the spirits. For 1 hour, these pigments protect you, granting an AC of 14 + your Dexterity modifier. In addition, the war paint grants different effects depending upon the type of pigment applied.
Red war paint gives advantage on Strength and Dexterity saving throws
Blue gives advantage on Intelligence and Wisdom saving throws
Violet affords a +1d4 bonus to all weapon damage rolls.
Black grants the ability to take the Hide action as a bonus action on your turn as well as the benefits of the pass without trace spell (self-only, no concentration required).</p>
