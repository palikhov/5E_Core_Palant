                <h1 id="types-of-stronghold">TYPES OF STRONGHOLD<a class="headerlink" href="#types-of-stronghold" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h1>
<p>There are four types of basic stronghold, one complex stronghold, and many varieties. Any character can build or use any stronghold, although why a non-spell¬casting character might build a tower is an exercise left to the reader. Maybe they have a spellcasting NPC ally!
A keep is a martial stronghold for characters inter¬ested in raising armies and defending the local towns¬folk. Barbarian camps and pirate ships are variations on this.
A tower is an arcane stronghold for doing spell research and learning battle magic.
A temple is a divine stronghold for summoning extraplanar allies and learning battle magic. A druid’s grove is a popular variation.
An establishment is an espionage stronghold for sabotaging your enemies and generating revenue.</p>

<h3 id="castles-complex-strongholds">Castles: Complex Strongholds<a class="headerlink" href="#castles-complex-strongholds" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>A stronghold belongs to whoever pays for it, and they are its master. If Cail the Wizard builds a tower, he gets to decide who gains its benefits. He may allow his sorcerer or warlock pals to do spell research there&hellip; until one or both betrays him! Or he, them! Only one character can gain the benefit of a given stronghold at a time, and each character can only benefit from one stronghold ability at a time.
If multiple characters chip in to pay for a strong¬hold—or one character just spends a lot of money—it is a castle and provides multiple benefits. Complex tasks take proportionally more time and money than simple ones, so a castle costs 10% more and takes 10% longer for every basic stronghold function it incorporates.</p>
<h3 id="ruins">Ruins.<a class="headerlink" href="#ruins" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>Repairing a ruin saves you half the time and cost of the final stronghold. </p>
<h2 id="extended-rest">EXTENDED REST<a class="headerlink" href="#extended-rest" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>Strongholds grant special abilities, which quickly run out of uses and must be recharged by taking an extended rest. An extended rest requires spending a week at your stronghold, touching base with your sub¬jects and followers, and attending to your affairs.</p>
<h2 id="keep">KEEP<a class="headerlink" href="#keep" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<h3 id="training">TRAINING<a class="headerlink" href="#training" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>A keep means an army, and an army requires training! </p>
<p>As you train your soldiers, you get better with your own gear, gaining the following bonuses based on the weapons or armor that you use. Choose one of the fol¬lowing training benefits.
You cannot gain the benefit of training from armor, shields, or weapons you are not proficient in. You can change which training you receive during an extended rest (page 15).</p>
<p>Light Armor Training: You have advantage on Dex¬terity checks while wearing light armor.</p>
<p>Medium Armor Training: You gain 5 feet of extra movement while wearing medium armor. This move¬ment does not provoke attacks of opportunity. </p>
<p>Heavy Armor Training: You learn to present your most heavily armored facing to your foes. Ranged attacks have disadvantage against you as crossbow bolts bounce and acid arrows splash harmlessly (some¬times) off your armor.</p>
<p>Bludgeoning Training: When you score a critical hit, the target has disadvantage on attack rolls, saving throws, and skill checks until the start of your next turn.</p>
<p>Finesse Training: When an adjacent enemy dam¬ages you with a melee weapon, you may, as a reaction, make a melee attack against them with your wielded finesse weapon.</p>
<p>Piercing Training: You deal an extra 1d6 damage to creatures wearing heavy armor.</p>
<p>Reach Training: If you hit with a reach weapon, you can move the target 5 feet, but they must remain within your reach. This movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity.</p>
<p>Shield Training: If you succeed in a weapon attack while wielding a shield, you can push your target 5 feet away from you. This movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity.</p>
<p>Slashing Training: You deal an extra 1d6 damage to creatures wearing light, natural, or no armor.</p>
<p>Versatile Training: While wielding a versatile weapon in two hands, you gain +1 AC.</p>
<h3 id="the-barbarian-camp">THE BARBARIAN CAMP<a class="headerlink" href="#the-barbarian-camp" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>Barbarians are famous for keeps! In that under no circumstance would they ever build one. They are why other people build keeps! To a barbarian, the idea of putting all your men in an immobile walled jail seems ridiculous.
Of course, strictly speaking anyone can build any stronghold. And what counts as a “barbarian” has nothing to do with what’s on your character sheet. You can easily be a fighter or ranger who looks and behaves in a classical barbarian mode.</p>
<h3 id="the-pirate-ship">THE PIRATE SHIP<a class="headerlink" href="#the-pirate-ship" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>Another variation of the Keep is the dreaded Pirate Ship. The Pirate Ship (a galleon, but one dedicated to piracy) is a mobile stronghold like the Barbarian camp. But while the Barbarian camp gets slower the larger it is, a Pirate Ship gets faster! Its larger sails resist the wind much more efficiently than the larger hull drags through the water.1
The Pirate Ship functions as a Keep with the follow¬ing differences.</p>
<p>•   It attracts units just like a keep, but with restrictions to their Size. The ship may not carry units larger than Size 1d6. If rolling on the Units Raised by Keep chart (page 17) would produce a unit larger than Size 1d6, roll again. The ship can hold and no more units than its stronghold level. A fully upgraded Pirate Ship (level 5) could therefore carry five units. There is no restriction on the type of units a Pirate Ship may carry.</p>
<p>•   The ship can move five sea hexes per day,    plus one hex per level of the ship.</p>
<p>•   If the ship sacks (i.e wins a battle against) a port settlement, the settlement’s Develop¬ment Level is downgraded by one.</p>
<p>•   Spending a week in a port settlement gener¬ates 100 gp. </p>

<h3 id="spell-research">SPELL RESEARCH<a class="headerlink" href="#spell-research" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>We know player characters can invent spells—we see them throughout the text of the core game. Famous wizard PCs in the 1970s and the spells their players invented have been with us for the entire history of the game.</p>
<p>So we know it can be done, and it has been done, but back in the day the player would just tell the GM what their idea for a spell was, and the GM would come up with some suitably dangerous and heroic quest to acquire the ingredients and lore for the research, and then, quest complete, the GM would figure out the level of the spell to balance it.</p>
<p>You can still do this and, indeed, you don’t really need rules for it. It’s the kind of thing you do because there are no rules for it.
The core books have rules for creating new spells, but they’re in the back and I don’t get the sense they’re widely used. They also rely on a combination of player initiative (first, think of a new spell that isn’t already covered by one of the hundreds in the game) and GM approval (and the GM has to find a way to balance it, which is probably not fun), and if you’re already doing that, do you need those rules? They’re mostly just guide¬lines for how much damage spells do at which level.</p>
<p>Spell research should be fun, and one of the reasons it’s fun is that it’s unpredictable. My all-time favorite chart is the old Potion Miscibility table, which I wanted to roll on not because really good things could happen, but because really good things and really bad things could happen! Sometimes simultaneously! Any result was exciting and dramatic, and even if my character exploded, I would have been delighted.</p>
<p>This spell research system is all about rolling on charts, because in my experience as a player, when I see charts like the Potion Miscibility table or the Wild Magic chart, or the old-school Wand of Wonder chart, I just want to roll on them.</p>
<p>In this book, all the results of spell research benefit the caster, but not all of them are equally useful, and some of them are Weird. But because these benefits are rewards for building a stronghold, there are no bad results.</p>
<h3 id="inventing-a-new-spell">INVENTING A NEW SPELL<a class="headerlink" href="#inventing-a-new-spell" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>Inventing a new spell from scratch is sort of a pain in the ass and hard to balance and requires a unique com¬bination of player ingenuity and GM balancing that can be a lot of work and not all of it fun.</p>
<p>But researching an existing spell? Taking a here¬tofore boring spell and making it do something extra and neat and maybe weird? Going into your research laboratory and not knowing exactly what you’re going to get when you come out? That’s magical. Here’s how it works.</p>
<h4 id="pick-a-spell">Pick a Spell<a class="headerlink" href="#pick-a-spell" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>You  can only research arcane spells, not divine spells— gods get really bitchy if you start trying to monkey with their ineffable Will. This means the spell must be on the spell list of the bard, eldritch knight, wizard, warlock, or sorcerer. 5<sup>th</sup> Edition doesn’t really have the clear division of arcane and divine spells, but you’ll notice that it doesn’t give clerics or druids or paladins access to spells with someone’s name in the title. Named spells are apparently, unique to “arcane spellcasters,” and we like that tradition. 
The GM can, of course, allow a divine character to research spells, and why not. It’s just not the default assumption.
You must be able to cast the spell you want to research, and the spell can’t have a proper name in it.
You may choose to research a cantrip, but the researched cantrip will be a lst-level spell (see Casting the Spell on page 27).</p>
<h4 id="pick-the-target-of-the-spell">Pick the Target of the Spell<a class="headerlink" href="#pick-the-target-of-the-spell" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>These categories aren’t comprehensive, but broadly applicable. Some spells may fall under multiple cate¬gories. “Does damage” applies to many spells that also fit elsewhere on the list. The goal is to let the player choose the category, and the GM interprets the exact target broadly.</p>
<p>The target of the spell can be:</p>
<p>•   Yourself or one ally</p>
<p>•   One enemy</p>
<p>•   All bad guys in an area</p>
<p>•   All allies in an area</p>
<p>•   The spell does damage</p>
<p>Some spells don’t fit into any of these categories, typ¬ically ones that bestow knowledge or that summon or create things. For such spells, the above list has enough effects that you could easily choose something from it or even create a unique list by picking and choosing effects below for a player to roll, but we recommend “yourself or one ally” for spells that don’t otherwise fit a category since presumably the spellcaster is ben¬efiting in some way from the spell.</p>
<h3 id="research">Research<a class="headerlink" href="#research" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>Researching a spell takes time and money. The money is spent buying arcane materials to use as prospective components. Many potential components must be tested to determine which is the proper one for this new spell. Special tomes must be procured describing the creation of the original spell, pointing the way towards a means to modify it.</p>
<p>The time spent takes 8 hours of every day, six days a week. The arcanist is able to take breaks a few times each day to speak with their lieutenant and command their followers, oversee the construction of their tower, but they spend the required time in research. If this time is interrupted, the new spells slips from their mind and they must start again.</p>
<p>To research a spell, the magic-user must spend 1 month, plus 1 week per level of the spell, minus 1 week per level of their tower.</p>
<p>(Acid) Melting: Objects carried by the target are hit and take damage equal to the spell’s damage.</p>
<p>(Bludgeoning) Sundering: For the spell’s dura¬tion, armor worn by the targets degrades by 2. Sundering effects do not stack.</p>
<p>(Cold) Chilling: Affected targets are grappled until the end of their next turn.</p>
<p>(Fire) Incinerating: Affected targets continue to burn, taking an extra 1d6 damage at the start of each round until they spend an action extinguishing the flames.</p>
<p>(Force) Detonating: Affected targets are knocked prone. On their next turn, they must make a Wisdom saving throw to stand up. On their following turn, they may stand up nor¬mally without making a save.</p>
<p>(Lightning) Shocking: Affected targets have disadvantage on all saving throws until the end of your next turn.</p>
<p>(Necrotic) Unholy:2 1d4 ghouls rise from the ground, each anywhere you choose within 30 feet. They obey your commands for a number of rounds equal to your spellcasting modifier, then crumble to dust.</p>
<p>(Piercing) Puncturing: For 10 minutes, weapon attacks against affected targets score critical hits on attack rolls of 15 or higher.3 (Poison) Nauseating: Affected targets forgo their next turn, spending it vomiting.</p>
<p>•   (Psychic) Hallucinating: On their next turn, the targets perceive allies as enemies and enemies as allies, and act accordingly.</p>
<p>•   (Radiant) Dazzling: Each target is blind until the end of its next turn.</p>
<p>•   (Slashing) Wounding: Each target takes 1d10 damage at the end of its next turn.</p>

<h2 id="alternative-tower-rules-towers-by-school">ALTERNATIVE TOWER RULES: TOWERS BY SCHOOL<a class="headerlink" href="#alternative-tower-rules-towers-by-school" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>Here are some simple rules for towers by school, in case you don’t like the spell research system.</p>
<p>Upon finishing a tower, the magic-user must dedicate it to one of the eight schools of magic. It is traditional to give your tower a name based on the school—like, if you choose Divination, you might call your stronghold a Tower of Prophecy. Necromancy&hellip;well, a Tower of Necromancy is pretty cool, but also the Tower of Death is pretty badass. Or the Black Tower, or the Tower of Pale Flesh. You get the idea.</p>
<p>A magic-user who studies at their tower for a week can prepare and cast spells from their tower’s school as if the spell were cast at one level higher. In other words, fireball, studied by a 5<sup>th</sup>-level warlock with an evocation tower, would cast as a 4<sup>th</sup>-level spell and do an extra 1d6 damage, even though the warlock was using a 3<sup>rd</sup>-level slot.</p>
<p>A magic-user can only prepare spells in this way a number of times equal to the level of their tower  (so typically once when starting out). After this, they must return home and spend a week researching in their tower.</p>
<p>Velorin finishes his tower and dedicates it to necromancy. He memorizes bestow curse at 3<sup>rd</sup> level, but when he casts it, it behaves in all other ways like a 4<sup>th</sup>-level spell, extending the dura¬tion to &ldquo;concentration.”</p>
<p>All the necromancy spells he casts that day are cast as though they were one level higher. But because his tower is only 1<sup>st</sup> level, he cannot pre¬pare his necromantic spells this way again until he spends a week in his tower. After upgrading to a 2<sup>nd</sup>-level tower, he may now spend 2 days casting necromantic spells at higher level.</p>
<p>You could, of course, decide that towers in your campaign grant both these benefits and spell research (see below).</p>
<h3 id="optional-rule-effort">Optional Rule: Effort<a class="headerlink" href="#optional-rule-effort" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>Another method I’ve used and enjoyed allows the magic-user to cast their specialist spells as though they were one level higher with no limit (other than the normal limits of spells by level per day), but each time they cast a spell at a higher level, they must make a Constitution check of DC 10 plus the spell’s level. If they fail, they suffer one level of exhaustion. A full rest removes one level of exhaustion. </p>
<h2 id="temple">TEMPLE<a class="headerlink" href="#temple" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<h3 id="concordance">CONCORDANCE<a class="headerlink" href="#concordance" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>The measure of how pleased your deity2 is with you is called concordance. If your deity is pleased enough to reward you, then you are referred to as “in concor¬dance” with your deity. If they are not pleased, then you are out of concordance. Typically, there is no way to know whether you’re in or out before you petition your deity. Your concordance is known only to your GM.</p>
<p>Every deed you do that furthers your god’s ethos increases your concordance and makes your god more likely to grant you a boon in battle. Failing to uphold your patron’s ethos has a similarly negative consequence. A cleric’s Divine Intervention is a much-improved version of this same ability. Concordance is available to everyone but has a downside and only grants specific rewards. Divine Intervention only works for Clerics, has no down¬side and can potentially fix any problem.</p>
<p>The gods consider it your responsibility to know right from wrong. If you are tricked by an enemy into doing their bidding, the gods are just as angry at you as they would be if you helped the enemy willingly. Theydon’t pay very close attention and don’t have time to evaluate the subtleties of situational ethics.</p>
<h3 id="petitioning-your-deity">PETITIONING YOUR DEITY<a class="headerlink" href="#petitioning-your-deity" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>The number-one way to lose concordance is to use it. As an action, you can petition your deity for aid. The GM3 rolls percentile dice and, depending on your character’s concordance, you may receive aid, be ignored, or punished for your repeated badgering. The gods can help you, but they get really annoyed when you pester them. Each time you petition your god and make a concordance roll, you lose some concordance depending on the result you get (with no loss if you attract a servitor).</p>
<p>Then there’s a temporary penalty based on the number of times you’ve petitioned in the last week. Anyone can petition their deity and hope to get a reply, but unless you’ve been busting your ass (or have a temple), there’s a good chance you’ll be cursed just for being annoying.</p>
<h3 id="druid-groves">DRUID GROVES<a class="headerlink" href="#druid-groves" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>A variant temple, the druid’s grove  gives up the bonus to concordance for owning a temple in exchange for installing a powerful spell, including spells you don’t know or which might not be on the druid spell list, into the grove making it permanent.</p>
<p>The druid chooses one spell from the list below and spends a month in meditation. If the powers that grant them their spells are pleased with their work, they permanently install the spell the druid requested, which can be cast once per period listed in the Grove Spells table</p>
<h2 id="establisment">ESTABLISMENT<a class="headerlink" href="#establisment" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>Revenue
Each season (or every four months, depending on the calendar of your campaign world), your establishment generates 1,000 gp per establishment level.
If your establishment is part of a castle, you can use this money to upgrade your castle, no problem.</p>
<h3 id="rumors">RUMORS<a class="headerlink" href="#rumors" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>During an adventure or in the lead-up to one, you can spend some money and collect some rumors about the quest you’re about to go on. The cost is 100 gp per estab¬lishment level.</p>
<p>On a successful Gather Intel check (see below), you learn the name of one kind of creature you’ll be fight¬ing (goblins, bandits, dragons, oozes, etc.) and roughly how many there will be (a few, a dozen, dozens, a score, scores, etc.). During the adventure, those creatures will be vulnerable to damage from your attacks, for a number of attacks equal to your establishment level.</p>
<p>In addition, the GM can choose to reveal any of the following:
•   The location of a secret door or a hidden entrance or exit
•   The location and nature of a trap
•   A description of one riddle or puzzle
•   The location and description of one powerful magic item</p>
<p>It may seem like this is taking the fun out of the adventure, but for the player with the establishment it will seem like the opposite. It will make them feel awesome, and at the end of the day, you can always add more traps and secret doors!</p>
<h3 id="gathering-intel">GATHERING INTEL<a class="headerlink" href="#gathering-intel" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>Investigation allows you to do detective work, learning the whereabouts and activities of individuals, but orga¬nizations are larger and more complex. By collecting a little information from everyone who visits, your estab¬lishment lets you spy on organizations and people. This is represented by your Gather Intel skill, gained if you own an establishment.</p>
<p>Intel lets you know what your enemies are up to, along with your allies and those organizations—guilds, orders, countries, and such—who claim to be neutral. What you learn is up to the GM. It will be useful but highly generalized. For example, “The Monks of White Fire know you recovered the sword of a million years and they’re planning on taking it from you,” or “The king is closing trade across the southern border.” Okay, that’s good to know, but it’s narrative. There’s no mechanic tied to these things.</p>
<h4 id="organizations">Organizations<a class="headerlink" href="#organizations" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>An organization is any collection of people who agree to common rules and hierarchy in order to further some agenda, goal, or philosophy. An order of knights, a wizards’ college, a thieves’ guild, a duchy, a barony, a church—though not a single church building, but the network of priests and acolytes who all believe in the same doctrine.</p>
<p>You don’t have to know an organization exists to gather intel on it! In fact, that is a classic use of the Gather Intel skill! “I think there’s a conspiracy to infil¬trate the Knights of the White Hart, but I don’t know by whom. Can I make a roll?”</p>
<p>The GM knows the nature of this villainous orga¬nization and can set the DC accordingly and let the player roll. If they succeed, they learn the name of the organization and possibly something about its makeup and goals.</p>
<h4 id="range">Range<a class="headerlink" href="#range" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Obviously you can’t use your establishment to deduce the existence of organizations on the other side of the world. Your establishment is only effective against organizations operating within 24 miles times its estab¬lishment level. On many maps, a hex is 24 miles from side to side.</p>
<p>So, a lst-level establishment could spy on organiza¬tions in its hex and in the six hexes around it (a one-hex radius). A 2<sup>nd</sup>-level establishment could spy on its hex and the 18 closest hexes (a two-hex radius).</p>
<h3 id="making-the-check">Making the Check<a class="headerlink" href="#making-the-check" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>Gather Intel is a skill granted by your establishment, and it uses your stronghold level as its maximum bonus instead of an ability modifier.  So, a lst-level establish¬ment would let you make Gather Intel checks at a max¬imum bonus of +1. You are automatically proficient in Gather Intel if you have an establishment and add your proficiency modifier.</p>
<p>Gathering intel costs money—it’s expensive to pay folks to spy on people! It costs 100 gp per level of your establishment. Larger establishments with larger bonuses have more people to pay! For each increment of 100 gp you pay, you gain a +1 bonus to the check. No, you can’t pay nothing to roll at +0.</p>
<p>Jennifer has a 3<sup>rd</sup>-level establishment (a gen¬eral store). If she pays 300 gp, she can make a Gather Intel check at +3. She cannot pay 400 gp to get +4, because she is limited by the level of her establishment. But she could choose to pay 200 gp to get +2 to her roll.
You may make a number of Gather Intel checks per season equal to your establishment level, but you cannot make more than one check against the same organization during the same season.</p>
<h3 id="setting-the-dc">Setting the DC<a class="headerlink" href="#setting-the-dc" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>Some organizations are easier to spy on than others! Players, when you specify the organization you’re spying on, the GM sets the DC based on the criteria in this section, and you only get results for the organiza¬tion you named, not the smaller organizations it con¬trols.</p>
<p>Exactly how these factors determine the DC of the Gather Intel check is up to the GM, just as there are no hard and fast rules for what counts as “difficult” lore for character making an Arcana check.</p>
<p>How Big Is the Organization? Bigger organizations are easier to spy on than smaller ones, because large organizations have more members and therefore more opportunities to eavesdrop on, blackmail, or infil¬trate them.</p>
<p>Some organizations contain organizations of their own. A church may sponsor a secret order of knights. Spying on the church is easy—it’s a big organization that operates out in the open. But that Gather Intel check won’t tell you what the covert knights are up to. If you want to know that, you’ll have to tell your GM before you roll, and they’ll set the DC higher as a result. </p>
<p>Is the Organization Covert? Covert organizations are harder to spy on. They work to hide their operations as a matter of course. Duchies and churches are, as a rule, public institutions, and normal people can expect to at least be able to find and petition their agents, even if such an organization is tyrannical and unlikely to heed any such petition. They’re pretty easy to spy on.</p>
<p>In contrast, even large, known covert organizations such as Nine Silver, the guild of spies and assassins in Capital, are still covert. People know they exist! But they have no idea how to contact them or even who belongs to them.</p>
<p>How Protective Is the Organization? Does the orga¬nization know they’re being spied on? Do they have counterintelligence agents who actively oppose the player’s spies? A thieves’ guild is much, much harder to spy on than a merchants’ guild, and powerful rulers can deploy highly trained agents to prevent enemies from spying on them.</p>
<h3 id="results">Results<a class="headerlink" href="#results" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>Remember that the benefits of a stronghold are a reward for spending money and time. So the results of a successful Gather Intel check should be useful, “actionable,” meaning they should give information that helps the players make a plan, or develop a strat¬egy, or advance the plot.</p>
<p>Avoid confirming suspicions. In other words, if a player says, “I think the Order of Five Stars is secretly in league with the baron,” and they roll well, do not merely say, “Yes that’s true.” That is deeply unsatisfy¬ing, since the player already suspected that.</p>
<p>Instead, give them something to act on. “Yes, it seems like they are in league. Your people overheard a con¬versation that only makes sense if the wizard Luris is selling information to the baron.”</p>
<p>Hey now, that is actionable. Maybe you just made up that wizard, that’s fine! That’s your job! But now the player has something to do. </p>
<h3 id="limits">Limits<a class="headerlink" href="#limits" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>Your players will make a Gather Intel check, and you’ll give them some juicy bit of knowledge, but of course you’re not going to tell them everything. Which means they’re going to ask for more. They’ll want to drill down on what you said and pursue it. “Where did I get this info? Who told it to me?”</p>
<p>This just makes your life as GM more complicated because we GMs, of course, have no idea exactly who their spies heard this from, and if we’re suddenly faced with the responsibility of not only inventing an NPC who we didn’t know about five seconds ago, but also figuring out the entire signal path of how this NPC knows what they know and who they got it from, then we’re going to want to ditch this whole system because it just makes more problems than solutions.</p>
<p>So when your players inevitably ask, “How exactly do I know this?” there’s one easy answer: “Someone who works for you, someone you trust, overheard it, but they don’t remember who said it.”</p>
<p>You can even play it out. When the player, out of character, asks, “How do I know this?” You can respond in character. “Don’t know, ma’am. I was workin’ the shop and overheard it. Ooh it musta been a week or more ago?”</p>
<p>The player may not be satisfied by that and may even try to subvert the system by giving orders to their employees to, like, write everything down or keep a journal. At this point, it is perfectly appropriate to tell them, “This is the limit of what your stronghold can do.” No point in misleading them—just give it to them straight. They are looking for a degree of specificity this system does not support.</p>
<p>The best character to deliver the results of the Gather Intel check to the PC is the PC’s lieutenant. This is the character who runs the establishment while the PC is out adventuring and who is a trusted NPC. When pressed, “how did you get this information?” the lieu¬tenant can shrug and say “I didn’t collect it personally, one of the workers we employ overheard it.”</p>
<p>If the player is persistent and really wants to dig down and get more details, that may be reasonable, but it might also require more work on your part to invent an answer. In which case that’s a good reason to ask for another Gather Intel check.</p>

<p>The Keep
You can buy mercenary units equal in number to your establishment level. But because your establishment is not a Keep, upkeep on these units costs 50% more. You can keep these units for as long as you pay the upkeep. The units are housed in temporary barracks  outside the city or town your establishment is in.
This is a one-time purchase. If you want to buy more units, you must pay for another favor.</p>
<h3 id="tower_1">TOWER<a class="headerlink" href="#tower_1" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>Choose a modified spell researched by an NPC ally or other party member. You can cast that modified spell a number of times equal to your establishment level before you forget it. Once you forget it, you must pay for another favor in order to cast it again.</p>
<h3 id="temple_1">TEMPLE<a class="headerlink" href="#temple_1" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>Choose an allied NPC or party member with a temple. You can petition their deity and use their concordance once. If you summon a servitor, it remains for a number of rounds equal to your establishment level.
The money for the favor goes to the ally. A PC ally could refuse to grant the favor but they cannot change how much the favor costs. They may want to negoti¬ate better terms, or get something else in return, but the benefits of the favor originate from the establish¬ment and the power of the network of people in your employ to lie, manipulate, and double-deal so that the folks granting the favor think it was their idea. A PC ally therefore might want to name their own terms, (“I will grant you this favor if&hellip;,”) but if they accept the payment, the establishment’s owner gets the favor. As a rule, an NPC ally will not try to negotiate. They will accept the money and the PCs gains the favor. </p>

If your dragon is incredibly good-natured and well-disposed to you, it may let you ride it, but this is rare, for dragons are proud creatures. That being said, in times of desperation, your allies may come to your aid in combatespecially when defending your realm—and in these times legends tell of great paladins who rode their dragon allies into battle. Probably the dragon versions of these stories tell a different tale.
