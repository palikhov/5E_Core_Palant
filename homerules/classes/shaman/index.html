                <p>Shaman 
“Listen, child, do you hear that? It is the wailing of the spirits. 
They speak of innocent blood spilled. They whisper warnings 
of terrible dangers to come. They tell of the fall of cities and 
Empires. Do you not hear their cries? No? Then you will surely 
fall to the doom they announce.”
—Falin, Yhing hir shaman
Across Arcanis, there are those who hear the calling of the 
spirits, the song of the wind, the whispers of trees, and the 
gentle murmuring of water. Though the civilizing influence 
of the Coryani Empire has swayed many to the Mother 
Church, there are still those who honor and pay homage 
to the powerful spirits that constantly surround all living 
things.
Their names may change from culture to culture, but 
most know these men and women as shamans: the speakers 
of the spirits. Though the </p>
<p>Mother Church discounts them as heretics, infernalists, or 
simply ignorant savages, the power of the shaman should 
not to be discounted or scorned. They can sway the forces 
of nature to do their bidding and summon spirits that can 
make the most faithful Beltinian quake with fear. 
Cultures and the Shaman: Shamans are commonly 
found in the Hinterlands, the League of Princes, among 
the ss’ressen who usually worship Jeggal Sag, as well as 
many barbarian tribes in remote areas. The elorii do not 
have a tradition of primal magic and in fact look down 
on the practice. A shaman from the Coryani Empire, the 
Kingdom of Milandir, or the Free City-States of Almeric 
would necessarily be a hermit or might have attracted the 
attention of a curious or mischievous spirit. Such shamans 
will never be part of common society and are viewed with 
suspicion, pity, and fear.</p>
<p>Class Features   <br />
As a shaman, you have the following 
class features:
Race Restrictions
Dwarves, elorii, and kio may not be 
shaman. Vals cannot take the shaman 
class as the spirits are wary of their 
celestial birthright, fearing the more 
powerful Valinor. The spirits will not 
become a val’s spiritual patron for fear 
of offending their divine progenitors. 
Of the Ss’ressen only males may 
become shamans. </p>

Equipment
You start with the following equipment, in addition to the 
equipment granted by your background. See Chapter IV 
for regional weapons and armor.
• a short bow and 20 arrows or any simple weapon
• a scholar’s pack or an explorer’s pack 
• Leather armor, any simple weapon, and two daggers</p>
<p>Between Worlds                      <br />
You can detect the presence of spirits as well as disturbances 
in the fabric of the spirit realm.
   As an action, you can open your awareness to the Spirit 
Realm. Until the end of your next turn, you know the 
location of any spirit within 60 feet of you that is not 
behind total cover. You know the general intent of any spirit 
that you detect with this ability (e.g., “I sense curiosity”, 
“they mean us harm”, or “they wish to tell us something”). 
 Instead of sensing spirits, you can choose to sense 
spiritual residue in the same area. Spiritual residue is the 
result of strong traumatic events such as murder or torture. 
While you may know the nature of the event, you cannot 
discern any details. In most cases, such spiritual residue 
fades with time, but some extremely traumatic or pivotal 
events leave a permanent stain on a location or item.
You can use this feature a number of times equal to 1 + 
your Charisma modifier. When you finish a long rest, you 
regain all expended uses.
With this heightened sensitivity to the spirit world, you 
mark yourself as more than a common mortal. At all times, 
even when not using this class feature, all spirits within 60 
feet are aware of your presence and know what you are. 
How the spirits will react is completely up to your GM.</p>

<p>Souls and Spirits
On Arcanis, souls and spirits are very distinct from one another. 
A soul is the essence of a living, mortal sentient creature, that some conjecture to be the fount of passion, creativity 
and empathy. The soul’s appearance can reflect the choices made throughout a being’s life, with dark blotches or black 
tumors representing particularly traumatic experiences or actions, while love and other positive events make it shine 
brightly. When separated from the physical, souls migrate towards their consigned afterlife, which for humankind is the 
Cauldron or the Paradise of the Gods. Those who lose their way, or are somehow anchored to the Mortal Realm, manifest 
in a variety of ways, such as ghosts, wraiths, specters, and other incorporeal undead creatures.
Spirits on the other hand, are the essence of non-sentient living or non-living things or places, such as rocks, trees, 
rivers, and mountains. Spirits can also be the manifestation of thoughts or ideals that numerous peoples have invested 
belief in over time to give it form. Examples of this can be the spirit of the warrior, the caregiver, or other abstract concepts. 
For centuries, Yhing hir shamans have venerated the spirits of the plains, large rivers, mountain peaks, and even animals. 
Scholars conjecture that these manifestations are the result of people believing in these spirits over so many years, that they 
somehow willed them into existence. Shamans scoff at this idea, saying that the spirits have existed long before mankind 
arrived upon the shores of the Known Lands and will be here long after the last human has taken his final breath.
Events can also leave a spiritual imprint if it was traumatic or eventful. Examples of this can be a battlefield where 
thousands of lives were lost, a blood drenched altar where many were sacrificed over the years, or a memorial where 
a person is venerated or remembered. In the latter case, while the spirit may manifest to look and sound like the 
person remembered, the actual soul is long gone and presumably in the Cauldron. The spirit that appears reflects the 
expectations presumed by those imbuing it with the power to manifest.
Beltinian priests believe that the land of spirits or the Spirit Realm lies like a shroud upon the Mortal Realm, with most 
of the denizens of either unaware of each other’s presence. There are a few, such as shamans and certain priests, who 
can pull back the caul and peer into the other side. The Beltinians believe that all souls must pass through the Spirit 
Realm before reaching the Cauldron. In fact, there are some apocryphal texts that call the surrounding area leading to the 
entrance to the Cauldron the Grey Wastes and places them adjacent and connected to the Spirit Realm.
Souls that are lost and endlessly wander the Grey Wastes eventually lose their sense of self becoming mindless echoes 
of what they were. Could an accumulation of these spirits over time eventually become what the barbaric shamans know 
as lesser spirits? The Spirit Realm is a vast and unknown region whose secrets have yet to be plumbed.
Pact Magic                              <br />
Your pacts with spirits have bestowed upon you the ability 
to cast spells.
Cantrips
You know any two cantrips of your choice from the shaman 
spell list. You learn additional shaman cantrips of your 
choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known 
column of the Shaman table.
Spell Slots
The Spell Slots column of the Shaman table shows how 
many spell slots you have. The Slot Level column of the 
same table shows what the caster level of those slots is; all 
of your spell slots are the same level. To cast one of your 
shaman spells of 1<sup>st</sup> level or higher, you must expend a spell 
slot. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a 
short or long rest.
For example, when you are 5<sup>th</sup> level, you have two 3<sup>rd</sup>-
level spell slots. To cast the 1<sup>st</sup>-level spell unseen servant, 
you must spend one of those slots, and you cast it as a 
3<sup>rd</sup>-level spell.</p>
<p>Spells Known of 1<sup>st</sup> Level and Higher
At 1<sup>st</sup> level, you know two 1<sup>st</sup>-level spells of your choice 
from the shaman spell list.
The Spells Known column of The Shaman Table shows 
when you learn more shaman spells of your choice of 1<sup>st</sup> 
level and higher. A spell you choose must be of a level no 
higher than what’s shown in the table’s Slot Level column 
for your level. When you reach 6<sup>th</sup> level, for example, you 
learn a new shaman spell, which can be 1<sup>st</sup>, 2<sup>nd</sup>, or 3<sup>rd</sup> 
level.
Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can 
choose one of the shaman spells you know and replace it 
with another spell from the shaman spell list, which also 
must be of a level for which you have spell slots.
Spellcasting Ability
Charisma is the spellcasting ability for your shaman spells. 
You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your 
spellcasting ability. Also, you use your Charisma modifier 
when setting the saving throw DC for a shaman spell you 
cast and when making an attack roll with one.
Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + 
your Charisma modifier
Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + 
your Charisma modifier</p>
<p>Arc anis 5e • Chap ter 2: Cl a sse s 152</p>
<p>Spellcasting Focus
You can use a primal focus as a spellcasting focus for your 
shaman spells.
Geas &amp; Taboos 
When you start your spiritual journey, you gain the 
patronage of a powerful spirit. Later, you also gain the favor 
of many lesser spirits. Spirits always demand something 
from you as their power always comes at a price. 
Spirit patrons are the most demanding, imposing a taboo, 
which requires strict adherence. Not doing so, or showing 
disrespect to your patron, may cause your spirit patron or 
lesser spirits to punish or abandon you, usually at a very 
inconvenient time. Angering your spirit patron may result 
in either losing spell slots or your shaman class features 
depending on the severity of the infraction. 
Lesser spirits who grant boons may also impose a geas 
that requires strict adherence. Betraying a lesser spirit’s geas 
denies you their boon, or in extreme cases the loss of their 
talisman. 
Regaining the attention and good will of your patron or a 
lesser spirit can commonly be completed by praying during 
a long rest. Severe infractions or repeated infractions with 
apparent disregard for the spirit’s demands, will require 
more effort.
Atonement for a broken taboo requires a sacrifice of 
goods (fine wine, food, livestock, etc&hellip;) in the amount of 
10 gp per shaman level plus prayers, purification and fasting 
over a period of two days per shaman level.
Atonement for a broken geas requires a sacrifice of goods 
in the amount of 5 gp per shaman level plus prayers, 
purification, and fasting lasting five days.
Spiritual Patron<br />
At 1<sup>st</sup> level, you forge a bond with a powerful spiritual 
patron. The nature of your relationship with your patron 
is up to you. Your spiritual patron may be a demanding or 
jealous spirit constantly requiring small tokens of respect, 
it may act as an advisor, teacher, and ally in the spiritual 
world. Your patron’s characteristics are as unique as you are, 
sometimes manifesting as an animal or particular element.
Each spirit patron grants you a gift and offers to teach 
you specific spells, which are added to your known spells. 
Your patron also negotiates with lesser spirits on your 
behalf, but these gifts come with a cost. Each patron also 
possesses a taboo that you must respect.
Each spirit patron is represented by a sigil, totem, or 
similar device that you must always carry with you. This 
symbol is your link to your spirit patron and acts as a 
primal focus.</p>
<p>Spiritual Patrons 
Jeggal Sag<br />
Racial Restriction: Ss&rsquo;ressen shamans may only choose 
Jeggal Sag as their patron. Jeggal Sag has no interest in 
taking on shamans from other races.
Typical Appearance: A ghostly representation of an 
immense copper scaled dragon
Though Jeggal Sag appears to his followers as a spirit in 
the form of an immense copper dragon in both dreams and 
visions, Jeggal Sag has a physical form buried beneath an 
ancient mound in the territory claimed by the Ssethregoran 
Empire. Jeggal Sag is believed to be the offspring of 
Kassegore and Yig, the once great gods of the reptilian 
ssethrics. Jeggal Sag was mortally wounded during the 
Dragon War, but before he could be killed by the angelic 
Valinor, the beasts of the world interposed themselves to 
protect the fallen dragon. Eventually, the Disciples of Jeggal 
Sag, as his followers are called, built an earthen mound to 
protect his slumbering body. The mound eventually became 
a holy site to all of his disciples and they are expected to 
travel to there at least once in their lifetime. 
Talisman of Jeggal Sag: You possess a talisman unqiue 
to the Disciples of Jeggal Sag. A flat disc with the stylized 
representation of five talons arranged in a semi-circle. Many 
see it more of a holy symbol than a talisman or fetish used 
by other shamans, this talisman acts as a primal spellcasting 
focus.
Protect the Beasts (Taboo): You protect beasts from 
harm, be it a from a natural disaster or indiscriminate 
hunters who hunt for sport. Hunting for food is permissible, 
as this is the natural order of the world. This taboo does not 
mean you cannot defend yourself against beasts, but you 
will attempt to avoid combat and attack only if the beast 
attacks first.
Additional Spells
Jeggal Sag offers to teach you the following spells. These 
spells are added to your spells known as you advance in level.

<p>The Nurturer Spirit 
The Nurturer is common to many cultures that venerate 
primal spirits. She is venerated as the protector of women, 
prayed to during childbirth, and turned to when grief or 
pain is too overwhelming. 
In the Hinterlands, Sushka, the Bearer is seen as the 
Nurturer spirit of the Yhing hir appearing as a visibly 
pregnant woman. For the undir, Mima Aneis, (mima is 
Unden for mother) is their Nurturer spirit. Mima Aneis 
commonly manifests as a kindly and matronly undir 
woman of a sad mien. Undir legend explains that this is due 
to the loss of her son, King Crow. 
Do No Harm unto Others (Taboo): You respect all 
life, you will not instigate combat or any action that 
would lead to the harm of others. Causing emotional or 
psychological harm also falls under this taboo. Exceptions 
to this taboo includes hunting and acting in self-defense. 
Even when forced to fight you will attempt to use the least 
force necessary to subdue or render a foe unable to attack 
you or your allies. Torture or executions of the helpless is 
strictly forbidden. This taboo does not extend to unnatural 
creatures, such as elementals, undead, constructs, and 
infernals. 
Additional Spells
The Nurturer spirit offers to teach you the following 
spells. These spells are added to your spells known as you

Nurturer&rsquo;s Touch 
You can heal wounds with a touch. You have a pool of 
healing power that replenishes when you take a long rest. 
With that pool, you can restore a total number of hit points 
equal to your shaman level × 5. As an action, you can 
touch a creature and draw power from the pool to restore a 
number of hit points to that creature, up to the maximum 
amount remaining in your pool. This feature has no effect 
on undead and constructs.</p>
<p>The Prince of Night 
The Prince of Night is unique to the undir spiritual 
pantheon. He is the wizened, old man that has paid for his 
vast knowledge and wisdom with his youth and vitality. 
Sometimes called Terrible Grandfather, the Prince of Night 
is a powerful patron that can guide those who seek to 
uncover hidden truths and lost knowledge. Often equated 
to an amalgam of the human deities Althares and Cadic, 
the Prince of Night is neither, though he shares the God 
of Knowledge’s unquenchable thirst for information, his 
province is the blackest night, not the shadows, like the 
patron deity of assassins. Some believe that the “darkness” 
is a metaphor for ignorance, but some of the gifts granted 
by this spirit seem to suggest that it is more than a 
euphemism. 
Like their patron, Dacoi of this spirit are voracious in the 
hunger for knowledge, but miserly in sharing it with others. 
Dacoi with this patron are often sought out by the undir 
who crave for the Prince’s wisdom, but know that whatever 
nuggets they can wrest from the Dacoi, it is never the whole 
story. These shamans firmly believe that their hard-won 
knowledge is on a need-to-know basis. 
   Racial Restriction: the Prince of Night is only available 
to undir, and the Prince of Night has no interest in taking 
on shamans from other races.
Whispers and Secrets (Taboo): You must keep 
whatever secret is entrusted to you. When told something 
in confidence, you must not break it, even in the direst of 
situations. Secrets uncovered and known are your currency, 
meant to be used to garner favors or to destroy your 
enemies. You must sell this knowledge dearly, even to your 
friends and allies.

<p>Arc anis 5e • Chap ter 2: Cl a sse s 154</p>
<p>Ulumai Pantheon
Even before the arrival of the kio, the undir had a robust civilization that, while composed of various tribes scattered 
across a large swath of land, was nevertheless vibrant and consistent in its customs. Their religious practices center 
around venerating a pantheon of spirits they call the ulumai or the Family. This pantheon consists of the following spirits:
Dida Govet The Provider, Protector of Sailors, father figure, and Spirit of the Ocean.
Mima Aneis Fertility spirit, Guardian of Lovers, mother figure, and Spirit of Rivers and Lakes.
The Prince of Night Keeper of Secrets, the Wise Man, Spirit of the Darkness.
Chaldur The Tempest, wrathful spirit, and Spirit of the Winds.
Melkie Guardian of the Dead, He Who Intercedes, Whisper from the Barrow
Sai The Trickster Spirit, Spirit of Cunning, She Who Pokes the Bear, The Diviner
The ulumai were once led by a powerful spirit known as the Crow King, but he appears to have fallen from favor, as the 
modern undir no longer include him in their prayers. The ulumai are opposed by the &ldquo;ghede&rdquo;, a group of evil spirits that 
Mother Church priests believe represent infernals that invaded the undir lands during the Time of Terror, but the undir 
shamans shake their heads at these more learned clerics. 
The shamans of the undir are known as Dacoi and can be either male or female. Dacoi enjoy a high social status 
within the clan and are the only ones who may contradict the clan leader without fear of reprisal. Most Dacoi are seen as 
benevolent figures within the undir community, fashioning good luck charms, love potions, wards against evil spirits, and 
general advice on life. Some Dacoi turn to the power offered by the ghede to harm or work against the general welfare of 
the undir people, but these are far and few between and are quickly ostracized or hunted down for their malevolent acts.
As is their wont, when they first encountered the undir, the Coryani equated the primitive people’s spiritual pantheon 
to the deities of the Pantheon of Man, seeing the Prince of Night as Cadic, Dida Govet as a Illiir, Sai as Larissa and so on. 
Wisely, the dacoi chose not to contradict the powerful Coryani and allow them to believe what they wished. 
Ironically the average undir and Coryani citizen have much in common. Both worship a pantheon of deities, and 
while they may have a favored or patron deity or spirit, they venerate and ask for blessings from the entirety, depending 
on their situation. When embarking on an ocean voyage, both ask for protection from the deity that governs the 
waters, or when going into battle, they may ask for the blessings of their warrior spirits. Nevertheless, even the undir 
recognize that the Coryani are favored by Gods and that those Gods are far more powerful than their own pantheon of 
spirits. While this is enticed some of the newer generations of undir to turn their back on the old ways and emulate the 
Coryani customs and religious practices, the majority who live in rural communities still venerate the ulumai and offer 
sacrifices and prayers in their name.
The Trickster<br />
The Trickster is a cunning and intelligent spirit, who 
values cleverness and the intellect over brute strength. It is 
always challenging the status quo, never content to leave 
things well enough alone. Mischievous, but not evil or 
malicious, the Trickster finds humor in even the grimmest 
of situations, albeit a dark one. Oddly, the Trickster is also 
seen as a teacher, striving to bestow wisdom through lessons 
that only the most fortunate survive. 
In the Hinterlands, Chok’ti represents the Trickster spirit 
and appears as a large wolf lizard, a large quadruped reptile 
resembling an iguana which hunts in packs like wolves. 
They are admired by the Yhing hir as cunning and clever 
beasts. For the undir, Sai is their Trickster spirit, appearing 
as a young, waifish maiden with a mischievous grin, or at 
times, a seductive smile. Undir shamans chosen by Sai are 
often seduced by the spirit, with the dacoi often seeing the 
spirit as a demanding lover that must be appeased by both 
word and deed. Sai may grant her dacoi with visions of the 
past and the near future, making these shamans welcome at 
the side of any undir chieftain. 
Curiosity &amp; Chaos (Taboo): You must always strive to 
uncover the truth in any situation, or uncover those things </p>
<p>that others want to be forgotten. You cannot turn away 
from undiscovered truths, especially if doing so upsets the 
status quo. Never pass up the opportunity to shake things 
up as stagnation is anathema to the Trickster.

<p>155 Arc anis 5e • Chap ter 2: Cl a sse s</p>
<p>The Warrior<br />
The Warrior spirit embodies strength and aggressiveness. 
Shamans who choose the Warrior as their spiritual patron 
tend to be belligerent and will only submit to the leadership 
of another who has proven to be or is demonstrably the 
greater warrior. 
In the Hinterlands, this spirit is known as the Stallion 
and manifests as a large and imposing black horse with fire 
erupting from its eyes and snout. When a Yhing hir fury 
goes berserk, he is said to be “riding the Stallion”, meaning 
that the ferocity of this spirit is raging within their breast. 
These shamans are always welcome at a Yhing hir warlord’s 
council. 
Race Restriction: The undir cannot choose this spiritual 
patron as one no longer exists in the ulumai. 
How the undir lost their warrior spirit
The undir warrior spirit was once known as King Crow, 
who manifested as a powerful, bare chested warrior with 
the head of a crow. Centuries ago, when the undir fell 
under the protection of the kio and the elorii of Entaris, 
a great war was fought between these two elder people 
that resulted in the deaths of many thousands. This war 
was instigated due to the actions of a handful of undir 
tribes under the influence of King Crow. After peace was 
re-established, both the elorii and the kio demanded 
that the undir destroy all the effigies, fetishes and altars 
to this spirit. Those that could not be destroyed were 
buried away in long forgotten crypts and barrows and 
all the remaining dacoi that were touched by King Crow 
entombed with them.</p>
<p>Warrior’s Soul (Taboo): You must never pass up an 
opportunity for combat, though you may execute a tactical 
retreat only if attacking will result in obvious suicide. If 
this is not the situation, you will urge attacking as the most 
viable option to the situation. This does not mean rushing 
in headlong without a plan, as tactics are a warrior’s greatest 
weapon. </p>
<p>Additional Spells
The Warrior offers to teach you the following spells. These 
spells are added to your list of possible spells to learn as you 
advance in level.
The Warrior spells 
Shaman Level Spells
1<sup>st</sup> bless
3<sup>rd</sup> spiritual weapon
5<sup>th</sup> haste
7<sup>th</sup> stoneskin 
9<sup>th</sup> retribution*
Warrior Training 
The Warrior grants you the gift of training with combat 
equipment. You gain proficiency in shields and medium 
armor.
A Warrior’s Talisman 
Beginning at 3<sup>rd</sup> level, you may make a single weapon 
your warrior’s talisman by performing a special ritual 
while holding it. The ritual is performed over the course 
of 1 hour, which can be done during a short rest. Once 
complete, as a bonus action you can ask your patron to store 
your talisman safely within the Spirit Realm. If you are not 
proficient with your chosen weapon, you become so.
As an action, you can call forth your warrior’s talisman, 
making it appear in your hand. Your warrior’s talisman 
acts as a primal focus for you and while you wield it, and 
counts as a magical weapon for the purposes of overcoming 
resistance and immunity to non-magical attacks and 
damage. 
Finally, whenever you travel within the Spirit Realm, 
your warrior’s talisman manifests with you. In the land of 
the spirits, the Warrior’s chosen never goes unarmed. If you 
die, the weapon appears next to your body.</p>
<p>Arc anis 5e • Chap ter 2: Cl a sse s 156</p>
<p>Boons 
As you grow in power, you start to gain the attention 
of spiritual allies who offer to guide you. Each spirit is 
attracted to you by a small talisman or charm that honors 
the spirit and grants you their boon. Should you ever lose 
or are denied access to a talisman or charm, you are denied 
access to that boon, but must still follow the geas associated 
with it. 
Each boon from the spirits has an associated geas that 
usually manifests as a required behavior pattern. Unless 
otherwise stated, the geas must be satisfied at least once per 
week, and if you should fail to do so, you lose the benefits 
of the spirit’s boon until you have atoned. 
Some of the geas imposed by spirits may conflict with 
others. For example, the Cat and Dog spirits demand 
contradictory behaviors. You may select two such boons, 
but because you cannot satisfy them both, you will always 
be atoning for one or the other.
At 2<sup>nd</sup> level, you gain two boons of your choice. These 
boons are detailed at the end of the class description, with 
some boons possessing prerequisites that must be met to 
select it. As you advance in level, you gain additional boons, 
as shown in the boons column of the shaman table. 
Once a boon is selected, it may not be exchanged for 
another. Spirits are jealous things and do not give their 
boons easily. 
Spiritual Path 
At 3<sup>rd</sup> level, you must choose a Spiritual Path: the Dacoi, 
Ehtzara, Spirit Speaker, or Skin-Dancer, each of which 
is detailed at the end of the class description below. Your 
choice grants you features at 3<sup>rd</sup> level and again at 6<sup>th</sup>, 
10<sup>th</sup>, and 14<sup>th</sup> level. 
Path Restrictions: Male ss’ressen who become shamans 
can only select the Skin-Dancer archetype. While undir 
shaman may only choose the path of the Dacoi.
Ability Score Improvement  <br />
When you reach 4<sup>th</sup> level, and again at 8<sup>th</sup>, 12<sup>th</sup>, 16<sup>th</sup>, and 
19<sup>th</sup> level, you can increase one ability score of your choice 
by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice 
by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 
using this feature.
Patron’s Gift                             <br />
At 11<sup>th</sup> level, your patron bestows upon the shaman powerful 
spells called Patron’s Gift. Choose one 6<sup>th</sup>-level spell from 
the shaman spell list as this patron’s gift. You can cast your 
patron’s gift spell once without expending a spell slot. You 
must finish a long rest before you can do so again. At higher 
levels, you gain more shaman spells of your choice that are cast 
in the same way: one 7<sup>th</sup>- level spell at 13<sup>th</sup> level, one 8<sup>th</sup>-level </p>
<p>spell at 15<sup>th</sup> level, and one 9<sup>th</sup>-level spell at 17<sup>th</sup> level. You 
regain all uses of your patron’s gift when you finish a long rest.
Extended Patronage                <br />
At 20<sup>th</sup> level, you can call upon your spiritual patron to 
aid you. You can spend 1 minute entreating your patron 
for aid to regain all your expended spell slots from your 
Pact Magic feature.
Once you have regained spell slots with this feature, you 
may not use it again until you have completed a long rest.
Boons<br />
If a boon has prerequisites, you must meet them to learn 
it. You can learn a boon at the same time that you meet 
its prerequisites. A level prerequisite refers to your level in 
this class.
Badger
Prerequisites: 9<sup>th</sup> level, Warrior spirit patron
When you hit a creature that is below its hit point 
maximum with your pact weapon, you deal additional 
damage equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum 1) of 
the same type as your pact weapon. 
Tenacity (Geas): The badger doesn’t always start fights 
but is always determined to end them. While engaging 
an enemy in combat, you will continue to attempt to do 
damage to that enemy every round over healing or casting 
beneficial spells on yourself or party members.
Bear
Any time you cast a spell of 1<sup>st</sup> level or higher that restores 
hit points to a creature, you restore additional hit points 
equal to your Charisma modifier. Spells that create items 
that restore hit points, such as goodberry, are not affected by 
this boon. 
Protector of the Weak (Geas): While bears can be 
ferocious, the spirit of Bear is benevolent. She is a healer 
and mother, and her lesson to the shaman is that all beings 
have a time when they need help or comfort. You may never 
strike a helpless creature. Additionally, you must always 
protect children and those unable to defend themselves.
Butterfly
You can cast disguise self at will, without expending a spell 
slot.
Mistaken Identity (Geas): You may never reveal your 
identity. You always assume a false identity. If your true 
identity is discovered or revealed, this geas is broken.
Chameleon
Prerequisites: 7<sup>th</sup> level.
You can cast polymorph, at a level equal to your pact magic 
spell slot, using a shaman spell slot. You cannot do so again 
until you finish a long rest.</p>
<p>157 Arc anis 5e • Chap ter 2: Cl a sse s</p>
<p>Mimic (Geas): The Chameleon will mimic the 
personalities of those around it. If the consensus of the 
group you are adventuring with is to take a particular 
action, you will not object to it.
Cat
Prerequisites: 3<sup>rd</sup> level.
You gain proficiency in Acrobatics and Stealth. If you are 
already proficient, your proficiency bonus is doubled for 
ability checks that use these skills.
Independent (Geas): Cat teaches that each creature 
must be independent, free from an oppressive overseer or 
superior. The shaman who accepts Cat’s gift also learns the 
lesson of independence, and thus may never be a member 
of a hierarchical organization that demands obedience. This 
geas includes a ban on belonging to a secret society.
If you are already a member of such an organization when 
you choose this spirit gift, you must leave the organization. 
If leaving would endanger your life, such as leaving specific 
secret societies, you may remain a member but must give 
up any but the most basic level of membership. Afterwards, 
you no longer feel the need to accept jobs or report to the 
organization. This may lead to the organization kicking you 
out, of course, but such is life.
Crow
Prerequisites: 5<sup>th</sup> level; Prince of Night
You can now cast any shaman spell with the ritual tag 
that you know as a ritual.
Additionally, you may choose two 1<sup>st</sup> level spells that 
have the ritual tag from any spell list, which do not need to 
be part of the same spell list. You learn these spells as ritual 
spells; these spells not count against the number of spells 
you know. You can cast these spells only as rituals.
On your adventures, you may learn new ritual spells you 
come across them, either by watching them being cast or 
finding them in some written form. Once witnessed or 
found, and as long as they are of a level equal to or lower 
then your slot level as found on the Shaman table, you may 
spend a short rest as you appeal to your spiritual patron, 
who then teaches you the ritual. After the short rest is 
complete, the ritual has been committed to your memory 
and can never be forgotten. You may know a maximum 
number of ritual spells equal to half your shaman level.
Teacher (Geas): You must always seek to teach those 
around you something about the world or themselves. 
Merely giving a lecture to a group of people does not 
satisfy the geas. The knowledge given must have personal 
significance or serve a useful purpose. It could be as simple 
as educating a fellow traveler on the social customs of 
the Yhing hir, as practical as teaching someone who has 
never been in the wilderness how to build a campfire, or as 
profound as helping someone struggling with their faith to 
find the answer to a religious question.</p>
<p>Dog
Prerequisites: 3<sup>rd</sup> level.
You gain proficiency in Perception. You gain a +5 to your 
passive Perception and can track by scent. If you are already 
proficient, your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability 
checks you make with Perception. 
Loyalty and Obedience (Geas): The lesson Dog teaches 
the shaman is how to be a benefit to his companions 
and superiors. You must join a hierarchical organization, 
or become part of a band in which there is a definite 
designated leader. If you are already a member of such an 
organization, you must commit to the organization totally, 
trying to complete any mission assigned. You will always 
report back to your organization with extra information, 
even if not on a specific mission. Shaman with this gift 
rarely becomes a leader of any organization, instead they are 
content to serve as an advisor.
Dolphin
You have a swim speed of 30 feet, and as a bonus action, 
you may Dash while swimming. Additionally, you can hold 
your breath for a number of rounds equal to double your 
Constitution score. If you are an undir, you gain the ability 
to breathe in water.
Playful (Geas): Dolphin is a playful spirit, always 
joyously ready to riddle or game with his friends and allies. 
You love games of all kinds, and you cannot pass up the 
opportunity to learn or play a new game. Doing so breaks 
this geas.
Dragonfly
Prerequisites: 5<sup>th</sup> level.
You can cast haste, at a level equal to your pact magic 
spell slot once without expending a spell slot or material 
components. You cannot do so again until you finish a 
long rest.
Spreader of Joy (Geas): As dragonfly brings joy to the 
wise, so too does the shaman bring joy to the people of the 
world. You must never wear drab or dark colors, and you 
must strive to bring art and music to people.
You must either create a piece of art or give a musical 
performance in each city, town or village you visit. If you 
create a work of art, you must gift it to someone who 
lives in that location or left in a public place. If you give a 
performance, it must be seen or heard by at least one resident.
Eagle
You can cast heroism, at a level equal to your Pact Magic 
slot level, once without expending a spell slot or material 
components. You cannot do so again until you finish a 
long rest.
Nobility (Geas): You must in all ways maintain a 
dignified demeanor. You must not do anything that would 
be considered foolish or frivolous.</p>
<p>Arc anis 5e • Chap ter 2: Cl a sse s 158</p>
<p>Fire
You can cast burning hands, at a level equal to your Pact 
Magic slot level, once without expending a spell slot or 
material components. You cannot do so again until you 
finish a long rest.
Passion (Geas): You must do all in you power to discover 
and encourage the passions and dreams of those whom you 
meet. Rousing passions and dreams is easily done among 
friends, and so you must look outside of your circle of 
friends and acquaintances to complete this geas.
At least once per month, you must aid one individual 
in fulfilling a passion, which can take the form of offering 
money to help someone start a business, go to a school, or 
even just move. It could also mean spending time helping a 
farmer achieve a good harvest or a forlorn lover find a mate 
(or rekindle an old flame).
Horse
While wearing light or no armor, your base speed in 
increased by 10 feet. You can wield a shield and still benefit 
from this boon.
Freedom (Geas): You long for wide-open spaces and 
must avoid confined spaces whenever possible. For instance, 
if you have an option of sleeping in an inn or outside, you 
will always choose to sleep outside.
Lion
You cannot be frightened.
Leadership (Geas): You lead by actions, not words. 
Whether it’s taking the point position in a march, or being 
the first to introduce herself to others, you should always 
lead by example. You always present an exemplary and 
dignified demeanor. The Lion is not a buffoon, and neither 
should you be.
Owl
Prerequisites: Prince of Night
You have advantage on all (Intelligence)  History and 
(Intelligence) Nature checks. 
Introspection (Geas): You must spend an additional hour 
each day meditating upon your inner world, seeking to gain 
a better understanding of your motivations and being. 
Additionally, you should share some aspect of your 
internal life with one of your companions, usually by 
revealing some secret part of your soul or psyche. This secret 
could be as simple as confessing love for another, or as 
complex as explaining your motivations for taking part in 
a given mission. These confessions are meant to help others 
think about, or consider, their own inner worlds.
Rabbit
You can cast jump on yourself at will, without expending a 
spell slot or material components.</p>
<p>Humility (Geas): Rabbit teaches you to accept that 
each person is valuable and that all are equal. To think 
of yourself as greater than others goes against Rabbit’s 
teachings. You may never boast about your exploits or be 
prideful of your abilities.
Also, you must initially decline all visible awards or 
honors that are offered (such as medals, trophies, etc.). If 
the individual presenting the award/honor insists, or if it 
would give serious offense to refuse, then you may accept. 
This geas does not prevent you from becoming a leader of a 
group, but you will not boast about your leadership.
Raccoon
You can choose the ability to speak a language (you are 
not literate in this language, just possess the ability to 
understand and speak it, if you are capable) and one skill to 
be proficient with at the start of the day. You may change 
both the language and skill chosen after a long rest.
Curiosity (Geas): The Raccoon is always curious of its 
environment. You will fidget with objects around you, 
touching things that perhaps you shouldn’t.
Shadow Lion
Prerequisites: 6<sup>th</sup> level, Warrior patron
While wielding your warrior’s talisman, you can attack 
twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action 
on your turn.
Bravery (Geas): You must always participate in battle, 
never hiding from your duty to fight for friends and family. 
This geas does not prohibit you from using your magic 
during combat. 
You may not leave the field of battle until victorious or 
all of your companions have safely escaped (in other words, 
you must be the last one to flee; you can flee if that is 
obviously the right course of action).
Spider
Prerequisites: Trickster patron
You gain the ability to look into the webs of fate and 
rewrite the future. After completing a long rest, roll a d20 
and record the result. You may choose to use that result in 
place of any one attack roll, saving throw, or ability check 
you make with that result. You lose any unspent result after 
you complete a long rest. Additionally, if you do not have 
proficiency in an artisan tool, you gain proficiency in the 
artisan tool of your choice.
Creative (Geas): Spider teaches that the act of creation 
brings us closer to the divine but also that creativity must 
be shared and fostered. As each person expresses their 
creativity, all people grow closer to the divine and less 
constrained by their own fears.
Once per week, you must create an artistic item through 
a handicraft, such as knitting, sewing, weaving, carving, 
etc. This item must then be given away to an individual 
who can make use of it.</p>
<p>159 Arc anis 5e • Chap ter 2: Cl a sse s</p>
<p>Stone
You can cast false life on yourself at will as a 1<sup>st</sup>-level spell, 
without expending a spell slot or material components.
Stalwart (Geas): Stone teaches you that the stalwart 
companion is the greatest of all gifts. You must provide 
some form of aid to every companion you are traveling with 
when the opportunity presents itself. While this could be 
as simple as healing them or lending them money, you are 
encouraged to find something more meaningful to show 
that you are a stalwart companion.
Turtle
While you are not wearing any armor, your Armor 
Class equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + 
your Constitution modifier. You can use a shield and still 
gain this benefit.
Conservation (Geas): The Turtle teaches you to conserve 
your energies. You will always seek the efficient way to 
achieve your goal. On long marches, you will insist on 
sitting in the back of a wagon, use your magic to light camp 
fires or warm your food or pay others to do the most menial 
of tasks. In combat you fight in the most efficient way 
possible, always seeking to end the battle quickly.
Vulture
Prerequisites: 7<sup>th</sup> level 
When you reduce a hostile creature to 0 hit points, as a 
reaction you can consume part of its spiritual essence, and 
gain temporary hit points equal to 5 + your Charisma 
modifier. These temporary hit points fade after 1 hour. 
Waste Not (Geas): Vulture does not waste any part of the 
kill. You must take a piece of those fallen foes from your 
battles if time permits. This could be an item or a piece of 
the creature; the vulture doesn’t differentiate between flesh 
and steel. 
Water
You can cast riptide*, at a level equal to your Pact Magic 
slot level, once without expending a spell slot or material 
components. You cannot do so again until you finish a long 
rest.
Fluidity (Geas): You may never permanently take a rigid 
stance on any topic. You must always be willing to hear all 
sides of an argument.
You must also demonstrate your fluid nature occasionally, 
by changing your stance on a given topic or course of 
action. This change must be a true commitment, and not 
merely playing the devil’s advocate.
Wolf
Once per turn, you gain advantage on any one attack with a 
weapon attack or cantrip if that creature is within 5 feet of 
an ally that isn’t incapacitated.</p>
<p>Tactician (Geas): Wolf teaches you the safety of the pack 
is always foremost, and to waste the pack on a meaningless 
fight is foolish. You must look for all possible ways to avoid 
a fight.
You cannot hold back once a fight begins. You must 
be an active participant, seeking to put down the enemy 
and ensure the safety of your pack. You are not prohibited 
from healing companions during a fight, but you cannot 
hang back and wait for the situation to develop – you must 
engage the enemy and seek to win the day for your pack.
Spiritual Paths 
Shamans devote themselves to specific groups of spirits and 
ways of interacting with the spirit world. They refine and 
focus their efforts, always looking for a deeper connection 
with the spirits that give them power.
Dacoi 
Most of the undir believe ardently in the protector spirits 
that watch over them, offering the spirits each their favored 
sacrifice of fruits, burnt offerings, and blood to please them. 
With the coming of the Coryani Empire to their shores, 
the Pantheon of Man was somehow merged with the spirits 
in the local undir religion. Dacoi are undir shamans who 
practice the Old Ways, and pay homage to this strange 
amalgam of spirits and Gods.
Race Restrictions
Only undir may choose this spiritual paths. Undir shaman 
are the only shaman which may follow this spiritual path. 
Geas and Taboo
The Dacoi pay homage to the spirits in a unique way that 
draws on both their animistic heritage and the prayers and 
rituals of the Pantheon of Man. When you take this path 
at 3<sup>rd</sup> level, whenever you pass by a temple or shrine to the 
Pantheon of Man, you must leave an offering of some kind 
and spend a moment in prayer.
Expanded Spell List
As a dacoi, you choose from an expanded list of spells when 
you learn a shaman spell. The following spells are added to 
the shaman spell list for you.

<p>Blessings and Curses
At 3<sup>rd</sup> level, the spirits teach you how to bring both good 
fortune and misery. 
You learn the spells bane and bless. These spells are 
added to your list of spells known, and they are considered 
shaman spells when you cast them.
Powerful Blessings and Curses 
At 6<sup>th</sup> level, you master the art of weal and woe. 
Whenever you cast bane or bless, the die that a creature 
rolls due to the spell is increased to a d6.
Sanctification
At 10<sup>th</sup> level, you learn a unique ritual, formed from the 
knowledge from your spiritual patron. 
You can cast hallow as a ritual. When cast in this 
way, you can expend an additional 500 gp of material 
components (incense, herbs, fruit, and grains) for one 
of the following options:
• Increase the radius of the area affected by 
the spell to 120 feet
• Bind a second extra effect into the 
area of the spell
• Impose disadvantage on 
a creature’s Charisma 
saving throw to resist 
extra effects bound 
to the area of the 
spell
• Impose 
disadvantage 
on the ability 
check a creature 
makes when 
they attempt 
to affect the 
spell with dispel 
magic.
At 18<sup>th</sup> level, you 
can select two of 
these options by 
expending an 
additional 1,000 
gp in material 
components. You 
cannot select the 
same option twice.
Once you use 
this feature, you 
cannot use it again 
until you complete 
a long rest. </p>
<p>Bountiful Blessings
At 14<sup>th</sup> level, blessing and cursing creatures have become 
second nature to you. 
A number of times equal to your Charisma modifier, 
you can cast either bane or bless without expending a spell 
slot. You regain all expended uses of this feature when you 
complete a long rest.
The Ehtzara<br />
The Ehtzara are the mystic sorcerers of the Hinterlands 
who gain power and learn spells from summoned spirits 
and gain innate knowledge of the natural landscape and 
its denizens. They are a mix of three ancient traditions: 
the original Yhing hir beliefs of ancestor worship before 
they were trapped in the Hinterlands, the pagan elemental 
practices of the indigenous Pengik tribe, and 
the amalgamations of southern magic, 
superstitions, and religious beliefs.
The training and discipline for the 
Ehtzara is rigorous, and an initiate 
of this group must accept that 
they will no longer be treated 
as normal and often not 
even as natural. They 
are imbued with 
many useful and 
devastatingly effective 
capabilities, however, 
and they command 
respect and fear from 
all they encounter.
Like most shamans 
in the Known 
Lands, the Ehtzara 
are no exception to the 
misconception that they deal 
with demons and devils to 
grant them power, and they are 
ascribed with every malicious 
act or freak occurrence 
around them for miles. The 
difference with the Ehtzara 
is that they embrace this 
superstition, use their 
frightful presence and 
ominous reputations to 
intimidate others and 
chase off would-be 
attackers or angry mobs. 
The sinister Ehtzara 
who lead the heretical 
Cult of the Jackal in the 
deserts of the Hinterlands </p>
<p>161 Arc anis 5e • Chap ter 2: Cl a sse s</p>
<p>have earned their malicious reputation. Not all Ehtzara are 
evil, though, and many live on the edge of communities, 
giving assistance or help in return for payment, food and 
shelter, as well as a blind eye to their unseemly trade. They 
tend to wayward shrines and forgotten cairns to learn ancient 
lore and appease their spirit patrons.
Race Restrictions
 Ss’ressen and undir may not choose this archetype. 
Note: The Ehtzara Path first appeared in Forged in Magic: 
Reforged. The rules here replace that presentation of the 
Ehtzara.
Geas and Taboos
At 3<sup>rd</sup> level, you make a small personal traveling shrine or 
altar, inscribed with the names of your most powerful spirit 
patrons. You must spend time in meditative communion 
at dawn or dusk to appease your patrons. This communion 
involves sacrificing gifts such as honey, wine, rich foods, 
herbs, gems, or blood (depending on the spirits you wish to 
appease) on holy days, important events, and even before or 
after great undertakings.
If the shrine is stolen, defiled, or damaged, you must craft 
a new one (requiring a week and 300 gp in materials and 
sacrifices). Until you replace your old shrine, you cannot 
recover spell slots and cast all cantrips as if you were 5 levels 
lower (minimum of 1<sup>st</sup> level). This reduction lasts until you 
make a new shrine.
Additionally, you must tend to neglected altars, shrines, 
and icons that you come across, regardless of the religious 
beliefs of those who created the shrine. You must show 
them the proper respect, such as righting a fallen icon, 
dusting off or pulling weeds from a shrine, or simply 
bowing or leaving a tithe as you pass.
Spiritual Etiquette 
At 3<sup>rd</sup> level, your time dealing with the spirits 
grants you advantage on all Wisdom (Insight) and 
Charisma (Persuasion) checks when dealing with them. 
Additionally, you may, at the GM’s discretion, roll an 
Intelligence check to recall the name and reputation of 
particularly powerful spirits.
To use this feature, you must abide by this additional 
geas: You must bow and give the proper respect when in 
the presence of any spirits. This geas does not mean you 
cannot defend yourself against such creatures, but you will 
usually try to avoid combat and attack only if the creature 
in question attacks first.
Expanded Spell List
As an Ehtzara, you choose from an expanded list of spells 
when you learn a shaman spell. The following spells are 
added to the shaman spell list for you.</p>

Spirit Robes 
Also at 3<sup>rd</sup> level, you create your first true fetish, your 
spirit robe. This robe is black with a tasseled hood or cowl 
with the hems adorned with the names of your spirit 
patron in silver thread.
Once created, your spirit robe becomes permanently 
bound to you. When donned, it must never be taken off 
except at dusk or dawn while performing a special prayer.
While you wear your robes and no other armor, you 
have an AC of 13 + your Dexterity modifier. You can 
wield a shield and still gain this benefit.
Bind Spirit Fetish
At 6<sup>th</sup> level, you learn how to create a unique kind of fetish, 
a spirit fetish, as a downtime activity. Spirit fetishes are 
the same as regular fetishes but require a personal bond, a 
special deal between you and the spirits. 
You cannot give a spirit fetish to someone else nor let 
anyone take it from you; if anyone else handles one, it 
crumbles to dust. You can craft a spirit fetish only if you 
adhere to your taboos and spiritual etiquette. Crafting a 
spirit fetish requires spending time and making sacrifices, 
as per the Create Spirit Fetish table. You must also meet a 
minimum level requirement, as shown in the same table.
You may have up to two spirit fetishes at a time (your 
spirit robes do not count as one of these fetishes). If you 
want to create another spirit fetish while you already have 
two, you must choose one to destroy.
Also, when you create regular fetishes, the creation cost is 
halved.
See Appendix 2 for a selection of fetishes. You can also 
find a full listing of fetishes in Forged in Magic: Reforged 
Chapter 4: Fetishes.

<p>Elemental Adept 
Starting at 10<sup>th</sup> level, your study of elemental traditions 
opens new avenues of knowledge. You may add any 2 spells 
from the eldritch sorcerer spell list to your spells known. 
These spells must be of a spell level for which you have slots 
and must deal either acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder 
damage.
Enriched Aura
Starting at 14<sup>th</sup> level, your understanding of spirits has 
opened your mind to new possibilities.
While wearing a fetish with a limited number of uses, 
you can activate the fetish without expending one of its 
charges or uses.
You can use this ability three times, regaining all 
expended uses after completing a long rest.
Skin Dancer<br />
Most commonly found in the Hinterlands, Skin Dancers 
venerate bestial spirits above all others. They honor the 
beasts they hunt by wearing their pelts and creating 
personalized talismans. These talismans allow the Skin 
Dancer to call upon the physical might of beasts and even 
take on their forms. </p>
<p>Training to become a Skin Dancer is a highly personal 
affair. Elders teach new Skin Dancers the basics of the hunt 
and how to properly honor their spirits but then send them 
out to learn the rest on their own. A Skin Dancer’s first 
encounter with beasts commonly leave them scarred, badges 
of honor they wear proudly.
Ss’ressen who follow the path of the Skin Dancer are 
Disciples of Jeggal Sag and can only seek the skin of 
reptiles and amphibians, preferring to take on the shapes of 
alligators, crocodiles, frogs, and wolf lizards. 
Geas and Taboos
Show respect for all beasts. Though you are master of the 
hunt, it is the beasts that provide the flesh you eat and the 
skin you wear. Thank the departing spirits for their gifts 
since they do not give them willingly. Remember that 
although you are the hunter, you may also become prey. 
Expanded Spell List
As a Skin Dancer, you choose from an expanded list of 
spells when you learn a shaman spell. The following spells 
are added to the shaman spell list for you.</p>
<p>Shape Changing
When you change into a creature, the following rules apply:
Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the creature you are changing into, but you retain your personality, 
and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You also retain all of your skill and saving throw proficiencies, in 
addition to gaining those of the creature. If the creature has the same proficiency as you and the bonus in its stat block is 
higher than yours, use the creature’s bonus instead of yours. If the creature has any legendary or lair actions, you cannot 
use them.
When you transform, you assume the creature’s hit points and Hit Dice. When you revert to your normal form, you 
return to the number of hit points you had before you transformed. However, if you revert as a result of dropping to 0 hit 
points, any excess damage carries over to your normal form. For example, if you take 10 damage in animal form and have 
only 1 hit point left, you revert and take 9 damage. As long as the excess damage doesn’t reduce your normal form to 0 
hit points, you are not knocked unconscious.
If you change into a creature that cannot speak or that has no hands, you cannot cast spells, and your ability to speak or 
take any action that requires hands is limited to the capabilities of your form. Transforming doesn’t break your concentration 
on a spell you’ve already cast, however, or prevent you from taking actions that are part of a spell, such as call lightning, that 
you’ve already cast.
You retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other source and can use them if the new form is 
physically capable of doing so. However, you can’t use any of your special senses, such as darkvision, unless your new 
form also has that sense.
You choose whether your equipment falls to the ground in your space, merges into your new form, or is worn by it. 
Worn equipment functions as normal, but the GM decides whether it is practical for the new form to wear a piece of 
equipment, based on the creature’s shape and size. Your equipment doesn’t change size or shape to match the new 
form, and any equipment that the new form can’t wear must either fall to the ground or merge with it. Equipment that 
merges with the form has no effect until you leave the form.</p>

Beast Speak
Starting at 3<sup>rd</sup> level, you gain the ability to cast speak with 
animals at will without expending a spell slot. If you already 
possess the ability to speak with animals, you instead gain 
advantage on all Charisma based skill checks when dealing 
with beasts.
Honoring the Beast
When you join this path at 3<sup>rd</sup> level, you learn a 1-hour 
ritual to honor the spirit of a beast you have slain and 
skinned. You must perform this ritual at sunrise, and 
once it is complete, you gain the ability to call upon the 
beast’s spirit and even take their form. Beasts that you 
have honored in this way can be used for your other class 
features from this path. 
Bestial Form
When you join this path at 3<sup>rd</sup> level, you can use your 
bonus action to magically assume the shape of a beast that 
you have honored with your Honoring the Beast feature. 
The beast must have a challenge rating of 1 or lower and 
cannot have a flying or swimming speed. You can use this 
feature three times. You regain expended uses when you 
finish a long rest.
You can stay in a beast shape for a number of hours equal 
to half your shaman level (rounded down). You then revert 
to your normal form unless you expend another use of this 
feature. You can revert to your normal form earlier by using 
a bonus action on your turn. You automatically revert if you 
fall unconscious, drop to 0 hit points, or die.
For details of your transformation see Shape Changing 
side on the previous page.
Beast Spirit Blessings
Starting at 6<sup>th</sup> level, you gain more power from the spirits 
you have honored.
When you use your Bestial Form feature, you may 
now take on the form of beasts with flying or swimming 
speeds. Additionally, you may now take the form of a 
beast whose challenge rating is equal to half your shaman 
level (rounded down) or lower. You must still honor a </p>
<p>particular beast with your Honoring the Beasts feature 
before you can take on its form. 
Also, your attacks while in bestial form now count as 
magical attacks for the purposes of overcoming resistance 
and immunity to non-magical attacks. 
Power of the Beast
Starting at 10<sup>th</sup> level, you can call upon the skills of the 
beasts you have honored. 
During a short or long rest, you may beseech the spirit 
of a beast you have honored with your Honoring the Beast 
feature. At the end of the rest, you may choose to either 
become proficient with a skill possessed by that beast or 
replace either your Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution 
score with that of the beast, as long as that score is higher 
than your own. If you choose to increase your Constitution, 
any additional hit points you gain are temporary hit points 
that fade away when this effect ends. 
You retain the skill or ability score of your chosen beast 
for a number of hours equal to half your shaman level 
(rounded down). You may end this effect early as a bonus 
action. 
Into the Beast 
At 16<sup>th</sup> level, you gain the ability to possess beasts and 
monstrosities for a short time. 
Choose one beast or monstrosity that you can see within 
30 feet. The chosen creature must succeed on a Charisma 
saving throw (using your spell save DC) or become 
possessed by you. You leap into the creature’s body and 
disappear, becoming a spirit in control of the creature for 
1 minute. The creature is incapacitated for the duration of 
this effect.
You now control the creature’s body but don’t deprive it 
of its awareness. You cannot be targeted by any attack, spell, 
or another effect, except ones that affect spirits. 
You retain your Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma, and any 
immunity to being charmed and frightened. For everything 
else, you use the statistics and abilities of the creature you 
are possessing, but you don’t gain access to the creature’s 
knowledge or proficiencies. 
Your possession of the creature ends when the duration 
ends, if the creature’s body drops to 0 hit points, if you end 
your possession as a bonus action, or if you are turned or 
forced out by an effect like the dispel evil and good spell. 
When your possession ends, you reappear in an 
unoccupied space within 5 feet of the creature’s body. The 
creature you possessed becomes immune to this ability for 
24 hours after succeeding on the saving throw or after the 
possession ends.
Once you use this feature to possess a creature 
successfully, you may not do so again until you complete a 
long rest.</p>
<p>165 Arc anis 5e • Chap ter 2: Cl a sse s</p>
<p>Spirit-Speaker<br />
The Spirit-Speaker seeks to find greater understanding of 
the mortal realm by understanding the realm of the spirit. 
Spirits are drawn to shamans who follow this path due to 
their curiosity, and they willingly form bonds of service. 
Found almost anywhere, Spirit-Speakers are mostly self-
taught. They build upon their natural spiritual rapport 
and instinctual aptitude with magic to form bonds with 
powerful spirit guardians who take on the form of beasts.
Race Restrictions
Ss’ressen and undir may not choose this archetype. 
Geas and Taboos
You will go to extremes to not insult the spirits, calling 
to them by name and offering them additional offerings 
when able. If a spirit you are negotiating with demands a 
sacrifice, you will go above and beyond what was requested, 
commonly increasing the agreed-on price by 25%. 
Additionally, you must make a sacrifice to the spirits of 
5 gp worth of spices, wine, and herbs once a week. If you 
fail to meet this obligation, you cannot recover spell slots, 
and cast all cantrips as if you were five (5) levels lower 
(minimum of 1<sup>st</sup> level). This reduction lasts until you make 
the required sacrifice.
Expanded Spell List
As a Spirit-Speaker, you choose from an expanded list of 
spells when you learn a shaman spell. The following spells 
are added to the shaman spell list for you.

Instinctual Understanding
Starting at 3<sup>rd</sup> level, you gain a deeper understanding of the<br />
emotions and motivations of spirits. You have advantage on 
all Wisdom (Insight) checks when dealing with spirits. </p>
<p>Pejul (Companion Spirit)
At 3<sup>rd</sup> level, you also attract the attention of a pejul, 
a companion spirit, that agrees to act as your ally and 
guardian. 
Your pejul takes the form of a Medium-sized beast. It 
has the game statistics shown in the sidebar Companion 
Spirit, and gains the benefits of this feature. You can 
summon or dismiss your pejul as an action.
If your pejul is ever slain, you must complete a long 
rest before you can call upon your pejul again. Calling 
your pejul back after a long rest restores the spirit to full 
health.
Your pejul has a mind of its own, and only wants to 
defend and protect you. It rolls for initiative like any 
other creature, but your pejul will always attempt to 
remain adjacent to you, only moving to attack anyone 
who attacks you. Your spirit guardian will not move 
more than 60 feet away from you. 
As a bonus action, you can call on your pejul to 
return to your side, ceasing its attacks on a creature. 
If you are incapacitated or unconscious, your spirit 
guardian tries to take you out of harm’s way or defend 
you to the best of it’s ability, even to death.
Your pejul gains a variety of benefits while it is linked 
to you.
• Your pejul adds your proficiency bonus to its Armor 
Class as well as to all attack rolls, damage rolls, and 
saving throws. 
• When you reach 4<sup>th</sup> level in the shaman class and 
every level after that, your pejul gains an additional 
hit die, which increases it&rsquo;s hit point maximum by 5 
+ its Constitution modifier.
Whenever you gain the Ability Score Improvement class 
feature, your pejul further improves. You may choose 
to either increase one of your pejul’s ability scores of 
your choice by 2, or increase two of its ability scores 
by 1 (to a maximum ability score above 20). Instead of 
increasing your pejul’s ability scores, you can improve 
your companion spirit in one of the following ways: 
• Your pejul can take the form of flying beasts, 
changing its speed to 10 ft., 40 ft. fly
• Your pejul can take the form of Small and Large 
beasts as well as Medium ones. If your companion 
spirit takes a form of the appropriate size, you can 
ride it as a mount.
• Your pejul’s attacks are considered magical for the 
purposes of bypassing resistances and immunities.</p>
<p>Arc anis 5e • Chap ter 2: Cl a sse s 166</p>
<p>Pejul are unique among spirit kind. They bond to a 
particular shaman and possess the ability to take 
on the form of any non-flying medium sized beast 
the shaman desires. These spirits share the same 
statistics regardless of their chosen form. When 
called, your pejul appears in an unoccupied space 
within 15 feet of you. The spirit looks like a normal 
animal but detects as magical and is revealed as a 
spirit via the shaman’s Between Worlds feature.

Abolish Spirit 
Starting at 6<sup>th</sup> level, you gain the ability to channel divine

Divinity option:
Abolish Spirit: As an action, you present your primal 
focus and speak a prayer censuring spirits. One spirit of 
your choice that can see or hear you within 30 feet of you 
must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails 
its saving throw, it is banished to the Spirit Realm, as long 
as its challenge rating is at or below a certain threshold, as 
shown in the table below. A creature that is banished this 
way cannot return to this Mortal Realm until the next

<p>A spirit that you do not banish with this feature is turned 
for 1 minute or until it takes any damage. A turned creature 
must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you 
as it can, and can’t willingly move to a space within 30 feet 
of you. It also can’t take reactions. For its action, it can use 
only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that 
prevents it from moving. If there’s nowhere to move, the 
creature can use the Dodge action.

Once you use this feature, you cannot use it again until you 
complete a short rest. 
Voice of the Spirits
At 10<sup>th</sup> level, you learn how to cast spirit journey* once, 
without expending a spell slot, regaining the ability to do so 
after completing a long rest. 
   Whenever you cast spirit journey* you may offer a fate 
debt in place of the material component costs. This fate 
debt comes in the form of particularly bad luck. Anytime 
within the next 24 hours, your GM may have you reroll any 
successful saving throw or attack roll. You must abide by 
the new roll.
If you roll a natural 20 on the reroll from your fate debt, 
the spirits are not only appeased but impressed. The next 
time you cast spirit journey*, the spirits praise you and are 
much more willing to assist you. The exact effects of the 
spirits’ heightened estimation of you are left to the GM.
Perilous Journey 
At 16<sup>th</sup> level, you can force a creature into the Spirit Realm. 
As an action, you can touch a creature and force them to 
make a Charisma saving throw against your spell save DC. 
If they fail their save, the creature is physically expelled into 
the Spirit Realm.
A creature expelled into The Spirit Realm is ripped 
asunder, suffering 10d10 force damage, and they reappear 
where they were on Mortal Realm, prone, at the end of 
their next turn. 
Constructs and spirits suffer no damage from being 
expelled into the Spirit Realm but are still physically 
removed from the Mortal Realm. Once you use this feature, 
you cannot use it again until you complete a long rest. </p>
