<p>Favored Enemy Beginning at 1<sup>st</sup> level, you have significant experience studying, tracking, hunting, and even talking to a certain type of enemy commonly encountered in the wilds.</p>
<p>Choose a type of favored enemy: beasts, fey, humanoids, monstrosities, or undead. You gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with weapon attacks against creatures of the chosen type. Additionally, you have advantage on Wisdom <span><span class="MathJax_Preview">Survival</span><script type="math/tex">Survival</script></span> checks to track your favored enemies, as well as on Intelligence checks to recall information about them.</p>
<p>When you gain this feature, you also learn one language of your choice, typically one spoken by your favored enemy or creatures associated with it. However, you are free to pick any language you wish to learn.</p>
<p>Natural Explorer You are a master of navigating the natural world, and you react with swift and decisive action when attacked. This grants you the following benefits:</p>
<p>You ignore difficult terrain. You have advantage on initiative rolls. On your first turn during combat, you have advantage on attack rolls against creatures that have not yet acted. In addition, you are skilled at navigating the wilderness. You gain the following benefits when traveling for an hour or more:</p>
<p>Difficult terrain doesn&rsquo;t slow your group&rsquo;s travel. Your group can&rsquo;t become lost except by magical means. Even when you are engaged in another activity while traveling <span><span class="MathJax_Preview">such as foraging, navigating, or tracking</span><script type="math/tex">such as foraging, navigating, or tracking</script></span>, you remain alert to danger. If you are traveling alone, you can move stealthily at a normal pace. When you forage, you find twice as much food as you normally would. While tracking other creatures, you also learn their exact number, their sizes, and how long ago they passed through the area. Spellcasting By the time you reach 2<sup>nd</sup> level, you have learned to use the magical essence of nature to cast spells, much as a druid does. See chapter 10 for the general rules of spellcasting and chapter 11 for the ranger spell list.</p>
<p>Spell Slots The Ranger table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1<sup>st</sup> level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell&rsquo;s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>
<p>For example, if you know the 1<sup>st</sup>-level spell animal friendship and have a 1<sup>st</sup>-level and a 2<sup>nd</sup>-level spell slot available, you can cast animal friendship using either slot.</p>
<p>Spells Known of 1<sup>st</sup> Level and Higher You know two 1<sup>st</sup>-level spells of your choice from the ranger spell list.</p>
<p>The Spells Known column of the Ranger table shows when you learn more ranger spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 5<sup>th</sup> level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1<sup>st</sup> or 2<sup>nd</sup> level.</p>
<p>Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the ranger spells you know and replace it with another spell from the ranger spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>
<p>Spellcasting Ability Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your ranger spells, since your magic draws on your attunement to nature. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a ranger spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>
<p>Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>
<p>Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>
<p>Fighting Style At 2<sup>nd</sup> level, you adopt a particular style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the following options. You can&rsquo;t take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.</p>
<p>Archery You gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls you make with ranged weapons.</p>
<p>Defense While you are wearing armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC.</p>
<p>Dueling When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon.</p>
<p>Two-Weapon Fighting When you engage in two-weapon fighting, you can add your ability modifier to the damage of the second attack.</p>
<p>Primeval Awareness Beginning at 3<sup>rd</sup> level, your mastery of ranger lore allows you to establish a powerful link to beasts and to the land around you.</p>
<p>You have an innate ability to communicate with beasts, and they recognize you as a kindred spirit. Through sounds and gestures, you can communicate simple ideas to a beast as an action, and can read its basic mood and intent. You learn its emotional state, whether it is affected by magic of any sort, its short-term needs <span><span class="MathJax_Preview">such as food or safety</span><script type="math/tex">such as food or safety</script></span>, and actions you can take <span><span class="MathJax_Preview">if any</span><script type="math/tex">if any</script></span> to persuade it to not attack.</p>
<p>You cannot use this ability against a creature that you have attacked within the past 10 minutes.</p>
<p>Additionally, you can attune your senses to determine if any of your favored enemies lurk nearby. By spending 1 uninterrupted minute in concentration <span><span class="MathJax_Preview">as if you were concentrating on a spell</span><script type="math/tex">as if you were concentrating on a spell</script></span>, you can sense whether any of your favored enemies are present within 5 miles of you. This feature reveals which of your favored enemies are present, their numbers, and the creatures&rsquo; general direction and distance <span><span class="MathJax_Preview">in miles</span><script type="math/tex">in miles</script></span> from you.</p>
<p>If there are multiple groups of your favored enemies within range, you learn this information for each group.</p>
<p>Ranger Conclave At 3<sup>rd</sup> level, you choose to emulate the ideals and training of a ranger conclave from the list of available conclaves. Your choice grants you features at 3<sup>rd</sup> level and again at 5<sup>th</sup>, 7<sup>th</sup>, 11<sup>th</sup>, and 15<sup>th</sup> level.</p>
<p>Beast Conclave <span><span class="MathJax_Preview">UA</span><script type="math/tex">UA</script></span> Many rangers are more at home in the wilds than in civilization, to the point where animals consider them kin. Rangers of the Beast Conclave develop a close bond with a beast, then further strengthen that bond through the use of magic.</p>
<p>Animal Companion At 3<sup>rd</sup> level, you learn to use your magic to create a powerful bond with a creature of the natural world.</p>
<p>With 8 hours of work and the expenditure of 50 gp worth of rare herbs and fine food, you call forth an animal from the wilderness to serve as your faithful companion. You normally select you companion from among the following animals: an ape, a black bear, a boar, a giant badger, a giant weasel, a mule, a panther, or a wolf. However, your DM might pick one of these animals for you, based on the surrounding terrain and on what types of creatures would logically be present in the area.</p>
<p>At the end of the 8 hours, your animal companion appears and gains all the benefits of your Companion&rsquo;s Bond ability. You can have only one animal companion at a time.</p>
<p>If your animal companion is ever slain, the magical bond you share allows you to return it to life. With 8 hours of work and the expenditure of 25 gp worth of rare herbs and fine food, you call forth your companion&rsquo;s spirit and use your magic to create a new body for it. You can return an animal companion to life in this manner even if you do not possess any part of its body.</p>
<p>If you use this ability to return a former animal companion to life while you have a current animal companion, your current companion leaves you and is replaced by the restored companion.</p>
<p>Companion&rsquo;s Bond Your animal companion gains a variety of benefits while it is linked to you.</p>
<p>The animal companion loses its Multiattack action, if it has one.</p>
<p>The companion obeys your commands as best it can. It rolls for initiative like any other creature, but you determine its actions, decisions, attitudes, and so on. If you are incapacitated or absent, your companion acts on its own.</p>
<p>When using your Natural Explorer feature, you and your animal companion can both move stealthily at a normal pace.</p>
<p>Your animal companion has abilities and game statistics determined in part by your level. Your companion uses your proficiency bonus rather than its own. In addition to the areas where it normally uses its proficiency bonus, an animal companion also adds its proficiency bonus to its AC and to its damage rolls.</p>
<p>Your animal companion gains proficiency in two skills of your choice. It also becomes proficient with all saving throws.</p>
<p>For each level you gain after 3<sup>rd</sup>, your animal companion gains an additional hit die and increases its hit points accordingly</p>
<p>Whenever you gain the Ability Score Improvement class feature, your companion&rsquo;s abilities also improve. Your companion can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or it can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, your companion can&rsquo;t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature unless its description specifies otherwise.</p>
<p>Your companion shares your alignment, and has a personality trait and a flaw that you can roll for or select from the tables below. Your companion shares your ideal, and its bond is always, &ldquo;The ranger who travels with me is a beloved companion for whom I would gladly give my life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Your animal companion gains the benefits of your Favored Enemy feature, and of your Greater Favored Enemy feature when you gain that feature at 6<sup>th</sup> level. It uses the favored enemies you selected for those features.</p>
<p>Companion Trait d6 Trait 1 I&rsquo;m dauntless in the face of adversity. 2 Threaten my friends, threaten me. 3 I stay on alert so others can rest. 4 People see an animal and underestimate me. 5 I have a knack for showing up in the nick of time. 6 I put my friends&rsquo; needs before my own in all things. Companion Flaw d6 Flaw 1 If there&rsquo;s food left unattended, I&rsquo;ll eat it. 2 I growl at strangers, and all people except my ranger are strangers to me. 3 Any time is a good time for a belly rub. 4 I&rsquo;m deathly afraid of water. 5 My idea of hello is a flurry of licks to the face. 6 I jump on creatures to tell them how much I love them. Gloom Stalker Gloom Stalkers are at home in the darkest places: deep under the earth, in gloomy alleyways, in primeval forests, and wherever else the light dims. Most folk enter such places with trepidation, but a Gloom Stalker ventures boldly into the darkness, seeking to ambush threats before they can reach the broader world. Such rangers are often found in the Underdark, but they will go any place where evil lurks in the shadows.</p>
<p>Gloom Stalker Magic Starting at 3<sup>rd</sup> level, you learn an additional spell when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown in the Gloom Stalker Spells table. The spell counts as a ranger spell for you, but it doesn&rsquo;t count against the number of ranger spells you know.</p>
<p>Gloom Stalker Spells Ranger Level Spells 3<sup>rd</sup> disguise self 5<sup>th</sup> rope trick 9<sup>th</sup> fear 13<sup>th</sup> greater invisibility 17<sup>th</sup> seeming Dread Ambusher At 3<sup>rd</sup> level, you master the art of the ambush. You can give yourself a bonus to your initiative rolls equal to your Wisdom modifier.</p>
<p>At the start of your first turn of each combat, your walking speed increases by 10 feet, which lasts until the end of that turn. If you take the Attack action on that turn, you can make one additional weapon attack as part of that action. If that attack hits, the target takes an extra 1d8 damage of the weapon&rsquo;s damage type.</p>
<p>Umbral Sight At 3<sup>rd</sup> level, you gain darkvision out to a range of 60 feet. If you already have darkvision from your race, its range increases by 30 feet.</p>

<p>Sanctified Herbcraft
Beginning at 3<sup>rd</sup> level you learn how to infuse your herbalism with divine magic. When applying ointment of healing to a creature you may, as a bonus action, expend a spell level slot to have all die rolls with results equal to or less then the spell level slot used increased to the spell level slot used +1. (Example: When healing someone for 3d6 you expend a 2<sup>nd</sup> level spell slot and any die roll of 1, 2, or 3 is treated as if you rolled a 4.)
Divine Spellcaster
Beginning at 3<sup>rd</sup> level you start to learn how to cast a small number of specialized cants invoking Belisarda’s blessings.
Cantrips
You know two cantrips of your choice from the warder spell list. You learn an additional cantrip once you reach 11<sup>th</sup> level.
Preparing and Casting Spells
The Warder table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1<sup>st</sup> level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.
You prepare the list of warder spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the warder spell list. When you do so, choose a number of warder spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + half your ranger level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.
Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.
You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of cleric spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.
Spellcasting Ability
Wisdom is your spell casting ability score for warder spells. Your magic comes from your will and your convictions. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a warder spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.
Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier
Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier
Ritual Casting
You can cast a warder spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.
Spellcasting Focus
You can use a divine focus as a spellcasting focus for your warder spells.
The Hunter&rsquo;s Territory
At 7<sup>th</sup> level you develop the ability to create an uncanny connection with the land. Once you have stayed in a particular area (a 20 mile range of natural, mostly wild, terrain) for more than a week you may develop a powerful bond with the area, making it your hunter’s territory. Creating this bond requires a ritual lasting at least 8 hours, which can be done while preforming a long rest.
Once set you instantly know if you share your hunter’s territory with other elorii, and how many, but not their identity. While within your hunter’s territory you gain advantage on all Wisdom (Perception), Wisdom (Survival) and Dexterity (Stealth) checks.
Once you reach 11<sup>th</sup> level, and as long as you are on the same continent as your hunter’s territory, any time a sentient creature enters your hunter’s territory it must make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell casting DC. Upon a failed save you are alerted of its entry into your hunter’s territory and the general area in which it entered. If your hunter’s territory is above ground this ability detects intruders to a height of 60 feet, if below ground within the Endless Dark your hunter’s territory extends up 30 feet or to right below the surface and 30 feet below.
This bond remains as long as you spend at least one long rest a month within your territory, if you attempt to set another area as your territory, you must break the bond with your current territory.
Additionally, when not within your hunter’s territory but operating within one of your favored terrains you gain advantage on all Wisdom (Perception) and Intelligence (Investigation) checks.
Additional Fighting Style
At 11<sup>th</sup> level, you can choose a second option from the Fighting Style class feature.
Hunter&rsquo;s Instincts
Staring at 15 th level when you attack a creature by surprise who is set as your quarry you deal an additional 3d6 damage. Additionally, you may use a 4<sup>th</sup> level spell slot to cast tree stride while traveling within your territory and scrying to look in on any part of your territory.

<p>Talon of the Hawk
Within the secret society known only as the Sanctorum
of the Arcane, there exists a smaller, even more secret sect
called the Hawk. All know of its existence, yet its members
remain shrouded in mystery. If there is anything that will
make a Harvester reconsider their plans, it is the golden
hawk pin that these rangers use to signify their allegiance.
Talons of the Hawk train hard and study the
Harvesters’ own techniques to better combat them. They
have sworn that one day they will wipe the Sorcerer King
from the face of the land. One day, mages will be free to
reveal themselves. Until then, the Hawk shall not sheathe
its talons.
Additional Proficiencies: When you take this archetype
you gain proficiency in Arcana.
Race Restrictions
You must possess the ability to be an Eldritch or Elder
spell caster.
Hunted by Ymandragore
The Sorcerer King of Ymandragore hunts all arcane casters.
Displaying your sorcerous skills openly or in a public
setting is a sure way to end your career early.
Spellcasting
Beginning at 3<sup>rd</sup> level you start to learn how to cast a small
number of arcane spells. You also learn how to manipulate
the power of Creation and bend it to your will.
Arcane Flexibility
You gain 1 arcane point and gain more arcane points as
you reach higher levels in this class, as shown in the Arcane
Points column of the Talon of the Hawk table. You can
never have more arcane points than shown on the table
for your level. You regain all spent arcane points when you
finish a long rest.
See Chapter VI: Magic of Arcanis for more information
on arcane points and how to use them.
Cantrips
You know two cantrips of your choice from the eldritch
sorcerer spell list, or from the elder
sorcerer spell list if you are
capable of learning the Elder
Tradition. You learn an
additional cantrip once
you reach 11<sup>th</sup> level.
Metamagic
One of the first
lessons you were
taught was how
to properly
hide your spell
casting. You gain
the Subtle Spell
Metamagic
option.
You gain
an additional
Metamagic
option at 11<sup>th</sup>
level and again
at 15<sup>th</sup> level.
You can
only use one
Metamagic
option on a
spell when you
cast it, unless
otherwise
noted.
143 Arcanis 5e • Chapter 2: Classes
See Chapter VI: Magic of Arcanis for a complete list of
Metamagic options and how to use them.
Spells Known of 1<sup>st</sup> Level and Higher
You know two 1<sup>st</sup>-level spells of your choice from the
eldrich sorcerer spell list. You can only select spells from the
elder sorcerer spell list instead if you are capable of learning
the Elder Tradition.
The Spells Known column of Talon of the Hawk table
shows when you learn more Talon of the Hawk spells of
your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level for
which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach
7<sup>th</sup> level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1<sup>st</sup> or
2<sup>nd</sup> level.
Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can
choose one of the Talon of the Hawk spells you know and
replace it with another spell from the Talon of the Hawk
spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have
spell slots.
Spellcasting Ability
If you choose your Talon of the Hawk spells from the elder
sorcerer spell list, your spellcasting ability is Intelligence.
If you choose your Talon of the Hawk spells from eldritch
sorcerer spell list, your spellcasting ability is Charisma.
You use your Intelligence or Charisma whenever a spell
refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your
available, you can cast burning hands using either slot.
Instinctive Counterspell
At 3<sup>rd</sup> level, you can cast counterspell once without
expending a spell slot, and regain the ability to do so after
finishing a short or long rest.
Mage Slayer
At 7<sup>th</sup> level, while engaged in combat with spellcasters, you
know the best moment to strike. Any time a creature casts a
spell within your reach they provoke opportunity attack.
Combat Caster
At 11<sup>th</sup> level you have learned how to combine weapons
and spells to devastating effect. When you take the Attack
action you may cast a cantrip as a bonus action.
Enhanced Counterspell
At 15<sup>th</sup> level, you have become adept at rapidly gathering
power to quickly interrupt spells. Any time you are
required to make an ability check to successfully dispel or
counter a spell, you may add half your proficiency bonus
to the ability check. </p>
