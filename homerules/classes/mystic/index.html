For their enemies, they bring fear, disgust, and trepidation that can make even the most hardened veteran act like a shaky rookie.</p>

Choose a spot you can see within 60 feet of you. Magical darkness radiates from that point in a sphere with a 10-foot radius per psi point spent on this ability. The light produced by spells of 2<sup>nd</sup> level or less is suppressed in this area. Light <span><span class="MathJax_Preview">2 psi; conc., 1 min.</span><script type="math/tex">2 psi; conc., 1 min.</script></span>.
