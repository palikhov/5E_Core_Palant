## Design Goals

1) Provide structure to the gameplay elements assosiated with clothes.
2) Retain the design phylosophy of 5e by making the rules simple and easy to use.
3) Make the rules streamlined in order to easily implement them in any campaign and reduce the bookkeeping to a minimum.
4) Make the rules modular and adjustable so that DMs and Players can easily come up with new outfits on the fly.

## What is an outfit?

An outfit is a set of clothes that a creature wears at any given time. You don't track each individual article of clothing on your person just like you don't track elements of your armor. You can wear only one outfit at a time.

Each outfit has a number of properties that distinguish it from other outfits. There are three mandatory properties: Size, Lifestyle and Culture. Also, an outfit may have unlimited number of optional properties, which may have gameplay effects. 

## Mandatory Properties

### Size

The size of an outfit can be tiny, small, medium, huge or gargantuan. A creature of one size can not wear the outfit designed for a creature of another size. For example, a warrior's outfit made for a medium sized human will not fit a small halfling. This property affect the base price of the outfit as shown in the table 

*Outfit prices per size*

tiny - 1/2 of the base price
small - 1x of the base price
medium - 1x of the base price
large - 2x of the base price
huge - 4x of the base price
gargantuan - 8x of the base price

***Optional Rule. Outfit sizes within the same category.*** Outfit sizes within the same category.  When adventurers find clothing, they might need to visit a tailor, leatherworker, or similar expert to make the outfit wearable. The cost for such work varies from 10 to 40 percent of the market price of the item. The DM can either roll 1d4 × 10 or determine the increase in cost based on the extent of the alterations required. Otherwise, a creature can wear the outfit but it will have disadvantage on Dexterity checks and Saving Throws.

### Lifestyle

People will be judged and appreciated by what they wear so dressing according to one's lifestyle can facilitate communication depending on what your goals are.

An outfit can be wretched, squalid, poor, modest, comfortable, wealthy or aristocratic. This property determines the base cost of an outfit as shown in the table *Base Costs of Outfits*.

***Wretched***. This outfit is ruined and serves only to cover nakedness. Slaves, poorest beggars and creatures who disregard their clothes wear wretched outfits.

***Squalid.*** This outfit could feature cheap second-hand garments and well-worn footwear. People on the brink of poverty, prisoners, beggars wear squalid outfits.

***Poor.*** This outfit could feature simple and homemade items such as roughspun shirts, trousers and skirts. Pilgrims, landless peasants, unskilled workers wear poor outfits.

***Modest***. This outfit could include adequately designed garments made of materials easily available in the area. Peasants, servants, militia soldiers, lower clergymen, ordinary workers, craftsmen wear modest outfits.

***Comfortable***. This outfit could feature well-designed pieces of clothing made of good quality local materials with decorative parts made of expensive materials such as silk or animal fur. Generally speaking, this outfit gives its wearer the impression of a well-off person. Professionals, artisans, scholars, owners of small businesses, clergymen and many adventurers wear comfortable outfits.

***Wealthy***. This outfit could feature richly decorated items of clothing made from good quality material designed for higher social stratas. Successful merchants, high clergymen, guild masters, prosperous artisans, knights in service of a wealthy master and lesser nobles wear wealthy outfits. 

***Aristocratic***. This outfit usually includes several items made from rare and exotic materials and accompanied by a good amount of high quality jewelry. Nobles, royal families, heads of states and the wealthiest members of a society wear aristocratic outfits. 

*Base cost of an outfit associated with a specific lifestyle*

Lifestyle | Outfit cost, gp
---------|----------
 Wretched | 0
 Squalid | 1
 Poor | 2
 Modest | 9
 Comfortable | 18
 Wealthy | 36
 Aristocratic | 90
 
### Culture

An outfit almost always represents a culture in which it was designed. A waterdhavian noble finery is very different from an elven noble outfit of Evereska. A character may choose to dress appropriately depending on where the character is. This property may increase the base cost of an outfit by 2-4 times if its culture property is different from the culture of the place where this outfit was aquired. This represents the cost of import/export and rarity of such outifts in the market.

***Sample Cultures***: Sword Coast, Waterdeep, Evereska, Uthgardt, Northern Dwarven, Calishite, Moonshae, Halruua, Wood Elves of the High Forest, Orcs of Many-Arrows.

## Optional properties

**Faction**

An outfit can represent its wearer as part of a faction. It can be a uniform or an outfit with distinguishing features that members of that faction recognize. A person wearing a faction outfit may pass as a member of that faction. This property doesn't affect the base cost of an outfit.

**Weather**

An outfit can be made specifically for wearing it during certain weather conditions. It is usually cold weather resistant or hot weather resistant but a DM can create or improvise outfits designed against other weather conditions, be they natural or not. This property increases the base outfit cost by 3 times representing rare designs or amount of materials needed to make it.

**Armor padding**

This outfit is suited for wearing it with metallic medium and heavy armor. The outfit must be assosiated with poor lifestyle or higher to benefit from the armor padding property. This property increases the base cost of an outfit by 2 times and represents the amount of materials used to make it.

**Sex**

An outfit can be designed for a male, female or both. A person wearing an outfit that is clearly designed for a different sex may be uncomfortable to wear or attract unwanted attention depending on the social norms in the area. If no property is mentioned, the outfit is assumed to be suited for all sexes. This property doesn't affect the base cost of an outift.

**Unconventional** 

This outfit consists of pieces of clothing that challenge the social norms of a society, or is designed to attract attention for one purpose or another. Performers, street magicians, people with rebellious tendencies usually wear unconventional outfits.

**Mixed and Matched** 

This outfit consits of pieces of clothing assosiated with different social classes and styles which makes it difficult to predict what class the wearer belongs to.

## Creating optional properties

It is easy to create new optional properties for an outfit. Think about what make a certain outfit special, assign a name for this property and give a quick description.

## Gameplay effects of properties

Benefits or penalties of properties can be assigned by a DM on individual basis. Think about what seems appropriate to the situation and assign benefits or penalties accordingly. For example, wearing an Aristocratic Calishite Unconventional outfit in the slums of Waterdeep may attract attention of local thiefs and thugs who might try to rob the character. Wearing beggar's rugs will insure that you won't get access to an aristocratic tavern. Wearing an outfit adorned with goblin heads and skulls may grant advantage to intimidation checks against them.
Determine the mechanical benefits or penalties by talking to your players or making a desicion on your own.

## Wearing armor and outfits.

You can wear wear one outfit and one set of armor at a time. If you wear a set of armor without an outfit you suffer the penalties as if you were not proficient with the armor due to lack of comfort.

*If you wear armor that you lack proficiency with, you have disadvantage on any ability check, saving throw, or attack roll that involves Strength or Dexterity, and you can't cast spells.*

## Selling outfits

Selling clothing follows the same rules as other mundane equipment. If it was not worn or used, it can be sold for 50% of its cost.  In other cases it may be too damaged or worn to sell unless the DM rules otherwise.

## Outfit formatting

**Name**
*[Size] [Lifestyle] Outfit: [culture property]; [optional properties]. [price]*

# Litercay and languages

**Literacy:** Among the human populace literacy is not a given. In fact, for the majority of the populace “knowing your letters” is a rarity. It is not uncommon for someone to be able to speak many languages and simply be unable to read or write in any of them. As such literacy has become a soft social meter which displays either tutoring or noble blood.

There are four ways to gain literacy; race, background ,giving up a known language, or aquiring the linguist feat.

Both dwarves and elorii have strong traditions of education and gain literacy through their racial heritage. Some backgrounds grant literacy and if you choose a background which oes not grant literacy you may become literate by giving up one of your known languages.

# Social interactions

# Exploring & Survival interactions

# Modified Three Pillars System

# Modified Three Pillar

This version of three pillar experience rewards players for exploration and social interaction, while maintaining the traditional character advancement scale and allowing the GM to reward XP for encounters.

Instead of rewarding a fixed amount, for Exploration and Social Interaction players receive a percentage of the XP required for them to get from their current level to the next \(calculated from the base XP of their level to the next, not including XP they've earned in between.\)

They may receive a higher or lower percentage depending on the their tier of play compared to the magnitude of their accomplishment.   

## Gaining Levels

Players gain levels according to the normal PHB Character Advancement table.

| XP | Level | XP to Next Level |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 0 | 1 | 300 |
| 300 | 2 | 600 |
| 900 | 3 | 1,800 |
| 2,700 | 4 | 3,800 |
| 6,500 | 5 | 7,500 |
| 14,000 | 6 | 9,000 |
| 23,000 | 7 | 11,000 |
| 34,000 | 8 | 14,000 |
| 48,000 | 9 | 16,000 |
| 64,000 | 10 | 21,000 |
| 85,000 | 11 | 15,000 |
| 100,000 | 12 | 20,000 |
| 120,000 | 13 | 20,000 |
| 140,000 | 14 | 25,000 |
| 165,000 | 15 | 30,000 |
| 195,000 | 16 | 30,000 |
| 225,000 | 17 | 40,000 |
| 265,000 | 18 | 40,000 |
| 302,000 | 19 | 50,000 |
| 355,000 | 20 | See Epic Boons |

## Dividing XP

For Exploration and Social Interaction, the XP award for an adventure is the same for each member of the party, instead of being divided among them.

     However, this does not mean the XP is awarded for individual merit. XP is awarded when the party as a whole accomplishes something, without splitting hairs about who contributed to what the most.   

### Pillar 1: Exploration

For discovering both Items and Locations, each player gains 5% at their tier, 5% additional for every tier above, none for below their tier.   

#### Items

In this version, players are rewarded for discovering magic items that are of the highest nonconsumable rarity suggested for their tier as per Xanathar's Guide.

| Tier 1 | A single art object or gem worth 100 gp or more, or a major uncommon item |
| :--- | :--- |
| Tier 2 | A single art object or gem worth 1,000 gp or more, or a major rare item |
| Tier 3 | A single art object or gem worth 5,000 gp or more, or a major very rare item |
| Tier 4 | A single art object or gem worth 50,000 gp or more, or a major legendary item |

#### Locations

A location's tier depends on the importance to your campaign, measured by the scope of its discovery or liberation's impact:

| Tier 1 | A location important to a small town or village |
| :--- | :--- |
| Tier 2 | A location vital to a kingdom |
| Tier 3 | A location important across the world |
| Tier 4 | A location of cosmic importance |

### Pillar 2: Social Interaction

#### NPCs

Players gain XP for turning important NPCs into allies, aligning them with their cause or denying them as assets to their enemies. The XP they gain is based on the NPC's power and influence.

      Each player gains 5% at their tier, 5% additional for every tier above, 2% for below their tier.

| Tier 1 | An NPC with influence over a small town or village, or the equivalent |
| :--- | :--- |
| Tier 2 | An NPC with influence over a city or the equivalent |
| Tier 3 | An NPC with influence over a kingdom, continent, or the equivalent |
| Tier 4 | An NPC \(including a deity\) with cosmic significance or influence across multiple worlds. |

#### Role Play

This modified Three Pillar method also rewards players for inter-party role play. The difficulty of inter-party role play should remain fairly constant throughout all tiers of play, so unlike the other categories in this method it is not awarded based on tier. Instead, it is awarded for specific group activities.

When the party interacts in character during a session, each member gains 5%. If the interaction is only partially in character, they gain 2%. If they create a story-changing or divergent moment, they gain an extra 5%.

Here are some examples of these interactions \(obviously party interaction situations are not limited to these\):

The party argues in character.

The party comes to a decision in character.

The party solves a mystery or puzzle in character.

Some party members conspire to play a trick on another party member

Some party members confront other party members about a problem or secret.

The party convinces an NPC to give them information that the NPC previously did not want to give, a significantly lower price on an item, or another form of important help.

More than half the party gains inspiration or role plays their TBIFs.

The party agrees to take a quest from an NPC in need.   

### Pillar 3: Combat

Players gain 85% of the encounter XP, rounding decimals down, divided between them and any NPCs that contributed. This is used for combats, traps, and puzzles which award XP.

#### **Reddit Formatting**

I liked the idea of three pillar experience, but it had many flaws, so I made some heavy modifications. Here's why it's better:

* It uses the regular Character Advancement table from the Player's Handbook
* It allows to DM to award encounter XP
* It rewards players for inter-party role play as well as role play with NPC's
* It rewards players for discovering the rarest items appropriate to their tier according to Xanathar's Guide \(the original required players to discover items above their tier.\)

## The Three Pillars of Play

For an explaination of the three pillars of play, see the original UA. In short, players get XP for each of the three pillars: exploration, social interaction, and combat.

## Gaining Levels

Players gain levels according to the normal PHB Character Advancement table.

### Role Play

The difficulty of inter-party role play should remain fairly constant throughout all tiers of play, so unlike the other categories in this method it is not awarded based on tier. Instead, it is awarded for specific group activities.

When the party interacts in character during a session, each member gains 5%. If the interaction is only partially in character, they gain 2%. If they create a story-changing or divergent moment, they gain an extra 5%.

Here are some examples of these interactions \(obviously party interaction situations are not limited to these\):

* The party argues in character.
* The party comes to a decision in character.
* The party solves a mystery or puzzle in character.

* More than half the party gains inspiration or role plays their traits, ideals, bonds, or flaws.
* The party agrees to take a quest from an NPC in need.  

## Combat

Players gain 85% of the encounter XP, rounding decimals down, divided between them and any NPCs that contributed. This is used for combats, traps, and puzzles which award XP.

Full encounter XP is not given to balance for the fact that the recommended XP awards for monsters do not take into account that players will be awarded XP for anything else.  Additionally, this means that players must engage with the other tiers to advance at a normal rate.

# Factions

Disfavor with a faction imposes disadvantage on all Charisma (Persuasion) and Charisma (Intimidate) skill checks made with that faction. In the case of Favors with large groups, you only gain this penalty when interacting with those of high station such as a general, a king, or the patriarch of a patrician family associated with that power.

* You may use a Favor to cancel a Disfavor from the same faction. This voids both the Favor and Disfavor immediately.

* You may spend a Favor with a given faction/group/individual (at GM’s discussion) to gain the benefits of a one-time expenditure of 3 fame with that faction/group/individual. You may spend two favors with the same factionBto gain the benefits of a 5-point fame expenditure.

Make a Dexterity (Acrobatics] check to balance when you try to keep your feet in a tricky situation, such as when you’re trying to run across a sheet of ice, balance on a tightrope, or stay upright on a rocking ship’s deck. The DM might also call for a Dexterity (Acrobatics] check to see if you can perform acrobatic stunts, including dives, rolls, somersaults, and flips.

### Sleight of Hand

Whenever you attempt an act of legerdemain or manual trickery, such as planting something on someone else or concealing an object on your person, make a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand] check. You can also draw small weapons without alerting anyone that you have done so, such as when palming a knife or sliding darts out of your sleeve. And the DM might call for a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand] check to determine whether you can lift a coin purse off another person or slip something out of another person’s pocket.

### Stealth

Make a Dexterity (Stealth] check when you attempt to conceal yourself from enemies, slink past guards, slip away without being noticed, or sneak up on someone without being seen or heard.

### Other

The DM might call for a Dexterity check when you try to accomplish one of these tasks:
•	Keep a trap from functioning
•	Control a heavily laden cart on a steep descent
•	Steer a chariot around a tight turn or obstacle
•	Pick a lock
•	Stay in the saddle of a rearing horse
•	Securely tie up a prisoner
•	Wriggle free of bonds

## Constitution

Constitution checks are uncommon, because the endurance this ability represents is largely passive rather than involving a specific effort on the part of a creature. A Constitution check can model a creature’s attempt to push beyond normal limits, however. No skills apply to Constitution checks.
The DM might call for a Constitution check when a character tries to accomplish one of these tasks:
•	Hold his or her breath
•	March for hours without rest
•	Go without sleep
•	Survive without food or water
•	Quaff an entire stein of ale in one go
•	Roll down a steep slope without taking damage

## Intelligence

An Intelligence check comes into play when a creature needs to draw on logic, education, memory, or deductive reasoning. The Arcana, History, Nature, Religion, and Search skills apply to some Intelligence checks.

### Arcana

A character might make an Intelligence (Arcana] check to recall lore about spells, magic items, eldritch symbols, magical traditions, the planes of existence, or the inhabitants of those planes.

### History

A character might make an Intelligence (History] check to recall lore about historical events, legendary people, ancient kingdoms, past disputes, recent wars, or lost civilizations.

### Nature

A character might make an Intelligence (Nature] check to recall lore about terrain, plants and animals, the weather, or natural cycles.

### Religion

A character might make an Intelligence (Religion] #check to recall lore about deities, rites and prayers, ecclesiastical hierarchies, holy symbols, or the practices of secret cults.

### Invvestigation

When you look around for clues that point to a hidden object, such as a trap or secret door, or hints of a creature’s passage through an area, you make an Intelligence (Search] check.

### Other

The DM might call for an Intelligence check when a character tries to accomplish one of these tasks:
•	Communicate with a creature without words
•	Deduce what kind of weapon caused an injury
•	Estimate the value of a precious item
•	Pull together a disguise to help an ally pass as a city guard
•	Determine how to cause part of a tunnel to collapse
•	Pass off a forged document as real

## Wisdom

### Animal Handling

When there is any question whether you can calm down a domesticated animal, keep your mount from getting spooked, or intuit an animal’s intentions, make a Wisdom (Animal Handling] check.

### Perception

You might make a Wisdom (Perception] check to spot, hear, or otherwise detect the presence of something. For example, you might try to hear a conversation through a closed door, eavesdrop under an open window, or hear creatures moving stealthily toward you in the forest. Or you might try to spot things that are obscured or easy to miss, whether they are orcs lying in ambush ahead of you on a road, thugs hiding in the shadows of an alley, or candlelight under a closed secret door.

### Insight

When you attempt to determine the true intentions of another person, such as when searching out a lie or predicting someone’s next move, you can make a Wisdom (Insight] check. Doing so involves gleaning clues from body language, speech habits, and changes in mannerisms.

### Survival

A character might make a Wisdom (Survival] check to hunt wild game, guide a party safely through frozen wastelands, identify signs that owlbears live nearby, predict the weather, or avoid quicksand and other natural hazards.

### Medicine

When you try to stabilize a dying companion or quickly diagnose what common illness is afflicting him or her, you make a Wisdom (Medicine] check.

### Other Wisdom Checks

The DM might call for a Wisdom check when a character tries to accomplish one of these tasks:
•	Figure out the direction to a source of moving air while underground
•	Discern whether a seemingly dead or living creature is undead
•	Sense the true direction of an echoing sound

## Charisma

### Persuassion

When you attempt to influence someone or a group of people with your tact, social graces, or good nature, make a Charisma (Persuasion] check. Typically, you attempt to persuade someone when you are acting in good faith, to foster friendships, make cordial requests, or exhibit proper etiquette. Examples of persuading others include convincing a chamberlain to let you see the king, negotiating peace between warring tribes, or inspiring a crowd of townsfolk.

### Deception

When you make a Charisma (Deception] check, you are attempting to deceive someone, either verbally or through your actions, which can encompass everything from misleading others through ambiguity to telling outright lies. Typical situations include trying to fast-talk a guard, con a merchant, earn money through gambling, pass off a disguise, dull someone’s suspicions with false assurances, or maintain a straight face while telling a blatant lie.

### Intimidation

When you attempt to influence someone through overt threats, hostile actions, and physical violence, make a Charisma (Intimidation] check. Examples of when you would intimidate another include trying to pry information out of a prisoner, convincing street thugs to back down from a confrontation, or using the edge of a broken bottle to convince a sneering vizier to reconsider a decision.

### Performance

You make a Charisma (Performance] check to perform before an audience with music, dance, acting, legerdemain, storytelling, or some other form of entertainment.

### Other Charisma Checks

The DM might call for a Charisma check when a character tries to accomplish one of these tasks:
•	Find the best person to talk to for news, rumors, and gossip
•	Blend into a crowd to get the sense of key topics of conversation

## Disguise Kit

## Stealth
When a creature tries to hide, it relies on its Dexterity to remain unnoticed. A creature can attempt a Dexterity (Stealth] check to sneak around, moving quietly and using cover and heavily obscured areas to avoid detection.

There are two ways you can hide. If a creature can’t possibly see you, you need only to avoid making noise to avoid detection. If a creature might see you, you need to keep behind cover or stay in heavily obscured areas to remain hidden.

When you try to hide from one or more creatures, your Dexterity (Stealth] check is contested by the Wisdom (Perception] check of any creature who might notice you or the Intelligence (Search] check of a creature that is actively searching for signs of your presence.
You make one Dexterity (Stealth] check for this contest. Use that check result for all such contests you engage in until you are discovered or you stop hiding.

### Conditions for Stealth

In order to avoid detection, you need some way to remain out of sight, either something to hide behind or an area of poor visibility to locate yourself in.

Stay out of sight. You can’t just stand in the middle of an empty, lit room and hope to avoid notice. Something must conceal you, perhaps a large object, a piece of terrain, or an immobile creature of a sufficient size, such as a slumbering dragon. Regardless of what stands between you and a viewer, it must cover at least half your body for you to hide behind it.

An environmental phenomenon that obscures you from view can also provide a means to hide.

A heavily obscured area typically contains darkness, opaque fog, or dense foliage. A creature in a heavily obscured area is out of sight, just as it if were hiding behind an obstruction, and thus can try to hide. A lightly obscured area typically contains dim light, patchy fog, or moderate foliage. Some monsters and characters have special abilities that enable them to try to hide even in areas that are only lightly obscured.

Stay quiet. It's assumed that you try to avoid making noise while hiding, and your Dexterity (Stealth] check also represents your ability to keep quiet. If you make a noise, such as yelling a warning to an ally or knocking over a vase, you give away your position and are thus no longer hidden.

### Benefit of Being Hidden

You have advantage on the attack roll when you attack a creature from which you are hidden. Making an attack reveals your position, however.

## Perception 

As you move through a dungeon, walk along a forest trail, or search a sage's sanctum, you rely on your abilities to spot hidden clues, notice lurking monsters, find traps or secret doors, and avoid unpleasant surprises. The DM describes the scene to you, but sometimes you want your character to search for something that the DM might be omitting from the description. The perception rules help determine whether your character notices or can find a hidden object or creature.

Noticing and Finding

Your Wisdom (Perception] check serves as a measure of your general awareness of your surroundings, whether you notice creatures lurking in ambush, hear the stealthy tread of an approaching assassin, or catch the telltale whiff of troglodyte in the air.

Your Intelligence (Investigation] check measures your ability to find something you're looking for, whether it’s the faint outline of a secret door in a wall, the hollow sound that reveals a hidden compartment in the bottom of a chest, clues to a murder, or the footsteps of an invisible creature in the dust.

Sherlock Holmes, renowned for his Intelligence, is the undisputed master of finding clues and determining their significance (using the Investigation skill]. Tarzan, on the other hand, who unfailingly hears the rustle of leaves or the snap of a twig, or sees a stalking tiger or lurking snake, relies on his Wisdom (Perception).

The line between using Wisdom or Intelligence can seem indistinct at times. Making an effort to notice something might seem similar to finding something you’re looking for, but it still relies on Wisdom (Perception], because it’s more about general awareness than it is about attention to detail. Likewise, if you spend a moment to scan the surrounding trees, or press your ear to a door to hear what might lurk beyond, you’re relying on Wisdom (Perception] rather than Intelligence (Investigation]. 

**As a rule, if you’re not positive that Intelligence is the right choice, then Wisdom is the ability to use.**

### Finding a Hidden Object

When your character searches for a hidden object, such as a secret door or a trap, the DM typically asks you to make an Intelligence (Search] check. Such a check can be used to find hidden details or other information and clues that you might otherwise overlook. The DM sets the DC, as usual.

In most cases, you need to tell the DM where you are looking in order for him or her to determine your chance of success. For example, a key is hidden beneath a set of folded clothes in the top drawer of a bureau. If you tell the DM that you pace around the room, looking at the walls and furniture for clues, you have no chance of finding the key, regardless of your Intelligence (Search] check result. You would have to specify that you were opening the drawers or searching the bureau in order to have any chance of success.
Since traps and other dangers might protect hidden objects, this attention to detail is important for the game to remain fair. Just as the DM should never dictate your character’s actions, so too should you make your intentions clear to the DM when you search for concealed clues and hidden treasures.

### Noticing or Finding a Hidden Creature

When a creature is hiding from your character, you contest that creature’s Dexterity (Stealth] check with either a Wisdom (Perception] check

or an Intelligence (Investigation] check. The DM usually asks you for a Wisdom (Perception] check if you have no idea that a creature is present and thus no reason to be actively searching, or if you're taking a moment to scan your surroundings or listen for movement. In this case, your search is a mix of looking and listening, so you don't normally need to be too specific in your description of where you're searching. A lurking foe might give itself away with a muffled cough, a trail of disturbed dust, or some other sign.

The DM generally asks for an Intelligence (Investigation] check if you’re specifically searching for clues to a hidden creature’s location. Here the guidelines for finding a hidden object apply; you need to tell the DM if you’re looking at the curtains for a telltale bulge, checking the floor for footprints, or taking some other action to find the creature.

### Listening at a Door

As your character explores a dungeon or a similar environment, one way to be prepared for dangers ahead is to press your ear to a door in an effort to hear signs of activity beyond. If humanoid creatures are occupying the area, you might hear the casual conversation of bored sentries or a fierce argument between two rival chieftains. If a dragon is sleeping on its treasure pile, you might hear the rhythmic whisper of its breathing, perhaps punctuated by fiery snorts or the crackle of electricity around its nostrils.

When you listen at a door or otherwise try to hear noise in an area, the DM asks you to make a Wisdom (Perception] check, setting the DC based on the volume of whatever you might hear.

# Social Interactions

Exploring dungeons, overcoming obstacles, and slaying monsters are key parts of most D&D adventures, but no less important are the interactions that adventurers have with other people, monsters, and even things in the world. Nonplayer characters might serve as patrons who send the adventurers on quests and reward them for their efforts, as allies who offer them material aid to help them accomplish their goals, as companions who accompany them on their adventures, as obstacles to achieving what they desire, and as adversaries in a social or political arena. Some monsters are open to negotiation when adventurers stumble into their lairs, perhaps granting the heroes their lives in exchange for great piles of treasure or the promise of better food elsewhere. Even dungeon features such as talking statues or magic mirrors can play an important role.

There are several schools of thought when it comes to handling interactions in a roleplaying game. Some players and DMs prefer to speak in character and adopt the mannerisms of their characters in the same way that an actor plays a role on stage. Others prefer to describe a character’s dialogue, giving a basic outline of what the character has to say. Neither approach is necessarily “correct,” and the approach you take has no impact on the rules for resolving interaction situations.

An interaction should always be driven by the back-and-forth between an NPC and the adventurers. No rules are necessary when the adventurers ask an innkeeper for directions or purchase a new coil of rope, and the DM might not even require the characters to play out these routine interactions. Roleplaying is important in important situations, and dice should come into play only when there is uncertainty about a conversation’s outcome. When the adventurers interrogate a captive orc, it might reveal the location of its lair or it might stay silent, even in the face of death. The characters’ words and actions, and their die rolls, help determine the orc’s response.

## Attitudes and Reactions

The starting point for an interaction encounter is the attitude of the NPCs or monsters involved. A creature’s attitude toward the adventurers determines how it acts and how it reacts when they make some request or demand of it.

During the course of an interaction, the adventurers may make requests or demands, and the Dungeon Master may ask for a Charisma check to influence that character. The results of the check are limited by the character’s attitude.

Note that simply rolling badly on a Charisma check does not change the character’s attitude; a low roll (below 10] simply means the adventurer does not convince the character to do something other than its default reaction.

### Friendly

Friendly characters want to help and wish for the adventurers to succeed. These characters are allies, and they trust the characters. A friendly character owes them loyalty, gratitude, or service as a result of their history together. Few characters begin an encounter friendly.

The only reason to make a check when dealing with a friendly character is to see if the character will take personal risks or make sacrifices on behalf of the adventurers. Otherwise, for tasks or actions that require no particular risk, effort, or cost, friendly characters usually help without question.

FRIENDLY NPC REACTIONS DC Result

Default The NPC will do as you wish for requests that don't involve risks or sacrifice 

10 The NPC accepts a minor risk or sacrifice to do as you wish

20 The NPC accepts a significant risk or sacrifice to do as you wish

### Indifferent

Indifferent characters have no special ties to the adventurers. They might help or hinder the adventurers, depending on what benefits them the most. The vast majority of NPCs in normal situations begin an encounter indifferent.

Note that a character’s indifference does not mean the person is standoffish or uninterested. Indifferent characters might be polite, genial, surly, irritable, or anywhere in between. Being indifferent simply means the NPC does not actively work against the adventurers, nor have they yet earned the NPC’s support as an ally.

A check is usually necessary when the adventurers try to persuade an indifferent character to do something.

INDIFFERENT NPC REACTIONS DC Result

Default The NPC offers no help or harm 

10 The NPC will do as you wish without taking risks or making sacrifices

20 The NPC accepts a minor risk or sacrifice to do as you wish

### Hostile

Hostile characters oppose the adventurers and their goals. They are enemies, and they actively work to see the adventurers fail. They often take actions to harm or stymie the adventurers.

However, a character’s hostility doesn’t mean that the character will attack on sight. For example, a condescending noble might wish to see a group of upstart adventurers fail in order to keep them from rivaling him for the king’s attention; in this case, the noble might be hostile toward the adventurers, but would choose slander and scheming over direct, physical violence as a means of thwarting their efforts.

Adventurers almost always need to make a fairly challenging Charisma check to convince a hostile creature to do anything on their behalf.

HOSTILE NPC REACTIONS DC	Result

Default The NPC opposes your actions and may take risks to do so

10	The NPC offers no help or harm

20 The NPC will help you as long as there are no risks or sacrifices involved

## Changing Attitudes	

Character attitudes are not set in stone, and the attitude of a character interacting with the party might change over the course of a conversation. Attitudes are fluid, and sometimes shift (either temporarily, or permanently] based on ongoing interactions.

Permanently changing a character’s attitude requires a significant effort. It’s impossible to completely change an attitude over the course of a brief conversation, but it can change over time. A character’s attitude changes in response to actions, not words. If a character offers help to the adventurers, who then abuse that offer, the character might become hostile. Likewise, a hostile character who profits from the party’s actions can become indifferent or even friendly. After any interaction, the Dungeon Master can change the character’s attitude for the purposes of his or her next interaction with the party if the long-term results of the interaction harmed or benefited the character.

Temporarily changing a character’s attitude, however, is somewhat easier and can have a significant effect on the outcome of an interaction. If the adventurers say or do the right things during an interaction, they can make a hostile character temporarily indifferent, or an indifferent character temporarily friendly. Likewise, a gaffe, insult or harmful deed might make a friendly character temporarily indifferent, or an indifferent character hostile.

Typically, you cannot shift a character’s attitude (either temporarily, or permanently] more than one step during a single interaction.

## Ideals, Flaws, and Bonds

All characters have character traits known as ideals, flaws, and bonds, which can be used during an interaction to temporarily change a character’s attitude. Touching positively on a character’s ideals, flaws, or bonds during an interaction can shift the character’s attitude in a positive direction, and vice versa.

Ideals motivate the character to act in a certain way. This encompasses everything from the character’s life goal to a core belief system.

Ideals might answer any of these questions: What are the principles that this character will never betray? What would prompt this character to make sacrifices? What drives this character to act and guides its goals and ambitions? What is the single most important thing this character strives for?

Flaws represent the vices, compulsions, fears, and weaknesses of a character.

Flaws might answer any of these questions: What enrages the character? What is the one thing that he or she cannot bear to witness without becoming angry? What is the character afraid of? What’s the one person, concept, or event that he or she is terrified of? What are the character’s vices?

Bonds represent the character’s connection to people, places, and events in the world.

Bonds might answer any of these questions: Whom does the character care most about? To where does the character feel a special connection? What is the character’s most treasured possession?

Whenever a request or statement in an interaction touches on a character’s ideals, flaws, or bonds, it might have a positive or negative impact on the character’s reaction, making it easier or harder to persuade the character to act. Here are some examples:

*	A druid’s ideals include protecting the forest. Asking the druid to help burn down the forest betrays this ideal and would shift the druid’s reaction toward hostility.
*	The head of the Thieves’ Guild holds ideals involving profit and larceny. Asking the guildmaster for help in pulling off a heist plays into this ideal and might get a more positive response.
*	A barbarian chieftain’s flaw might be a fear of being perceived as weak. Trying to persuade him to back down from a fight would play right into that fear, shifting his attitude toward hostility.
*	A farmer’s flaw might be an overwhelming fear of orcs raiding his farm. Persuading him to flee his home is much easier if the characters can play off that fear.
*	A noble’s bonds might include his love for his dearest daughter. Asking him to put her at risk for any reason threatens that bond and shifts his attitude toward hostility.
*	A paladin’s bonds might include his fondness for his home village. Asking him to help defend the village from attack is a relatively easy task.

## Learning a Character's Traits

If the adventurers can learn another character’s ideals, flaws, or bonds before or during an interaction, they can gain a significant advantage compared to stumbling blindly through the interaction. Knowing a character’s traits allows them to avoid the pitfalls associated with negatively provoking the character and might allow them to present their requests in the most favorable way.

After interacting with another character for at least 10 minutes, feeling out the subject's personality and traits through conversation, a character can attempt a Wisdom (Insight] check to uncover one of the character’s ideals, flaws, or bonds. The player declares what type of trait (ideal, flaw, or bond] he or she wants to uncover, and the DC is based on the subject’s Wisdom score.

Characters with a higher Wisdom are more in control of themselves and better able to mask their inner concerns.

Increase the DC by up to 10 if the character consciously tries to hide a trait. If the adventurer’s check fails by 10 or more, the player character might misidentify a trait. The DM might provide a false trait or invert one of the character’s existing traits. For example, if an old sage’s flaw is that he is prejudiced against the uneducated, the inverse would indicate that the sage enjoys personally seeing to the education of the downtrodden.

## Resolving the Interaction

After making sure that every character has had the opportunity to engage in the interaction to the extent he or she desires, and that the players have had time to discover all that they want to know about a character’s ideals, flaws, and bonds, the DM can call for a Charisma check. (Depending on the approach the characters take, the Deception, Intimidation, or Persuasion skills might apply.] This Charisma check signals the climactic moment of the interaction, which sets the subject’s course of action with its outcome.
Other characters participating in an interaction can influence it, for better or worse.

If a helping character says or does something that would influence the interaction in a positive way, the character making the Charisma check can do so with advantage. On the other hand, if a “helping” character says something stupid or offensive, the character making the Charisma check has disadvantage on that check.

Once the check has been made, further attempts are usually fruitless, at least for the time being. If the players try to press the issue once the check has been made and resolved, they run the risk of upsetting or angering the subject, potentially shifting his or her attitude toward hostility.

## Intelligent Creatures

Intelligent creatures are creatures that have a value of Intelligence of 6 or more. If such a creature is used as a mount, it acts independetly and can also attack as one of it's actions, as stated in the official rules. Intelligent creatures are independent creatures. Indeed there can be communication between the creature and it's master, however the creatures acts independently and thus have a turn of their own. This applies to also to riden mounts. These creatures are controlled by the DM.

NOTE: The only exception for this rule is the mount from the **Find Steed** spell. Due to the nature of the spell, that mount is controlled by the PC. Whether intelligent or not, each creature is still a beast at heart. It might disagree with the rider going in a certain direction such as jumping great heights. The DM might ask the PC to make a particular check whether to remain mounted or maybe the creature just runs off.

Intelligent creatures might challenge their master more then non-intelligent creatures, especially when the mount is being asked to do something that might hard for it, it considers dangerous or maybe something that it fears.

## Death of a Mount or Companion

Mounts roll for death saves. A dead mount can be resurrected if the requirements for a ressuraction spell are met. This applies also the companion creatures. Potions Potions and other consumables work as intended even on mounts. But so do the harmful effects of negative potions and poisons.

## Companion Needs

Just like a normal PC, mounts and pets have basic needs. They need: Food and Water to survive Rest after a long day To breathe Someone to take care of them Food and Water is either brought along before the adventure started or else it can be scavanged while in session. Most of the time it will be easy for the mount to be sustained while on an adventure, however some enviroments \(such as deserts or frozen landscapes\) will make it very hard and might possibly starve your mount. Normal exhaustion rules apply if a mount is not sustained.

Food and Water Needs

| Creature Size | Food per Day | Water per Day |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Tiny  |   1/4 pound |   1/4 gallon |
| Small  |  1 pound | 1 gallon |
|   Medium | 1 pound |  1 gallon |
| Large  | 4 pounds  |   4 gallons |
| Huge | 16 pounds  | 16 gallons  |
| Gargantuan  | 64 pounds |   64 gallons |

## Official Ruling from the D&D Player's Handbook 5e

```text
Resting after a long day is a big must if you want your mount to remain healthy. They will suffer normal exhaustion effects if they fail to rest or are being pushed over the limit. Breathing is a rather obvious need. Depending on the nature of the mount, different mounts can breathe in different enviroments and cannot in others. Sometime a PCs has to leave his mount behind if the mount cannot breathe in a certain enviroment he wants to explore. This takes us to the following need. Someone to take care of the mount is needed, especially if the mount is not Intelligent. As discussed before, most of the time the PC has to provide nurishment for his mount. If in danger, the PC needs to protect his mount. Most mounts cannot really fend of for themselves but are a very valuable asset when guided by someone. All of the above applies also for companion creatures. In town, adventurer owned mounts and beasts can be left at the stables were all their needs will be looked after. Stables are discussed in the next chapter.
```

## Riding a mount with no saddle

No saddle while mounting means that both the beast and the rider and uncomforable. The rider does not have anything that supports him on his mount. Any check done by the PC to remain mounted is done at a disadvantage. Any attack preformed by the PC will be at a disadvantage. While in combat, the rider has to perform a check to remain mounted if the mount moves and the rider does any other action other then try keep steady

## Combat Mechanics

In this section we are going to discuss the combat mechanics of a mounted PC and his mount.

### Mount Actions in Combat

A non-intelligent mount can take three different types of actions in combat, while an intelligent one can also take any other actions from its statblock.

#### Dash

A mount can take this action to move twice his normal movement speed.

#### Disengage

When disengaging a mount can move without triggering attacks of opportunity. \(Homebrew\) The rider will still provoke an attack of opportunity.\*

#### Dodge

The mount can take the dodge action as normal PC or NPCs can. However, only creatures attacking the mount itself will get disadvantage on attack rolls and only the mount will get advantage on Dexterity saving throws. The rider is not affected.

### Area of Effect on Mounted Creatures

When a mounted PC and his mount are inside the Area of Effect of a spell or effect, the rider can be affected too. If HALF the squares that make up the mount's token are inside the are of effect, and that effect affects in a 3D spectrum \(not only the ground\), then both rider and mount are effected.

### Ranged Attacks while Mounted

Riders doing ranged attacks while mounted will have disadvantage on the attack roll. This also applies to both ranged weapon attacks and ranged spell attacks.

### Animal Handling

Animal handling is a vital skill when it comes to mounts. A rider needs to be good with animals if it wants to ride one. If a character does not have proficiency in Animal Handling, all rolls related to keeping control of the mount and related will be at a flat DISADVANTAGE, no matter all the other roll modifiers. You still get the +/- modifier related to Animal Handling.

Note: A mount summoned by Find STEED does not require proficiency in animal handling since the nature of the spell.

### Keeping Control of the Mount

At the start of every turn, a mounted creature has to succeed a DC 10 Animal Handling check. This check is straight forward. If the character has proficiency in Animal Handling then he rolls with advantage. If the character does not have Animal Handling, he rolls with disadvantage. If he fails the Animal Handling check then he must succeed DC 10 Dexterity saving throw \(modifiers from saddle's apply\) otherwise he will be knocked prone 5ft away from the mount and take 1d6 bludgeoning damage. The mount will dash as far as possible away from it's rider. That will be the end of the rider's turn. If the rider succeeds the Dexterity saving throw, he will land on his feet 5ft next to the mount. He will still have his turn, but the mount will still be spooked off.

## Melee Reach

Mounted combat adds a 3 Dimenstional element to combat. Every creature has his own height. If you ride on top of a creature, you are standing on that creauture's back, hench elevated from the ground by that creature's height. Each mount has a height value stated in it's character sheet. That value is the distance the rider is standing above the ground when riding the said mount.

Mounted character melee weapon without "REACH" attribute:

Mount Size Cannot hit

Medium - None

Large - Tiny or smaller

Huge - Medium or smaller

Gargantum - Large or smaller

Mounted character melee weapon with "REACH" attribute:

Mount Size Cannot hit

Medium - None

Large - None

Huge - Medium or smaller

Gargantum - Large or smaller

**Note:** These melee range restrictions also apply when a creature of the stated size wants to attack the rider who is standing on a mount.

For example a medium or smaller sized creature, wielding a melee weapon without the 'Reach' attribute, cannot hit the rider of a Huge or bigger mount.

To charge, you choose a target that is at least 10 feet away from you. You move up to half your speed to a position where that target is within your reach, and then you make a melee attack against it. After the attack, your turn ends.

### Hinder

You distract or otherwise hinder another creature within 5 feet of you. When you hinder a creature, describe the manner in which you do so. The creature has disadvantage on the next relevant ability check or attack roll it makes before your next turn.

## Attacking an Unseen Target

Combatants often try to escape their foes’ notice by hiding, casting the invisibility spell, or lurking in darkness.

When you attack a target that you can’t see, you have disadvantage on the attack roll, whether or not you know where the target is located. Your attack might miss because you rolled too low or because the target is nowhere near where you struck!


## Describing the Effects of Damage

Dungeon Masters describe hit point loss in different ways. When your current hit point total is half or more of your hit point maximum, you typically show no signs of injury. When you drop below half your hit point maximum, you show signs of wear, such as cuts and bruises. An attack that reduces you to 0 hit points strikes you directly, leaving a bleeding injury or other trauma, or it simply knocks you unconscious.

## Monsters and Death

Most DMs have a monster die the instant it drops to 0 hit points, rather than having it fall unconscious and make death rolls.
Mighty villains and special nonplayer characters are common exceptions; the DM might have them fall unconscious and follow the same rules as player characters.


# BATTLE FORMATIONS

Battle formations are specific combat maneuvers and positioning which grants some benefits or hindraces on the battlefield. From the simple circle formation to the complex testudo, all of them require coordination and some training to be performed. Every formation requires an Intelligence check to be performed, assigned by the DM, that can be done by the commanding officer or by the lowest intelligence member if the group is improvised. A failed check wastes the action and movement of the entire group. A long standing military unit has advantage to the formation, and a newly formed one or one composed by chaotic-aligned creatures has disadvantage to the roll. New Skill: Military training. A character with this skill can apply its proficiency bonus to Intelligence checks made to direct or teach a formation, train people in basic units, recall lore about fortifications, strategy and battle tactics or about ranks and offices in an army. This skill can be learned by Fighters, Paladins and Bards, or people with the Soldier, Noble or Knight backgrounds.

## Arrow Volley 

Difficulty: Easy

If at least ten archers are in the same line, they can release a high, arcing volley of arrows as an action. Rather than aiming at a specific target, they concentrate their arrows in an area, striking anything here. The creatures under an arrow volley must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity Save or being struck by 1d6 arrows which deal their normal damage without Dexterity modifiers. A testudo formation or a high shield wall protect as normal. Because they fire in a high arc, they can ignore any form of horizontal cover, such as horizontal shield walls or trenches. 

## Cavalry Charge 

Difficulty: Average 
Cavalry charges are shock tactics. A cavalry charge starts with a dash from the horses with a polearm such as a lance automatically wins initiative, and makes an attack when enters in its weapon’s reach. If it hits, the weapons doubles the damage dice \(EG: a lance in a cavalry charge deals 2d12+str. modifier piercing damage\) and the target must succeed on a Strength Saving Throw or being knocked prone and trampled by the mount. If more than half the cavalry units succeed on trampling their targets, it is considered a successful charge, and the enemy formations are broken. The targets must succeed a DC 15 to 20 \(if the cavalry is at about the same number of the defenders) Wisdom saving throw or being Frightened and flee of the battlefield.

The cavalry charge needs relatively flat, featureless terrain and cannot be performed on a difficult terrain, such as going up a hill or a forested plain. Also, infantry units can prepare for a cavalry charge if they have reach weapons and a disciplined formation such as a phalanx. If the phalanx readies an action to engage, they act first and the charging cavalry takes double damage and must succeed a Strength saving throw or being dismounted and knocked prone. 

## Cavalry Dash

Difficulty: Average A cavalry dash can be done only by trained horsemen and mounts. A cavalry dash has the same effects as any dash action, and doubles the movement of the mount. Any action with an area of effect (such as an arrow volley or  fireball) requires an Intelligence check with a DC of 8 + 1 for every 10 feet covered dashed or fail. This way, a warhorse cavalry moving 120 feet has a DC of 20. Also, even when the check is successful, the cavalry gains Advantage in dexterity saving throws. 

## Circle/Square Formation

Difficulty: Easy Creatures on a circle formation move at half speed but cannot be flanked. It is one of the easiest defensive formations. Line Difficulty-Very Easy The line is the base formation. Creatures in a line don’t hinder each other’s attacks and can focus fire and prepare to receive a charge. The main advantage of the line is its difficulty to be flanked, the protection of the rear ranks and the possibility to focus fire effectively. A line can move at their standard movement, Parthian Circle Difficulty: Average A Parthian Circle is a fast archer’s cavalry formation. The cavalry can use a reaction to move up to their horses’ speed when an enemy tries to approach to melee range or use a spell. Also, enemy projectiles have disadvantage to reach the formation. 

## Phalanx

Difficulty: Hard

As an action, a phalanx formation crams several creatures in a tight polearm formation at the cost of speed and attack capability. A phalanx reduces the movement speed by half, but allows cramming twice as much fighters in the same space. The phalanx must attack with polearms or spears, or do it at disadvantage. Any creature attacking frontally a phalanx does it at disadvantage, and automatically provokes opportunity attacks from anyone on reach if it doesn’t take the Disengage action. A phalanx can be combined with a shield wall or testudo for maximum defensive effectivity. 

## Shield Wall

Difficulty: Easy Anyone on the front rank of a shield wall has all the benefits of half cover; anyone in the second rank has three-quarters cover, and anyone beyond that has total cover. This formation reduces the speed of the creatures forming it in 10 feet, and attacks from weapons without a long shaft \(like spears or battleaxes\) are made at disadvantage. If the creatures pass the Saving Throw, they receive no damage from effects that require a Dexterity saving throw. Use: This is an effective formation to minimize the effects of area of effect spells, such as fireballs, as the first ranks may fall, but the second and third don’t. 

## Skirmish Formation 

Difficulty: Easy 

If the soldiers in a formation are concerned about large area effects, they sometimes advance at their speed every round and then ready an action to disperse if they hear the warning. When a formation disperses, the soldiers as a reaction can move up to their speed away from the center of the formation, and everyone else moves to a space not adjacent to any other soldier. This dispersal can help to reduce the casualties from a catapult or ballistae projectile or a powerful area of effect spell, such as a fireball. Even if they are in the center of the effect, the creatures have advantage in Dexterity saving throws as they are prepared to receive the spell, as if they had taken the Dodge action, although none of the other benefits applies. The main disadvantage of this practice is that tight groups of soldiers, such as a line formation, have advantage against the dispersed formation. Creatures in a very close formation, such as a phalanx, have disadvantage in the formation check. 

## Total Cover 

Difficulty:Average 
As an action, a group of creatures with shields spends all its movement and form an improved shield wall which grants total cover and advantage on Strength saves in one direction. A group in total cover cannot attack, automatically fails Dexterity saving throws and has disadvantage on Wisdom \(Perception\) checks that rely on sight. If the creatures already are in a shield wall formation, it only takes a reaction to form it. Use: The Total Cover is the poor man’s testudo formation, as it doesn’t need as much training to use. Creatures with proficiency on shields can use it at a command to protect themselves against projectiles. 

## Testudo 

Difficulty Very Difficult 

Trained creatures can spend an action to perform a testudo \(a bonus action if they are already in a phalanx or shield wall formation\). This formation consists on several creatures to form a close formation akin to the shield wall, but with a “roof” of shields too. Creatures under a testudo have total cover against any ranged attack or spell, and the same benefits of a shield wall against melee attacks or spells. Creatures inside a testudo halve their speed, and their attacks are made at disadvantage. Use: The testudo formation is the most effective defensive formation, but it has its weakness: it is very slow, and it is very easy to flank. Also, as the maneuver is highly coordinated, it is impossible to use it without proper training and coordination \(such as a soldier background, military training or the fighter class\): only professional soldiers such as hobgoblins can use it. Chaotic creatures are impossible to coordinate, and neutral creatures form a testudo in twice the normal time. Besides, creatures in a testudo formation have problems to attack enemy formations. Besides, a testudo can be easily broken by massive solid projectiles, such as a catapult’s fire, a ballista missile or a giant’s rock. Against such weapons, the soldiers forming the testudo automatically fail any dexterity saving throw. 

## Wedge

Difficulty: Average 

A wedge formation is used primarily for attack other formations. A wedge formation consists on a reinforced center to break the enemy lines and two “wings” to prevent being outflanked. The wedge has advantage against static or line formations on the first attack. Also, the units moving inside an enemy formation don’t provoke opportunity attacks from them. Use: This formation is usually used by heavy cavalry but also by heavy infantry to engage against enemy lines. Its main weakness is the dependence on the central column of attack. If the formation is pinned down, it can be broken easily and the enemy may flank it.

FORMATION   -   DC  -   TIME    -   EFFECT

Arrow Volley    -   10  -   Action  -   Area of effect 1d6 arrows’ damage. 

Cavalry Charge  -   15  -    Action  -   Wins initiative, weapons deal double damage; it frighten enemies if it breaks formations. Receives double damage by polearms.

Circle  -   10  -   Action  -   Half movement, cannot be flanked Line 5 Movement Normal movement, difficult to flank, don’t hinder attacks.

Parthian Circle  -   15  -   Movement  -   Can dash as a reaction, attacks against it have disadvantage (light cavalry only).

Phalanx 20  -   Action  -   Half movement, provides opportunity attacks against anyone entering a rank’s reach, doubles the amount of units in the same space, doubles damage against charging creatures. 

Shield Wall  -   10  -   Bonus Action  -   Provides half cover in 1st rank, % in 2nd rank, total cover in 3rd; a successful dexterity save prevents all damage from that source \(soaked by the shield\).

Skirmish  -   10  -   Reaction  -   Can move as a reaction against an AoE.

Total Cover  -   15  -   Readied Ac. Movement becomes 0. Provides total cover in one direction.

Testudo  -   25  -   Action  -   Half movement, provides total cover, attacks are at disadvantage.

Wedge  -   15  -   Action  -   Breaks enemies’ formations, prevents opportunity attacks if breaks in.

Straps and buckles distribute the weight evenly, making it easier to move around in this armor. This suit includes a helmet and gauntlets.
Dragon Leather. This leather armor is made from the hide of a dragon. It is extremely supple yet far more durable than standard leather armor.
 
Dragon Scale. This suit of scale mail is made from a dragon’s scales rather than metal, granting it superior protective capabilities and flexibility.

Mithral Plate. This suit of plate is crafted from mithral. It is easy to move in compared to other sorts of metal armor. The dwarves sometimes gift this armor to their most trusted allies.
Mithral Shirt. This extremely light chain mail shirt is made of very fine mithral links. The armor is light enough to wear under normal clothing. It is most commonly crafted by elves.


## Special Weapons

Weapons with special rules are described here.
Bolas. A Large or smaller creature hit by a bolas must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or be restrained by it. A creature can break free of the bolas by using its action to make a DC 10 Strength check or by dealing 5 slashing damage to the bolas. Formless creatures are immune to this effect.
Net. When you attack with a net, you target a point in space. Each Large or smaller creature within 5 feet of that point must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or be restrained by the net. A creature can break free of the net by using its action to make a DC 10 Strength check or by dealing 5 slashing damage to the net. 

## Adventuring gear

Acid. A glass vial of acid holds 4 ounces. As an action, you can splash the contents of the vial onto a creature within 5 feet of you or throw the vial up to 20 feet, shattering it on impact. In either case, make a ranged attack against a target creature or object. On a hit, the target takes 1d4 acid damage. If poured on metal, the metal takes 1d4 acid damage at the start of each of your turns for 1d4 rounds.
Adventurer's Kit. This pack has the basics that an adventurer needs to get along in the wilderness. The kit includes a backpack loaded with a healer's kit, a mess kit, a tinderbox, ten torches, ten days of rations, and a waterskin. In addition, 50 feet of hempen rope are strapped to the pack.
Alchemist's Fire. This sticky, adhesive fluid ignites when exposed to air. A clay flask of alchemist's fire contains 1 pint. As an action, you can throw the flask up to 20 feet, shattering it on impact. Make a ranged attack against a target creature or object. On a hit, the target takes 1d4 fire damage at the start of each of its turns. A creature can end this damage by using its action to make a DC 11 Dexterity check to extinguish the flames.
Holy Water. A clay flask of holy water contains 1 pint. As an action, you can splash the contents of the flask onto a creature within 5 feet of you or throw it up to 20 feet, shattering it on impact. In either case, make a ranged attack against a target creature. On a hit against a fiend or evil undead creature, the target takes 1d4 radiant damage.
Horse. A typical riding horse can carry one rider and most of the typical adventurer’s supplies at a speed of 60 feet. If you have proficiency with land mounts, you can add your proficiency bonus to ability checks you make to control a horse under difficult circumstances.
Thieves' Tools. This set of tools includes a small file, a set of lock picks, a small mirror mounted on a metal handle, a set of narrow- bladed scissors, and a pair of pliers.
Proficiency with thieves’ tools allows you to use them to attempt the following tasks.
Disable a Trap: You can use your action to make a Dexterity check to attempt to disable a trap, applying your proficiency bonus to the check. You must have physical access to the trap’s mechanisms. If you succeed, you disable the trap and can bypass it safely. If you fail your Dexterity check by 5 or more, you trigger the trap.
Open a Lock: You can use your action to make a Dexterity check to attempt to open a lock, applying your proficiency bonus to the check. If you succeed, you open the lock.
Tinderbox. This small container holds flint, firesteel, and tinder (usually dry cloth soaked in light oil] used to kindle a fire. Lighting a torch with the flint and steel takes an action, and lighting any other fire takes at least that long.


# Multiclassing 

## Extra Attack

You gain the Extra Attack class feature when you meet one of the following conditions:
•	You have five levels in the fighter class
•	You have eight combined levels in any classes that have the Extra Attack feature
Once you have Extra Attack, you don’t gain an additional Extra Attack unless you have eleven levels in the fighter class.

# How to Play
Contests
A contest pits two or more characters or creatures against each other, with the outcome determined by each contender’s luck and talent. Contests are a form of ability check, except that instead of matching your roll against a DC, both you and the creature you are opposing make a roll. You then compare the two results to see who succeeds.
When to Have a Contest. Contests arise when two creatures attempt to do the same thing and only one can succeed, such as if both you and a bandit attempt to snatch up a magic ring that has fallen on the floor. In other cases, you might attempt something that another creature
actively opposes. If you attempt to push open a door that an orc holds shut from the other side, you make an ability check to open the door, and the orc makes a check to keep it shut.
Resolving a Contest. A contest uses the same rules as an ability check, except that more than one creature makes a check. Any bonuses and penalties you apply when making an ability check that is not a contest also apply to contests involving that ability.
The creature with the higher check result wins the contest. The creature either succeeds at its action or prevents its opponent from succeeding.
If the contest ends in a tie, the situation remains the same as it was before the contest. Thus, one contestant might win the contest by default. If you and a bandit tie in a contest to snatch a ring, neither one of you grabs it. If you tie in a contest to push open a door held shut by an orc, the door remains shut.
Likewise, if you tie in a contest to hide from another creature, your situation with respect to that creature does not change. If the creature was already aware of you before the contest, you fail to hide. If it was not aware of you before the contest, you remain hidden.
