## Design Goals

1) Provide structure to the gameplay elements assosiated with clothes.
2) Retain the design phylosophy of 5e by making the rules simple and easy to use.
3) Make the rules streamlined in order to easily implement them in any campaign and reduce the bookkeeping to a minimum.
4) Make the rules modular and adjustable so that DMs and Players can easily come up with new outfits on the fly.

## What is an outfit?

An outfit is a set of clothes that a creature wears at any given time. You don't track each individual article of clothing on your person just like you don't track elements of your armor. You can wear only one outfit at a time.

Each outfit has a number of properties that distinguish it from other outfits. There are three mandatory properties: Size, Lifestyle and Culture. Also, an outfit may have unlimited number of optional properties, which may have gameplay effects. 

## Mandatory Properties

### Size

The size of an outfit can be tiny, small, medium, huge or gargantuan. A creature of one size can not wear the outfit designed for a creature of another size. For example, a warrior's outfit made for a medium sized human will not fit a small halfling. This property affect the base price of the outfit as shown in the table 

*Outfit prices per size*

tiny - 1/2 of the base price
small - 1x of the base price
medium - 1x of the base price
large - 2x of the base price
huge - 4x of the base price
gargantuan - 8x of the base price

***Optional Rule. Outfit sizes within the same category.*** Outfit sizes within the same category.  When adventurers find clothing, they might need to visit a tailor, leatherworker, or similar expert to make the outfit wearable. The cost for such work varies from 10 to 40 percent of the market price of the item. The DM can either roll 1d4 × 10 or determine the increase in cost based on the extent of the alterations required. Otherwise, a creature can wear the outfit but it will have disadvantage on Dexterity checks and Saving Throws.

### Lifestyle

People will be judged and appreciated by what they wear so dressing according to one's lifestyle can facilitate communication depending on what your goals are.

An outfit can be wretched, squalid, poor, modest, comfortable, wealthy or aristocratic. This property determines the base cost of an outfit as shown in the table *Base Costs of Outfits*.

***Wretched***. This outfit is ruined and serves only to cover nakedness. Slaves, poorest beggars and creatures who disregard their clothes wear wretched outfits.

***Squalid.*** This outfit could feature cheap second-hand garments and well-worn footwear. People on the brink of poverty, prisoners, beggars wear squalid outfits.

***Poor.*** This outfit could feature simple and homemade items such as roughspun shirts, trousers and skirts. Pilgrims, landless peasants, unskilled workers wear poor outfits.

***Modest***. This outfit could include adequately designed garments made of materials easily available in the area. Peasants, servants, militia soldiers, lower clergymen, ordinary workers, craftsmen wear modest outfits.

***Comfortable***. This outfit could feature well-designed pieces of clothing made of good quality local materials with decorative parts made of expensive materials such as silk or animal fur. Generally speaking, this outfit gives its wearer the impression of a well-off person. Professionals, artisans, scholars, owners of small businesses, clergymen and many adventurers wear comfortable outfits.

***Wealthy***. This outfit could feature richly decorated items of clothing made from good quality material designed for higher social stratas. Successful merchants, high clergymen, guild masters, prosperous artisans, knights in service of a wealthy master and lesser nobles wear wealthy outfits. 

***Aristocratic***. This outfit usually includes several items made from rare and exotic materials and accompanied by a good amount of high quality jewelry. Nobles, royal families, heads of states and the wealthiest members of a society wear aristocratic outfits. 

*Base cost of an outfit associated with a specific lifestyle*

Lifestyle | Outfit cost, gp
---------|----------
 Wretched | 0
 Squalid | 1
 Poor | 2
 Modest | 9
 Comfortable | 18
 Wealthy | 36
 Aristocratic | 90
 
### Culture

An outfit almost always represents a culture in which it was designed. A waterdhavian noble finery is very different from an elven noble outfit of Evereska. A character may choose to dress appropriately depending on where the character is. This property may increase the base cost of an outfit by 2-4 times if its culture property is different from the culture of the place where this outfit was aquired. This represents the cost of import/export and rarity of such outifts in the market.

***Sample Cultures***: Sword Coast, Waterdeep, Evereska, Uthgardt, Northern Dwarven, Calishite, Moonshae, Halruua, Wood Elves of the High Forest, Orcs of Many-Arrows.

## Optional properties

**Faction**

An outfit can represent its wearer as part of a faction. It can be a uniform or an outfit with distinguishing features that members of that faction recognize. A person wearing a faction outfit may pass as a member of that faction. This property doesn't affect the base cost of an outfit.

**Weather**

An outfit can be made specifically for wearing it during certain weather conditions. It is usually cold weather resistant or hot weather resistant but a DM can create or improvise outfits designed against other weather conditions, be they natural or not. This property increases the base outfit cost by 3 times representing rare designs or amount of materials needed to make it.

**Armor padding**

This outfit is suited for wearing it with metallic medium and heavy armor. The outfit must be assosiated with poor lifestyle or higher to benefit from the armor padding property. This property increases the base cost of an outfit by 2 times and represents the amount of materials used to make it.

**Sex**

An outfit can be designed for a male, female or both. A person wearing an outfit that is clearly designed for a different sex may be uncomfortable to wear or attract unwanted attention depending on the social norms in the area. If no property is mentioned, the outfit is assumed to be suited for all sexes. This property doesn't affect the base cost of an outift.

**Unconventional** 

This outfit consists of pieces of clothing that challenge the social norms of a society, or is designed to attract attention for one purpose or another. Performers, street magicians, people with rebellious tendencies usually wear unconventional outfits.

**Mixed and Matched** 

This outfit consits of pieces of clothing assosiated with different social classes and styles which makes it difficult to predict what class the wearer belongs to.

## Creating optional properties

It is easy to create new optional properties for an outfit. Think about what make a certain outfit special, assign a name for this property and give a quick description.

## Gameplay effects of properties

Benefits or penalties of properties can be assigned by a DM on individual basis. Think about what seems appropriate to the situation and assign benefits or penalties accordingly. For example, wearing an Aristocratic Calishite Unconventional outfit in the slums of Waterdeep may attract attention of local thiefs and thugs who might try to rob the character. Wearing beggar's rugs will insure that you won't get access to an aristocratic tavern. Wearing an outfit adorned with goblin heads and skulls may grant advantage to intimidation checks against them.
Determine the mechanical benefits or penalties by talking to your players or making a desicion on your own.

## Wearing armor and outfits.

You can wear wear one outfit and one set of armor at a time. If you wear a set of armor without an outfit you suffer the penalties as if you were not proficient with the armor due to lack of comfort.

*If you wear armor that you lack proficiency with, you have disadvantage on any ability check, saving throw, or attack roll that involves Strength or Dexterity, and you can't cast spells.*

## Selling outfits

Selling clothing follows the same rules as other mundane equipment. If it was not worn or used, it can be sold for 50% of its cost.  In other cases it may be too damaged or worn to sell unless the DM rules otherwise.

## Outfit formatting

**Name**
*[Size] [Lifestyle] Outfit: [culture property]; [optional properties]. [price]*

[Description text]

**City Watch Seargant Uniform**
*Medium Modest Outfit: Waterdeep; City Watch, Seargant; Armor Padding. 18 gp*

# Social interactions

# Exploring & Survival interactions

# Modified Three Pillars System

# Modified Three Pillar

This version of three pillar experience rewards players for exploration and social interaction, while maintaining the traditional character advancement scale and allowing the GM to reward XP for encounters.

Instead of rewarding a fixed amount, for Exploration and Social Interaction players receive a percentage of the XP required for them to get from their current level to the next \(calculated from the base XP of their level to the next, not including XP they've earned in between.\)

They may receive a higher or lower percentage depending on the their tier of play compared to the magnitude of their accomplishment.   

## Gaining Levels

Players gain levels according to the normal PHB Character Advancement table.

| XP | Level | XP to Next Level |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 0 | 1 | 300 |
| 300 | 2 | 600 |
| 900 | 3 | 1,800 |
| 2,700 | 4 | 3,800 |
| 6,500 | 5 | 7,500 |
| 14,000 | 6 | 9,000 |
| 23,000 | 7 | 11,000 |
| 34,000 | 8 | 14,000 |
| 48,000 | 9 | 16,000 |
| 64,000 | 10 | 21,000 |
| 85,000 | 11 | 15,000 |
| 100,000 | 12 | 20,000 |
| 120,000 | 13 | 20,000 |
| 140,000 | 14 | 25,000 |
| 165,000 | 15 | 30,000 |
| 195,000 | 16 | 30,000 |
| 225,000 | 17 | 40,000 |
| 265,000 | 18 | 40,000 |
| 302,000 | 19 | 50,000 |
| 355,000 | 20 | See Epic Boons |

## Dividing XP

For Exploration and Social Interaction, the XP award for an adventure is the same for each member of the party, instead of being divided among them.

     However, this does not mean the XP is awarded for individual merit. XP is awarded when the party as a whole accomplishes something, without splitting hairs about who contributed to what the most.   

### Pillar 1: Exploration

For discovering both Items and Locations, each player gains 5% at their tier, 5% additional for every tier above, none for below their tier.   

#### Items

In this version, players are rewarded for discovering magic items that are of the highest nonconsumable rarity suggested for their tier as per Xanathar's Guide.

| Tier 1 | A single art object or gem worth 100 gp or more, or a major uncommon item |
| :--- | :--- |
| Tier 2 | A single art object or gem worth 1,000 gp or more, or a major rare item |
| Tier 3 | A single art object or gem worth 5,000 gp or more, or a major very rare item |
| Tier 4 | A single art object or gem worth 50,000 gp or more, or a major legendary item |

#### Locations

A location's tier depends on the importance to your campaign, measured by the scope of its discovery or liberation's impact:

| Tier 1 | A location important to a small town or village |
| :--- | :--- |
| Tier 2 | A location vital to a kingdom |
| Tier 3 | A location important across the world |
| Tier 4 | A location of cosmic importance |

### Pillar 2: Social Interaction

#### NPCs

Players gain XP for turning important NPCs into allies, aligning them with their cause or denying them as assets to their enemies. The XP they gain is based on the NPC's power and influence.

      Each player gains 5% at their tier, 5% additional for every tier above, 2% for below their tier.

| Tier 1 | An NPC with influence over a small town or village, or the equivalent |
| :--- | :--- |
| Tier 2 | An NPC with influence over a city or the equivalent |
| Tier 3 | An NPC with influence over a kingdom, continent, or the equivalent |
| Tier 4 | An NPC \(including a deity\) with cosmic significance or influence across multiple worlds. |

#### Role Play

This modified Three Pillar method also rewards players for inter-party role play. The difficulty of inter-party role play should remain fairly constant throughout all tiers of play, so unlike the other categories in this method it is not awarded based on tier. Instead, it is awarded for specific group activities.

When the party interacts in character during a session, each member gains 5%. If the interaction is only partially in character, they gain 2%. If they create a story-changing or divergent moment, they gain an extra 5%.

Here are some examples of these interactions \(obviously party interaction situations are not limited to these\):

The party argues in character.

The party comes to a decision in character.

The party solves a mystery or puzzle in character.

Some party members conspire to play a trick on another party member

Some party members confront other party members about a problem or secret.

The party convinces an NPC to give them information that the NPC previously did not want to give, a significantly lower price on an item, or another form of important help.

More than half the party gains inspiration or role plays their TBIFs.

The party agrees to take a quest from an NPC in need.   

### Pillar 3: Combat

Players gain 85% of the encounter XP, rounding decimals down, divided between them and any NPCs that contributed. This is used for combats, traps, and puzzles which award XP.

#### **Reddit Formatting**

I liked the idea of three pillar experience, but it had many flaws, so I made some heavy modifications. Here's why it's better:

* It uses the regular Character Advancement table from the Player's Handbook
* It allows to DM to award encounter XP
* It rewards players for inter-party role play as well as role play with NPC's
* It rewards players for discovering the rarest items appropriate to their tier according to Xanathar's Guide \(the original required players to discover items above their tier.\)

## The Three Pillars of Play

For an explaination of the three pillars of play, see the original UA. In short, players get XP for each of the three pillars: exploration, social interaction, and combat.

## Gaining Levels

### Role Play

The difficulty of inter-party role play should remain fairly constant throughout all tiers of play, so unlike the other categories in this method it is not awarded based on tier. Instead, it is awarded for specific group activities.

When the party interacts in character during a session, each member gains 5%. If the interaction is only partially in character, they gain 2%. If they create a story-changing or divergent moment, they gain an extra 5%.

Here are some examples of these interactions \(obviously party interaction situations are not limited to these\):

* The party argues in character.
* The party comes to a decision in character.
* The party solves a mystery or puzzle in character.
* Some party members conspire to play a trick on another party member

* More than half the party gains inspiration or role plays their traits, ideals, bonds, or flaws.
* The party agrees to take a quest from an NPC in need.  

## Combat

Players gain 85% of the encounter XP, rounding decimals down, divided between them and any NPCs that contributed. This is used for combats, traps, and puzzles which award XP.

Full encounter XP is not given to balance for the fact that the recommended XP awards for monsters do not take into account that players will be awarded XP for anything else.  Additionally, this means that players must engage with the other tiers to advance at a normal rate.



## Experience for Social Interactions

# Pregenerated characters

# Rumors and bonds - class and background specific

# Factions

Disfavor with a faction imposes disadvantage on all Charisma (Persuasion) and Charisma (Intimidate) skill checks made with that faction. In the case of Favors with large groups, you only gain this penalty when interacting with those of high station such as a general, a king, or the patriarch of a patrician family associated with that power.

* You may use a Favor to cancel a Disfavor from the same faction. This voids both the Favor and Disfavor immediately.

* You may spend a Favor with a given faction/group/individual (at GM’s discussion) to gain the benefits of a one-time expenditure of 3 fame with that faction/group/individual. You may spend two favors with the same factionBto gain the benefits of a 5-point fame expenditure.

Важный момент. Члены фракция делятся на регуляров и нерегуляров. Регулярные члены фракции работают за деньги на фракцию и получают урезанные бенефиты. Нерегуляры обладают большей свободой, и в зависимости от ситуации могут даже отказаться от задания.

Конкретная реализация зависит в каждом случае от конкретной игры, мастера, игрока и задания.
Пример. Белдора Арфист в СКТ - регуляр.

Персонажи в Лунном море и приключениях сезонных Лиги - регуляры.
