Cold Weather Clothing 

This outfit consists of a heavy fur coat or cloak over layers of wool clothing, as well as a fur-lined hat or hood, goggles, and fur-lined leather boots and gloves. 

As long as cold weather clothing remains dry, its wearer automatically succeeds on saving throws against the effects of extreme cold (see “Extreme Cold”). 

Crampons 

A crampon is a metal plate with spikes that is strapped to the sole of a boot. A creature wearing crampons can’t fall prone while moving across slippery ice. 

Snowshoes 

Snowshoes reduce the likelihood of their wearer getting stuck in the deep snow. 

Dogsleds 

An empty sled costs 20 gp, weighs 300 pounds, and has room at the back for one driver. A sled dog (use the wolf stat block in appendix A of the Monster Manual) costs 50 gp and can pull 360 pounds. 

Sled dogs must take a short rest after pulling a sled for 1 hour; otherwise, they gain one level of exhaustion. 

Axe Beaks 

An axe beak’s splayed toes allow it to run across snow, and it can carry as much weight as a mule. A domesticated axe beak can be purchased in Ten-Towns for 50 gp. See appendix A of the Monster Manual for the axe beak’s stat block.
