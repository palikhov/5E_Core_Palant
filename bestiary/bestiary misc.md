>***Dominate Ghouls (3/Day).*** As a bonus action, an Aaztar-Ghola can try to dominate all ghouls within 60 feet. The Aaztar-Ghola makes a DC 8 Cha check; if it succeeds, it charms every ghoul in the area. The Aaztar-Ghola establishes a telepathic link to affected creatures, and they do their best to carry out its simple commands. This charm lasts for one hour. Ghouls under this affect have tactical advantage on Wis saving throws against being turned.

He can revert to his true form using a bonus action on his turn. While in a new form, Adran retains his game statistics and ability to speak, but his AC, movement modes, Strength, and Dexterity are replaced by those of the new form, and he gains any special senses, proficiencies, traits, actions, and reactions (except class features, legendary actions, and lair actions) that the new form has but that he lacks.

## Adran Nalty

[https://www.dmsguild.com/product/304482/Wachter-Cult-and-Leo-Dilisnya-Curse-of-Strahd-Expansion](Adran Nalty)

Appearence:

Adran Nalty is of average if squat like build with a sullen complexion consisting of his waxen skin, dark and wet matted hair and jade eyes. His daily attire seemed to be dulled threadbare robes underneath a multitude of misshapen belts and patchwork leather. His black feathered mantle has a noxious odour to it, as if the plumage had been dipped in old entrails before being stitched together. His look is accessorized with hanging small poultices and the skeletons of small creatures. He is never seen without his obsidian staff that at the top is seen clutching onto a pulsating molten crystal. His teeth, riddled with active decay that accurately portray this man's soul.

Background:

Adran Nalty has been living in the wild for as long as he remembers, taken in at the age of five by a circle of druids after he lost his parents to a wolf attack. The circle of druids in question were not ones of life and blossom but of natural decay. There was something beautiful to him about how both flesh and fauna would disintegrate under the effects, struggling to stay alive until it all disperses in a single last breath or twitch. One may question that fire would be more effective, but that is the one thing above anything that Adran hates, seeing the flames stop the creeping degradation of a blight and overall consuming it. As he became an adult Adran was more proactive at using his druidic abilities to inflict blight amongst living beings - be it beast or man he did not care, as long as he could observe the deteriorating stages of their flesh. It was on such occasion that he had a run in with Lady Fiona Wachter, out on an errand with her alabaster skinned bodyguard. He was in the pursuit of a fleeing commoner, decay already eating through their limbs till they fell at the noblewoman's feet, begging for her aid. Adran pauses for a moment from afar, not wanting to get in over his head, but when the woman instead looked towards the druid, smiles and beckoned him to continue, he grinned widely, baring his rotten teeth before sucking the life out of the hapless victim. Fiona was never one to look a gift horse in the mouth and immediately took to finding out more of the death riddled man before her, learning of the circle of druids he was bonded with at Yester Hill and his desire to see everything crumble to dust. Fiona in turn urged Adran to join forces with her. She could provide him numerous individuals, enemies to her but for him, life to slowly disintegrate. Adran was quick to agree and while the nobleman left with growing thoughts of how achieving her goals will happen so swiftly, the druid himself had other thoughts. The fact of the matter was while Fiona was speaking and working her magic to earn the foul man as an ally, Adran was merely focused on how beautiful Fiona would look while he used his blight magic on her, plus the bonus of a full city for his to decompose... it was so exhilarating. For now he will play the role of an ally until the moment arises that he will launch his own plan of attack.

Ideal. "It's about time that Nature starts to take life from those that harm her."

Bond. "All who cross my path will eventually be consumed by blight. It's only a matter of when."

Flaw. "The mushrooms I consume make my senses as sharp as a blade."

## Ashari Firetamer

Though the tribes of the Ashari wardens are neutral and spurn the "petty political nonsense" that they consider outsiders to be focused on, it is still all too easy to run afoul of the Ashari. They consider the strange elemental rifts over which they are guardians to be of foremost importance, and it is very easy for strangers to take actions that unknowingly disrupt the delicate balance over which the Ashari carefully watch. Though they are generally friendly to travelers—particularly to travelers in need—they are guarded, and do not hesitate to act to eliminate threats to the elemental powers and their own way of life.

Of all the ashari tribes, the fire ashari of Pyrah have suffered the greatest. Their people were all but destroyed when Thordak burst through the Rift of Flame in his cataclysmic return to Exandria. Yet despite their immense hardships, the fire ashari have given selflessly to the people of Tal'Dorei. Led by a half-orc ashari named Lorkathar, a group of firetamers keep watch over the volatile Scar of the Cinder King on the outskirts of Emon.

Firetamers are the elite elementalists of the Pyrah, using their attunement to the primordial forces of the world to not just create fire, not just command it, but tame it to their will. A firetamer of Pyrah is nothing like the manic pyromancers of Tal'Dorei; while the latter recklessly wields fire as a weapon, firetamers use their talent to protect others from fire's destructive power—or to use that same power to destroy those who threaten their people. Firetamers are almost always accompanied by a salamander, a fire elemental, or a small herd of magma or smoke mephits. While home in Pyrah, ashari firetamers use their power to control the Rift of Flame or to control the flames of the Cindergrove.

They consider the strange elemental rifts over which they are guardians to be of foremost importance, and it is very easy for strangers to take actions that unknowingly disrupt the delicate balance over which the Ashari carefully watch. Though they are generally friendly to travelers—particularly to travelers in need—they are guarded, and do not hesitate to act to eliminate threats to the elemental powers and their own way of life.

Zephrah's location in the Summit Peaks has shielded the Ashari from countless hardships; few infringe upon their isolated home, and this safety has bred a certain recklessness within the Zephrah people. Though they guard their elemental rift as closely as the rest of their kin, their lack of stoicism and restraint often earns them the scorn of the Terrah, the only other Ashari tribe in Tal'Dorei.

Air Ashari children learn to fly before they learn to walk, accompanying their parents through the snow-fattened clouds on Ashari-craft skysails (see pg. 45). While all in Zephrah love the sensation of flight, few hone their skills as rigorously as the skydancers. These graceful masters of the wind are at once artists, performers, and warriors; they are beloved heroes of their people, both defending them in times of danger and bringing them happiness in times of peace.

Though they are generally friendly to travelers—particularly to travelers in need—they are guarded, and do not hesitate to act to eliminate threats to the elemental powers and their own way of life.

The earth ashari of Terrah are a stoic people, slow to change socially, and more likely to fight defensive battles and outlast enemies than wage offensive wars. The Terrah stoneguard are the perfect embodiment of this ideal; their druidic training has been augmented by ancient combat techniques, allowing them to hold fast against a tide of enemies. They craft arms and armor from the granite around them, and their magical stonecraft rivals that of the dwarves. It is said that in mythic times, when elemental armies poured into Exandria, that two legendary stoneguards protected all of Terrah against the elemental onslaught for ten days and ten nights, guarding each other while their partner rested.

Today, the order of stoneguards stands vigilant along key defensive points within the Cliffkeep Mountains, warding the Terrah tribe against the dwarves of Kraghammer. If the stoneguard were ever to falter in their vigil, they believe the dwarves would doubtlessly enter their ancestral lands and strip bare its natural beauty in search of wealth and fuel.

Though they are generally friendly to travelers—particularly to travelers in need—they are guarded, and do not hesitate to act to eliminate threats to the elemental powers and their own way of life.

The waveriders of Vesrah know firsthand the dangers of the open ocean, and dedicate their lives to protecting seafarers from storms, pirates, and sea monsters. Though they are not warriors, they are accomplished healers and aquatic empaths, using their powers to seek out and rescue survivors of marine disasters, sometimes returning critically wounded survivors to Vesrah itself. The isolationist water ashari condemn this practice, fearing that the refugees threaten their way of life. The waveriders take their peers' scorn in stride, for they would rather be righteous than popular.

A waverider turns to violence only as a last resort, and prefer to fight in fishform than with their fishing harpoon, using hit-and-run tactics as a shark or their octopus form's natural camouflage to harry opponents. When patrolling the open seas, waveriders skim across the water on personal waveboards with folding sails, similar in function to the skysails of the Zephrah.

The Devil's Strahd , Dark Mother and the queen of all Barovian Hags flies her skull under the misty moonlight

> ##### Short Description
>This document contains a cr25 Version of Baba Lysaga, The Devil's Mother and the queen of all Barovian Hags. This is a follow up to "The Real Devil Strahd " CR27. I felt that the book version was pretty weak compared to the discriptions of Baba Lysaga. According to the lore, she is the one who baptised Strahd into the art of dark magic and was the first one to make a pact with the Mother Night. This version is made to be used only under extreme caution as it is quite deadly and will most likely result in a total party kill if used incorrectly. You have been Warned.
>

> ##### The powers of the Hag
>In this version Lysaga is being empowered according to the discriptions of the lore. The Swamp of berez is her home and the players will have to fight not only the hag but the area itself.
>

> ##### New legendary and lair actions
>New legendary and lair actions have been added to the original statblock. They give environmental,flavour and mechanical benefits worthy only to Devil's mother. The flying skull , the fence arround her hut and the hut itself will make the experience feel more dreadful to the players.
>

> ##### New Spell list and new spells
>The spell list of Baba Lysaga has been adjusted to the power of someone who has the experience of hundrets of years and the favor of Mother Night's chosen. You can also find new spells of previous editions translated to 5th ed. at the end of this file.
>

> ##### Equipment
>As the "Mother" of the lord of the land, Lysaga can only have the best artifacts.The empowered versions of the hut and animated skull will help her deal with anyone that she considers a pest.
>

> ##### The Side quest: A Lullaby for Strahd
>The Lullaby for Strahd is a song that his mother has been singing to him in his youth in order to make him sleep peacefully. It was composed by Lysaga herself when she was a maid, way before she became the hag we all know. In this document you will find the final part of the lullaby that only Lisaga knows. The whole quest can be found here: [https://www.dmsguild.com/product/203914/A-Lullaby-forStrahd](A Lullaby for Strahd)
>
>**The final part of the Lullaby:** The Lullaby for Strahd is a song that his mother Ravenovia has been singing to him in his youth in order to make him sleep peacefully. It was composed by Lysaga herself when she was a maid, way before she became the hag we all know. In this part of the document you will find the final part of the lullaby that only Lisaga knows. If the party uses the Lullaby to incapacitate Strahd and succeed and Lysaga still lives, she will immediately start singing the ending part of the Lullaby, immediately ending the status on Strahd and granting him 20 temporary hit points every round for the next 1d4 rounds.
>
>**Last part of the Lullaby:**
>
>*Sleep now My precious*
>
>*hidden from light*
>
>*sleep little vampire-to-be child*
>
>*We'll rise at dusk and rule by night*
>
>*We're all that is pure and blight!*

### History
Baba Lysaga was the midwife to Queen Ravenovia van Roeyen in her pregnancy and birth to Strahd von Zarovich. Despite Ravenovia's motherhood, Baba Lysaga always viewed Strahd as truly her baby. She planted the potential for dark magic within him. Baba Lysaga's unwholesome preoccupation with young Strahd motivated Ravenovia to exile her. Though separated from Strahd, Baba Lysaga kept tabs on Strahd's life form afar and came to admire him more and more. In the meanwhile, Baba Lysaga performed innumerable sacrifices to Mother Night with the hope that Ravenovia would one day be struck down by a fatal disease. Eventually Mother Night granted her death and Ravenovia was struck dead.

Following Strahd's fall into corruption and depravity, Baba Lysaga kept off the effects of old age through the sacrifice of innumerable beasts. Although Strahd discounts their threat, Lysaga has made it her duty to plague, antagonize, and destroy the wereravens of the Keepers of the Feather. She animated her Creeping Hut from one of the stolen Wizard of Wines Magic Gems.

Baba Lysaga (at least, in her mind) serves Strahd from afar under her own initiative. Recognizing on some level that Strahd would never acknowledge her, Baba Lysaga has never met with Strahd and confessed her maternal affections to him. Instead she wages war on a threat he does not even consider serious. Baba Lysaga resides in the ruins of Berez, where she is spied upon by Muriel Vinshaw, an ally of the Martikovs.

### Special Abilities and Resources
Lysaga continues her ritual blood sacrifice to this day in the ruins of Berez, to where she wards off both the toll of time to her person and the use of divination magic against her. She also has some power over insects, able to summon insect swarms and even transform into them.

Beyond her constructs, Baba Lysaga also animated a giant skull to serve as her personal air vessel.

### Alliances and Minions
In addition to her hut, Baba Lysaga has created a number of scarecrow constructs that she uses to harrass and harangue the Martikov Family and other wereravens. She also mantains alliances with the Barovian witches of Castle Ravenloft and the druids of Yester Hill.

#### Lair Actions

On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), Baba Lysaga can take a lair action to cause one of the following effects. She cannot use the same effect two rounds in a row:

- **Baba Lysaga's Hut.** The hut moves 30 feet and makes a root attack.
- **Bone fence.** Animated bones flow from the hut and form a bone fence up to 50 feet long and 15 feet high that remains for the duration of the encounter. This same lair action can be used at a later time to move the wall to a new location. Any creature that is adjacent to or attempts to climb the wall is attacked by numerous skull bites. The creature must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw or takes 11 (3d6) piercing damage and is restrained. To escape from the wall the restrained creature must make a DC 17 Strength (Athletics) check.
- **Secret's of the Animated skull.** Lisaga's animated skull whispers magical secrets to her. Roll 1d8, Lysaga gains a spell slot of the same level as the roll's result. If the skull is destroyed, this lair action cannot be used.
- **Invocation of Mother Night.** Baba Lysaga ends a condition or spell effect on either herself or one of her allies.
- **Winds of Barovia.** The winds and fog of the swamp swirl over the battlefield, causing ranged attack rolls to be at disadvantage for the round.
- **Blood of Beasts.** Baba Lysaga spreads the blood of a fallen enemy or one of her goats over herself, spending up to 4 of her hit dice(d8) to immediately recover hit points.

## Blightlord Druid

Approximately one hundred years ago, the Rotting Man corrupted a circle of druids, creating the blightlords. They wield terrible powers of disease and rot, tainting the goodly woodland creatures with their magics to create an army of blightspawn.

Though the Rotting Man is no more, rumors persist that blightlords still haunt the forests of Dunwood, continuing to corrupt the forest with their vile powers.

## Blood Hunter

To mortals and monsters alike, the blood hunter is a legendary figure—a humanoid stalker said to embrace monstrous power. Long years ago, a group of mortals undertook dark rituals and alchemical experiments to gain the power of the deadliest monsters, allowing them to better hunt those monsters.

Blood hunters are steely on the surface, but roiling emotion lies beneath that impassive mask. Bestial fury and fathomless sorrow drive every stroke of a blood hunter's blade. Humanoids who draw the ire of a blood hunter are often in league with monsters—or the victims of a terrible misunderstanding. Such misunderstandings are tough to clear up, for blood hunters are the kind of folk to slay first and ask questions later.

## Blumue Huanra

[https://www.dmsguild.com/product/304482/Wachter-Cult-and-Leo-Dilisnya-Curse-of-Strahd-Expansion](Blumue Huanra)

Appearence:

Blumue Huanra is a rather well-fed man in his late thirties standing at average height. His prized rich curled chocolate coloured hair rests past his shoulders. The nobleman is donned in the finest accoutrement; thick black vestments over a periwinkle shirt with white collar fastened in place by an elaborate silver brooch. The cloak he wears over it during abysmal weather is known to have the emblem of his house - an ivory eight-point star with a red cross. A jewelled encrusted rapier rests lazily at his hip, making one wonder if it is for show rather than skilled action when used.

Background:

Blumue Huanra has been very privileged from since he was a child. His noble parents paid for the finest personal tutors that Barovia could provide and he took a great shining to history and the arts, especially when it came to both poetry and story weaving. As he grew older his interests shifted to fencing and he bested every single tutor and opponent who challenged him, earning him a very pig-headed outlook that no one could be no better than he, when in truth everyone who faced off against him lost in purpose, in fear of what his parents might do if their son fell into a tantrum at losing. Once reaching adulthood his obstinate view of the world did not change, more so only worsened. Because of his status and vast riches, people would listen to him with bated breath, be it from lesser nobles to the mere common folk, and because of this Blumue took many liberties at bending the truth to suit his own needs and thanks to his exceptional skills as a storyteller could make any lie believable and trustworthy so much so that he, in turn, believed it wholeheartedly himself as nothing but the truth. Any information that is provided to him he then proceeds to turn it into his own, discarding the pieces that don't interest him and formulating new details that he then passes out at a modest fee. While many people see him as a scam artist, they cannot help but fall for his overly charismatic disposition, which the noble in turn uses to his advantage by lavishing himself with the finest of jewelry, vestments and, of course, his love for rich, fine cuisine all at a fraction of the cost. His parents now far too old to do anything reside within their comfortable mansion while Blumue takes the helm of the family mantle. He currently has allied himself with Fiona Wachter to gain the additional power the heightened status provides him with working with such a well-established name in Vallaki, whereas the Lady herself makes use of the plump noble's network of informants and loyalists.

Ideal. "Those who are truly gifted and blessed will lead the way to those misguided lost souls."

Bond. "Vallaki needs a man like me to uphold both its morale and faculties."

Flaw. "It's a shame no one can be as perfect, enlightened and handsome as me."

## Bone Knight

Bone knights are the champions of the Order of the Emerald Claw. Clad in distinctive bonecraft armor—heavy armor adorned with the bones of fallen enemies—these fearsome warriors command squads of undead soldiers as they pursue the sinister goals of Lady Illmarrow.

***Karrnathi Patriots.*** Early in the Last War, Karrnath turned to the necromancers of the Blood of Vol to bolster the nation's army with undead forces. The skeletons and zombies created by the necromancers were mindless creatures that required guidance. The first bone knights were appointed to provide this control.

Devoted paladins of the Blood of Vol were fused into suits of bonecraft armor, whose magic focused their divine gifts, allowing them to command units of mindless undead. Bonecraft armor can't be removed without killing the knight who wears it, and when donning it, each bone knight understood that their former life was over.

***The Fall of the Emerald Claw.*** During the Last War, many bone knights took service with the Order of the Emerald Claw, helping that name strike fear into the enemies of Karrnath. In the last decade, King Kaius III of Karrnath has done much to ensure a peaceful end to the Last War. Under the terms of the Treaty of Thronehold, Kaius sealed most of Karrnath's undead in deep vaults, and the Order of the Emerald Claw was disbanded. A few bone knights remained in service to the crown, but most were cast aside—still bound to their bonecraft armor and still convinced of Karrnathi supremacy. These bone knights felt that Kaius had betrayed both them and their nation, leading their once-proud order to find a new purpose in the service of Lady Illmarrow.

## Changeling

Changelings are a humanoid race of shapechangers who conceal their true identities behind false faces. Their gifts of mimicry allow them to appear as members of any humanoid culture, playing the part of a dwarf one day and a dragonborn the next. Although changelings can adopt any guise, most rely on a few established personas, each with a developed history and a network of friends and acquaintances.

## Clasp Cutthroat

For all its notoriety, the Clasp is largely a business empire run by smaller pocket families of 'spirelings' who oversee local illegal business and contracted work. Some Clasp are merely messengers, or thrive on intimidation. If conflict arises, and the problem can't be quelled, then the heavy hitters/assassins are brought in to 'clean up the mess.'

When the thieves and assassins of the Clasp need to 'acquire' additional funds or 'relieve' specific people of their possessions, their cutthroats are the first to be called. Clasp cutthroats can also represent any number of different rogues within the thieves' guilds of Tal'Dorei

The Clasp prefers to operate within the shadows, but sometimes targets of blackmail need a little "convincing." Whenever scare tactics and brute force are needed, the Clasp's musclebound enforcers make quite an impression.

## Claw of Sha'argon

The aboleths created the lobster-like chuuls as living weapons and unleashed them against the sahuagin. The high priests of the Eternal Dominion responded by consuming the chuuls and taking their power. A Claw of Sha'argon is a mighty sahuagin champion—an armored powerhouse possessing deep faith and wielding divine power. While barons lead sahuagin into battle, the Claws of Sha'argon are the spiritual leaders of the Eternal Dominion who lead its inquisitions and crush its enemies with claw and spell.

***Claw and Tentacle..*** The powerful claws of a sahuagin priest are deadly weapons. It manipulates objects and casts spells using its facial tentacles. These tentacles are fully prehensile limbs capable of delicate work, but a Claw of Sha'argon has disadvantage on Strength checks made using its tentacles.

***Devoted Priests..*** Only the greatest spiritual leaders of the sahuagin are nominated for the ritual that produces a Claw of Sha'argon, and only those possessing the most unshakable faith survive this agonizing process. The Claws of Sha'argon see themselves as chosen vessels of the Devourer, channeling the fury of the wild. A Claw of Sha'argon casts spells as an 11th-level spellcaster, and those spells listed are typical for a Claw of Sha'argon, but can be replaced with any spell available to a Tempest cleric.

## Eelfolk

Eelfolk are a piscine race with rubbery skin and patterned coloration meant to provide camouflage amid shifting underwater light. They slink and hunt through caves and shoals, carving out territory in bursts of aggressive expansion. Eelfolk often lair along shorelines and submerged caverns, never too far from the surface where they must occasionally gulp great mouthfuls of air.

**Ambushers**. Eelfolk keep to the fringes of the sea and ambush any who encroach upon their territory. While hunting, they prefer to lie in wait for prey to draw close before lunging out to attack. Two pouches behind their necks generate an electrical charge they use to sense their quarry, even in the murkiest depths.

**Storm Worshippers**. Eelfolk worship the squalls of the sea as though they were gods, viewing all storms as divinely inspired. Sailors at sea have reported seeing dozens of eelfolk cavorting through the water during tempests.

**Growing Pains**. Eelfolk grow larger and more powerful with age, shifting from stealthy hunters to vicious brutes. Fully matured eelfolk grow extra electrical pouches that cover their bodies in crackling energy. These scourges are more cunning and aggressive than their younger brethren. They lead surprise raids along shoreline settlements in order to satiate their ever-growing hunger for violence and food.

**Storm's Fury**. During raging ocean storms, the strongest and most cunning eelfolk fight with each other to throw themselves in the path of a lightning strike. Rarely, one lucky creature will be enveloped in a great blast of energy. The lighting burns the eelfolk's bulky body away, replacing it with a gaunt form housing magnificent power. These eelfolk stormcallers gain the ability to channel the tempest's might, summoning lightning bolts and gales of wind to pummel their foes.

## Ernst Larnak

[https://www.dmsguild.com/product/304482/Wachter-Cult-and-Leo-Dilisnya-Curse-of-Strahd-Expansion](Ernst Larnak)

Appearence:

Ernst has the sharp handsome features that would make any maiden or gentleman swoon. Smooth, shaven skin, an impish smile that makes one's heart aflutter and warm chocolate eyes that could tell no lies... His red-brown hair is kept in a somewhat dishevelled manner but that does not translate to the rest of his garments; a dark leather cloak and form-fitted attire that is meticulously well kept. Many passersby will note of the intricate tribal tattoos wrapped around his left wrist with four lines that coil like snakes upwards to and around his middle finger.

Background:

Ernst Larnak is a money-grubbing assassin that serves lady Fiona Wachter. She pays him to keep her informed about everything that happens in town as well as assassinate anyone that openly opposes her. Ernst knows Lady Wachter's secrets, and he would blackmail her in a heartbeat if their relationship went sour. As an assassin, he prefers to lurk in the shadows, hidden from anyone's field of view. Constantly stalking the people he finds interesting, learning the way they live, the paths they walk and what makes them twitch in an attempt to gain an advantageous position against them if time comes as well as sell these secrets to lady Fiona. Lady Fiona usually sends him on boring errands such as delivering a payment to the local Vistani camp for tasks that he believes that he would be more capable than any Vistana.

Ideal. "I only kill for money, I only betray someone's trust for more money"

Bond. "I only serve Fiona because it benefits me, I wouldn't hesitate to turn on her if a situation demands it"

Flaw. "I am loyal to none other than the highest bidder"

## Filnen Gustanov

[https://www.dmsguild.com/product/304482/Wachter-Cult-and-Leo-Dilisnya-Curse-of-Strahd-Expansion](Filnen Gustanov)

Appearence:

Filnen Gustanov has a gangly build and towers over many that stand near him with his over six-foot-tall frame. His attire consists of torn black cultist robes, clawed gloves and an ornate charcoal expressionless demon mask that hides his features. Should he ever be stripped of his clothing he is to be revealed to be nothing more than an emaciated and elderly bald man with yellowed teeth and a withering stare.

Background:

Filnen Gustanov used to be of noble standing in Vallaki, his family name commanding a fair amount of respect amongst the merchants and common folk. When he took over the family mantle after his parents' passing, instead of maintaining ties and putting money into the neighbouring businesses his ancestry has long paid into, his wealth turned into funding his growing library of books on the occult. Filnen had always taken great interest in the arcane arts and was captivated by the notion of engaging in a pact with an Other-Worldly being and having access to unlimited power. While a gifted man in magic, try as he might he was unsuccessful in making contact with a patron - unsurprising, truly, given where he lived. He then, begrudgingly, used the books he obtained to become an aptly skilled wizard. By the time he reached his late sixties, nearly all of his family's coffers emptied from his obsession with joining with the occult, he made a journey across town, ready to visit the neighbouring Vistani encampment when his gaze locked upon a mischievous red little fiend like being that was causing some disarray amongst a couple. Their eyes met before the creature scampered away, to which Filnen soon came to an epiphany of what that being was - a beast formed from that of a pact with a patron! Moving as quickly as his weary form could take him, he followed the creature and soon found it meeting with Lady Fiona Wachter. Not one for tact, Filnen immediately bombarded the noble with questions about the creature and what pact she had succeeded to obtain in the world they lived in. While a bit taken aback by the old man's forwardness, Fiona was never one to turn the opportunity away. Taking Filnen under her wing, she explained she was indeed in a pact with a patron and with her help, she could assist with him reaching his goal. She then went on with her plight of how she had grand changes for Vallaki, and those that followed her yet needed firm guidance which Filnen was all too eager to jump on proclaim fealty in exchange for her knowledge. From that day forth he became her general over the other cultists in their faction and despite how old and frail the once noble was, he had an aura about him that both commanded respect and delivered fear to his subordinates. Filnen had no care for those under his foot, seeing them as mere fodder for the fires. No one dared go against him after he made an example out of the first set of fools who tried - he left them in a heaping pile of charred bones and hard plasma. Fiona has no worries of Filnen betraying her and will offer tidbits of information about how to be a warlock - albeit they are only well-thought lies. The old man is known to be wily and tries to garner secrets from the red creature addressed as Majesto, the imp itself more than happy to put the occult obsessed general through pointless task after another.

Ideal. "The price to obtain unimaginable power is never too steep."

Bond. "Only I can ensure these hapless miscreants will serve their true purpose for the bigger picture."

Flaw. "Anything that could provide me further knowledge upon becoming a warlock grasps my complete attention."

## First-Year Student

A student who has not yet chosen one of Strixhaven's five mystic colleges is referred to as a first-year student, after the one year of basic curriculum that most students must complete before selecting their school. These beginner students are taught by faculty from all of Strixhaven's colleges, learning rudimentary magic as they acclimate to the university's environment. Once a student has selected a college, they trade their plain gray first-year uniforms for the trappings of their chosen school and begin honing—or even replacing—the magic they learned in their initial year with other skills.

## Goliath Brawler

*Well and damn me if I don't tell you the secret to real joy in this League, me lad: Find yoursel' a fight with one o' them goliaths what favor fisticuffs. Dead silent, like boulders brought to life—none of the roaring and grunting of other fighters. Quiet enough to hear the crunchin' when them fists the size o' hams slam into their opponent. Nothing gets a crowd cheering and bettin' quite like that does, I tell you!*— Grogan the Bookie, *of the Brawler's League, to his apprentice*

After the fall of Kevdak and the Herd of Storms, the scattered groups of wandering outsiders took to a slightly less violent way of life, instead focusing on forgotten spirituality and survival in the wake of the Conclave's attack. However, some bands of roving warriors now grow either brash, or desperate, leading to savage attacks and raids on outlying camps and caravans.

Some prideful goliaths are so assured in their own strength that they refuse to use weapons. Most goliaths learn how to fist-fight from a young age, but goliath brawlers go so far as to eschew weapons even on the battlefield. Goliath brawlers loyal to the Rivermaw Tribe usually lead the charge on the battlefield, using their exceptional speed and brute strength to throw the enemy vanguard into chaos.

Beyond the Dividing Plains, goliath brawlers can be found within criminal organizations as muscle, in underground fighting rings, and as personal bodyguards. In Emon, the most famous goliath brawlers have made a name for themselves within the Godsbrawl Ring, representing the Stormlord in the annual holy tournament.

## Goliath Stormborn

After the fall of Kevdak and the Herd of Storms, the scattered groups of wandering outsiders took to a slightly less violent way of life, instead focusing on forgotten spirituality and survival in the wake of the Conclave's attack. However, some bands of roving warriors now grow either brash, or desperate, leading to savage attacks and raids on outlying camps and caravans.

Countless goliath legends tell of heroes born beneath a raging storm. These stormborn grow to become peerless warriors, blessed with preternatural skill with a blade and the uncanny ability to command lightning itself. As warriors destined to become mythic heroes, stormborn fight with reckless abandon and are often distressingly prideful. Little do they know that destiny is a fickle thing, and that the songs of defeated stormborn (or worse, tyrannical ones) are rarely sung by the bards.

Though the fearsome Herd of Storms was broken at Westruun during the Chroma Crisis, most of the goliaths that made up the herd still roam across the Dividing Plains. Many joined with the Rivermaw Tribe, a vast, nomadic community of goliaths, humans, and other free folk of the plains. What few stormborn remain are now part of the Rivermaw. The next generation of storm children, those who lived through the reign of Kevdak and Umbrasyl, have just entered adulthood. They are ready to forge new legends.

## Hagspawn Barbarian

Hagspawn are the discarded offspring of a hag. Hated by their mother and disowned by the human population, hagspawn are stoic beings left to survive in a world that treats them as anathema.

***Wanderers without a homeland.*** Hagspawn are beings of great loneliness. Some are raised for a short time by their hag mothers, then sent into the world. Others are abandoned at birth; these foundlings are raised by their adoptive parents, yet hags and humans abhor hagspawn, leaving them to move through the world alone.

***Strong and resilient.*** Inheriting great strength and a fiendish nature from their hag parentage, hagspawn are physically powerful. They are doughty and tough, having tough skin and tremendous physical resources.

***Capable of great deeds.*** Even the humans who despite hagspawn agree on the legendary feats of arms these beings are capable of. Broadminded folk listen to these legends and see immense potential in each hagspawn they encounter. Given a chance to prove themselves, hagspawn are more than capable of being trusted and powerful allies.

## Heskel Barkridge

[https://www.dmsguild.com/product/304482/Wachter-Cult-and-Leo-Dilisnya-Curse-of-Strahd-Expansion](Heskel Barkridge)

Appearence:

The first thing that is noted of Heskel is his sculpted musculature, followed soon after by his intimidating aura that warns those to not mess with such a man. His face is obscured by an ornate white harlequin mask, only showing his maroon and teal coloured hair. His clothing is a torn silver bodysuit with repetitive black symbols of a broken sun throughout. In one hand he clasps his worn shield with a blood red cloth, and in the other his sharpened scimitar with the hilt wrapped with a teal coloured cloth - the blade itself has an intricate pattern of a black dragon. His exposed left shoulder shows a tattoo depicting a speared crow in flight with blood pooling in the centre. If he is ever to be demasked, all that can be seen is a scarred face with unnatural white eyes of a vistana.

Background:

Born in the Vistani encampment south of Vallaki, Heskel was a free-spirited lad, not seeming to have a care in the world. With such a disposition he had a fairly happy childhood growing up. Unfortunately for his parents, he had a penchant of getting into trouble with his people. Heskel never fully grasped the idea of property, or ownership, believing that everything that the world provided was up for grabs and nothing, not even the clothes on one's back belonged to a sole individual. This definitely got him into trouble with the other Vistani when he took their much-desired wine though he often would make them forget of such anger when he would pilfer the pockets of potential customers. One day his lack of belief in ownership got him in trouble when he took a roasting chicken from an encampment of hunters who, unfortunately for Heskel, had no love for the Vistani as they saw them as lesser beings. He was chased down through the woods. Finally he got cornered and beaten on when suddenly the pain stopped. He could hear the agonizing screams of pain coming through the souls of his attackers. Looking up, his breath was caught in his throat, seeing a beautiful woman dressed in red with a grinning imp on her shoulder. She leaned over him and magically treated his wounds. He soon learned that the woman was Lady Fiona Wachter, a noble from Vallaki who was on her way back from a meeting with the Devil when she happened upon him. Heskel at once became very attached to the woman and asked her as many questions as he could, desperate to know everything about her. Fiona felt her heart soften for such a child, wishing her own children had such an eagerness to learn, not only about their mother but the world she lived in. She then decided to take it upon herself to dote upon the child, teach him everything she could. Multiple times during the week she would visit him at the Vistani encampment, and even bring him back with her through Vallaki's walls. Heskel's own people had no qualms with this, seeing the young Vistana as a way to get access to the town they've long since been banned from. As Heskel grew older so did his fondness for Fiona that as she revealed more of her plans for conquest, he became increasingly worried of those that would usurp, or even worse, take her life. This desperation of wanting to protect who he viewed as his pseudo-mother became so strong that he went to seek out none other than Jenny Greenteeth, the hag who lived outside Lake Zarovich. Pleading his desperation for protecting Fiona, the old woman offered an ornate magical mask, said not to only provide healing to those that are wounded but even bring one back from the cusp of death. Heskel immediately jumped at the mask, not even balking when the cost of ten years of his own life was required for its exchange. No price was too great to protect the woman he adored. Since then, Heskel has been training and honing both his body and mind to be a stalwart defender of Fiona. He often would fool opponents in combat with appearing as if he was a fumbling fool fighting left-handed with his scimitar before delivering the decisive blow. His outlook of no one owning anything has not changed and would still leisurely take things from others, even Fiona's other allies. He especially enjoyed stealing from Jebediah, loving when he elicited specific reactions of annoyance or anger that made the undead man oh so attractive in Heskel's eyes. Despite the trouble he caused to the others, he was steadfastly loyal to Fiona and would do anything for her, even laying down his life like a good son would do for his beloved mother.

Ideal. "Everything the world offers is up for grabs and if there's something you want you simply take it until you want it no more."

Bond. "Fiona Wachter is the most beautiful person in the world and her fire must never be doused."

Flaw."There's no harm in lying. Everyone does it, why shouldn't I?"

>***Confusion Aura (1/Day).*** When three huggermuggers gather in a group, they automatically generate an aura of confusion. All creatures within 40 feet of any one of the huggermuggers must make a successful DC 11 Wisdom saving throw or be affected the same as if by a confusion spell for 1d6 rounds. Each of the huggermuggers generating the effect must be no more than 30 feet from both of the other two; if one of them moves outside that range or is killed, incapacitated, or knocked unconscious, the aura and the effect end immediately. If another huggermugger is within range of the other two, however, it can instantly assume the fallen huggermugger's role in maintaining the confusion aura, so there is no break in the aura's effect. An individual huggermugger can contribute to creating one confusion aura per day. A creature that successfully saves against the aura is immune to all huggermugger confusion auras until the end of their next long rest.  
>
>***Cunning.*** Huggermuggers possess cunning and logical ability far beyond what their nominal Intelligence and Wisdom scores imply. They never lose their bearings in any setting, they are never surprised, and they can automatically follow any trail that's less than 24 hours old. They have tactical advantage on Wis (Survival) checks to follow a trail that's more than 24 hours old.

## Inspired

The rulers of distant Sarlona are known as the Inspired. These noble families are said to be bound to celestial spirits that guide and empower them, but the truth is far darker. The Inspired are the mortal hosts of the nightmare spirits of Dal Quor, and they carry out the foul agenda of the Dreaming Dark.

Any humanoid who can dream can volunteer to serve as a quori vessel. But the Inspired of Sarlona are humans bred to be such vessels. They have no choice in this destiny, since they can't resist quori possession. Physically, Inspired resemble the kalashtar, possessing an almost supernatural beauty.

Most of the people of the Five Nations have heard of the Inspired lords in Riedra—never realizing that Inspired are spread throughout Khorvaire as well. Beggars and generals, mayors and merchants might all be secret servants of the Dreaming Dark. Such Inspired have to willingly accept quori possession, but the Dreaming Dark has long experience in weaving dreams that can convince mortals to surrender their bodies.

>___
>***A Fearsome Reputation.*** Ireena's reputation precedes her, Peasants have heard that the Devil Strahd is closely tied to her and would never risk the wraith of Strahd to fall upon them. Ireena has advantage on intimidation and persuasion checks towards peasants and villagers that recognise her.  
>
>***En Garde!.*** While Ireena has a one-handed Light or Finesse weapon in her main hand, she has advantage on any Dexterity save she makes. She loses this advantage if her weapons are sheathed, she is disarmed, or otherwise not wielding her weapon.  
>
>***Secret Identity.*** Ireena has developed a costumed alter ego to move freely in barovia. All creatures that aren't aware of the disguise have disadvantage and a -3 penalty on any attempts to discern her true identity. This ability doesn't work with creatures that are familiar with Ireena If a nearby creature ever discerns her true identity, she can expend one point of swagger and make a DC 15 Charisma saving throw, if successful the target no longer believes that Ireena and her secret identity are one and the same.  
>
>***Swagger.*** Swagger Ireena gains an expression of her swashbuckling skill, the points in this pool may be expended to perform special maneuvers or class features. At the end of any encounter, she regain one point of swagger. After a short rest, the swagger pool is completely restored.   
>She may spend a maximum of 3 points of swagger on any single turn.   
>If she runs out of swagger pool points, she gains advantage on any Acrobatics check she might make.   
>The following maneuvers are available to her.   
>Note: For maneuvers that require a saving throw, the DC is equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + Ireena's Charisma modifier(DC15) unless stated otherwise.   
>- **Cheap Shot:** When attempting to attack a creature, Ireena may spend two points of swagger in order to perform a cheap shot. If her attack is successful, choose one of the following tricks: Ear Slap (deafen), Eye Poke (blind), Foot Stomp (immobilize), Low Blow (stun, male humanoid only). Status effects from this maneuver last a single round and are only effective if the target is not immune to critical hits and has the appropriate body parts. Once you use this maneuver against a creature, you must complete a short or long rest before you can attempt to use it against that same creature again.   
>- **Disarm:** When Ireena hits a creature with a weapon attack, she can spend one point of swagger to attempt to disarm the target, forcing it to drop one item of her choice that it is holding. The target is allowed a Strength save. On a failed save, it drops the object she chooses. The object lands on any unoccupied or unobstructed square within ten feet of the target.   
>- **Feint attack:** Ireena can spend two points of swagger and use a bonus action on her turn to feint attack, choosing one creature within 5 feet of her as her target. She has advantage on any attack roll she makes against that creature with her next Attack action.  
>- **Manchette:** On a successful attack, Ireena may spend two points of swagger to target the opponent's weapon arm. Cutting deep into the muscle and severing its attachment to the bone, the target's Strength modifier damage with that arm is halved until the wound is mended. This includes damage from twohanded weapons but for dual-wielders, damage from the other arm is not affected.   
>- **Play Dead:** After receiving a damaging hit, Ireena may spend one point of swagger to use her reaction to channel her inner actor and pretend to die a vivid and melodramatic death. Falling to the ground and considered prone. Upon doing so, she makes a Deception or Performance check against her attacker's Insight if successful, they assume she has been brutally slain, and will react accordingly.   
>- **Rally:** On her turn, Ireena can use a bonus action and spend one point of swagger to bolster the resolve of one of her companions. When she does so, choose a friendly creature who can see or hear her. That creature gains a bonus on their next attack roll or save equal to her Charisma modifier.   
>- **Riposte:** When a creature misses Ireena with a melee attack, she can use her reaction and spend one point of swagger to make a melee weapon attack against that creature.  
>- **Taunt:** When Ireena hits a creature with a weapon attack, she can spend one point of swagger to attempt to goad the target into attacking her. The target is allowed to make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target has disadvantage on all attack rolls against targets other than Ireena until the end of Ireena's next turn.

## Ireena Kolyana

[https://www.dmsguild.com/product/226076/Ireena-Kolyana-The-noble-with-the-Rapier](Ireena Kolyana)

*She dresses in beautiful medieval gothic clothes that are comfortable to fight in. She carries a rapier at her side, sometimes a knife in her boots and a cross on her neck.*— Barovian Peasant's description when asked about Ireena.

> ##### Description
>This document contains a CR5 Version of Ireena Kolyana. I felt that the book version was a bit lazy compared to the potention the character has. According to the book, Ireena is quite skilled in the use of a Rapier and a dynamic woman. I thought of making a better statblock for her while staying true on the descriptions. Ireena ,in my eyes, is shown to be very strong willed and stubborn, despite how much trouble it gets her into.Although she is charmed by Strahd, she realises her situation and is determined to reach safety. Despite her tough exterior, her caring nature shines through in her concern for her family. Sometimes she is a bit cold to the ones surrounding her but in reality she is a charming woman who can wield a weapon as good as she can stand up for herself in a verbal conflict.
>

> ##### Abilities
>I have made custom Swashbuckler-ish mechanics which let Ireena utilise different abilities in order to assist the party ( and herself) in the best possible way that she can at every encounter. She might be a 'damsel in distress but she can handle herself quite good. She also has roleplaying mechanics like the secret identity and fearsome reputation that are really important for a character like her who is the daughter of a political figure and the victim of the lord of the land.
>

> ##### How to use this ?
>Ireena should be played as a support character who knows that she is in danger but will not stand idle while others save her. She will do anything in her power to find an equilibrium between assisting the party and not becoming a hindrance/getting in much trouble.

## Kobold Air Cavalry

Kobolds come in many shapes and sizes, many of which have been detailed in other publications. There are a few kobold groups, however, that seem to have flown under the radar of those who study their culture and habitat. The following is a detailed study of one such group within the kobold society.

**Kobold Air Cavalry**. Kobold's adoration of dragons is as ancient as the origin of Kurtulmak, and kobolds are known to provide service, and worship, to dragon kind. Occasionally a dragon may see fit to reward a tribe of kobolds with a momentous boon–a clutch of kobold/dragon hybrid eggs. Strong and agile winged kobolds with breath weapons are the result.

## Kraghammer Goat-Knight

The sheer cliff faces and winding winding mountainside roads of the Cliffkeep Mountains are nearly impossible to traverse by normal means with any speed. However, the Peakclimber Knights of Kraghammer—commonly known as the goat-knights—are enforcers of peace and justice across the mountain range, and their giant goat steeds can easily traverse the harsh mountain slopes and climb nearly vertical slopes at their full pace. These knights are in service to the Allhammer, and often find themselves at odds with enforcing the laws of Kraghammer and upholding the edicts of their god.

Travelers lost within the mountains are sometimes saved by a traveling goat-knight, who is able to lead them through dangerous-but-traversable mountain roads.

## Lady Fiona Wachter

[https://www.dmsguild.com/product/304482/Wachter-Cult-and-Leo-Dilisnya-Curse-of-Strahd-Expansion](Lady Fiona Wachter)

Appearence:

The current head of the Wachter family has the same bearings as her ancestors before her - beauty mixed with wicked grace. Despite her sharp golden gaze that held many steadfast, unwilling to move until granted permission, the rest of her appearance reminded one of an esteemed woman in elaborate paintings; ivory coloured skin, rouge dainty lips that could go from a sultry smirk to a darkened scowl. Her illustrious red mane was done up perfectly, held in place with an articulate platinum headdress with three points and accented with red silk. Her main apparel was a red dress with gold accents that trailed behind her. She wore matching red greaved gloves, the fingertips reinforced and pointed for when she wished to sample how plump her hors d'oeuvres were...

Background:

Lady Fiona Wachter comes from a family that has been loyal to Strahd for many years. Fiona's beloved husband died of disease some years ago but she has preserved his body and sleeps with his corpse every night since. Rumor has it, that the corpse is not only used for sleeping. At one point, Fiona attempted to gain power by insinuating her daughter, Stella Wachter, into the Vallakovich Family by hitching her up with Victor Vallakovich. The incident ended disastrously, for Victor's cruel words ending up driving Stella mad, and now she thinks she's a cat. For her part, Fiona locked Stella away in Wachterhaus after the incident. If Stella should ever regain her sanity, she will blame the demeaning abuse and exploitation of her mother. In an effort to overthrow Vargas, Lady Wachter started a fiendish cult and masquerades it as a "book club". Lady Fiona also employs an assassin named Ernst Larnak a highly skilled man. The one relationship she does not keep secret at all is her (and the Wachter Family's) loyalty to the master of their dread land, Count Strahd von Zarovich. Fiona wishes to bring glory to her family by ruling Vallaki. She has recruited plenty of lowlives to act as her cultists and she has formed her own council of powerful individuals to help her with her schemes.

Ideal. "Those who are powerful must be used under my command, the ones that deny to serve are useless"

Bond. "I only serve our dark lord's interests and I must bring glory to my family's name once more"

Flaw. "Nobody can harm me. I am well guarded and Lord Strahd wouldn't let anyone touch me."

## Lorehold Apprentice

Deep in crumbling ruins and piles of dusty scrolls, Lorehold students—first as apprentices and then as pledgemages—study the magic of the past, searching for arcane artifacts and speaking with long-dead adventurers to uncover secrets lost to time.

Though many Lorehold students bury themselves in old tomes, others take a more cavalier approach to their studies and travel the world to see history made before their eyes. Their magic can range from spells tampering with the flow of time itself to concussive blasts that break through old ruins—to sometimes just bashing things with a glowing scroll.

### Lorehold Scholars
The archaeomancers of Lorehold College draw their magical might from the flow of time and fate and the way those forces shape the course of history. Scholars of this broad mystical study divide between those who see history as an unpredictable jumble of chance and those who believe events form a perfect—and predictable—pattern.

>***Spectral Scroll.*** *Melee Spell Attack:* +7 to hit, reach 30 ft., one target. *Hit:* 15 (2d10 + 4) force damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.  
>
>***Spellcasting.*** The professor casts one of the following spells, requiring no material components and using Intelligence as the spellcasting ability:  
>
>At will: *comprehend languages*, *dancing lights*, *guidance*  
>2/day each: *locate object*, *mage armor*, *passwall*  
>
>
>***Weight of History (Recharge 5–6).*** The professor magically compresses time around up to six creatures of its choice that it can see within 30 feet of itself. Each target must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be restrained for 1 minute, but the restrained target's speed is halved instead of being reduced to 0. At the start of each of its turns, the restrained target takes 4 (1d8) force damage. A restrained target can repeat the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

## Lorehold Professor of Chaos

Professors of chaos wield magic inspired by the ebb and flow of chance. They study the course history has taken, looking for breaking points in the flow of events, and focus their magic into creating breaks that are to their advantage. Whether those breaks are in a series of events, in obstacles, or in enemies depends on the needs in the moment. They crush enemies' plans under the weight of time and lash out with magical energy that often takes the appearance of books, scrolls, and sheets of parchment.

### Lorehold Scholars
The archaeomancers of Lorehold College draw their magical might from the flow of time and fate and the way those forces shape the course of history. Scholars of this broad mystical study divide between those who see history as an unpredictable jumble of chance and those who believe events form a perfect—and predictable—pattern.

## Lorehold Professor of Order

Lorehold's professors of order search for evidence of patterns and predictable outcomes in history. They study the flow of events, learning which occurrences herald specific outcomes, and they trace their magic through those paths of causality. In their exploration of ruins, professors of order shore up dangerous structures and find the safest paths as they search. When confronted, they confound their foes by channeling the stasis of perfect order, creating resilient barriers of force and quashing hostile magic.

>***Spellcasting.*** The magewright's spellcasting ability is Intelligence (spell save DC 12). To cast one of its rituals, the magewright must provide additional material components whose value in gold pieces is 20 times the spell's level. These components are consumed when the ritual is finished. The magewright knows the following spells:  
>
>At will: *mage hand*, *prestidigitation*  
>Rituals: *knock*  
>
>### Actions
>***Dagger.*** *Melee  or Ranged Weapon Attack:* +3 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target. *Hit:* 3 (1d4 + 1) piercing damage.

## Magewright

In Khorvaire, magic is part of everyday life. A chef might use *prestidigitation* to heat and season food, while a blacksmith uses *mending* to perform minor repairs and *guidance* to help inspire their work. Those who work minor magic into their labors are called magewrights.

Far more limited in magical power than a typical spellcaster, a magewright is dedicated to learning a handful of spells, and magewrights cast their non-cantrip spells as rituals—even spells that can't normally be cast in this way. Most magewright rituals take 10 minutes to perform, but certain complex rituals can take up to 1 hour. However long the ritual takes, it requires extra material components, usually in the form of dragonshards.

### Creating a Magewright
The magewright stat block provides the baseline statistics for a magewright. You then add to that baseline by choosing a specialty from the Magewright Specialties table, or roll for one. The specialty determines additional spells the magewright knows, including ones that can be cast only as rituals. The specialty also gives the magewright more proficiencies.

##### Magewright Specialties
| d8 | Specialty | Spells | Proficiencies |
|:---:|:---:|---|:---:|

>1/day: *chain lightning*  
>
>

For every additional stormcaller involved in performing the ritual, the radius of the spell's effect increases by 1 mile, the duration increases by 2 hours, and they can change the weather by one additional stage every 1d4 * 10 minutes. During the ritual, if the stormcallers take any action other than performing the ritual, they must start over.  
>
>### Actions
>***Multiattack.*** The stormcaller makes three Lightning Lash attacks.  
>
>***Lighting Lash.*** *Melee Spell Attack:* +6 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. *Hit:* 14 (4d6) lightning damage.  
>
>### Reactions
>***Thunderous Rebuke.*** In response to another creature the stormcaller can see within 60 feet dealing damage to the stormcaller, it can channel the power of the storm. The creature that damaged it must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or take 11 (2d10) thunder damage and be knocked prone.

## Merfolk Stormcaller

A stormcaller feels the flow of the tides around, currents below, and shifting storms above the water, and can direct this power against those who threaten their people. Working together, a circle of stormcallers can bring down an entire fleet of ships. The greatest stormcallers have powers beyond what's shown here; the merfolk tell stories of stormcallers who can command the beasts of the sea and transform into mighty squids or whales.

***Wardens of the Water..*** Most merfolk stormcallers seek to maintain balance within their realm. Like the Wardens of the Wood, they strive to protect their region from outside threats, but also to protect foolish outsiders from the dangers of the deeps and the manifest zones the stormcallers guard. However, there are stormcallers who view any intrusion into their waters as an affront that must be punished.

***Druidic Speech..*** Stormcallers know the Druidic language, which they believe to be the language of the world itself. Most stormcallers will parley with any creature who speaks Druidic, but they have high expectations of such beings. A stormcaller may ask a foreign druid to help with an unnatural threat or to serve as a mediator in a local dispute.

>
>***Blood Boil (Recharge 4–6).*** Murgaxor chooses a point within 150 feet of himself, and a 20-foot radius sphere centered on that point fills with a burst of searing, blood-red mist. Each creature of Murgaxor's choice that he can see in that area must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 38 (7d10) necrotic damage and is incapacitated until the end of its next turn. On a success, a creature takes half as much damage and isn't incapacitated. A creature dies if reduced to 0 hit points by this necrotic damage.

## Murgaxor

After giving the characters their quest, Professor Lang hands them a file with information the faculty members have collected about Murgaxor from university records. Tell the players the following to give them context about this evil spellcaster:

- Murgaxor is a bullywug who attended Strixhaven 200 years ago. He was a member of Witherbloom College, though there are no records of him participating in any activities or working on campus.
- A mean-spirited, egotistical spellcaster, Murgaxor was censured repeatedly for disregarding safety protocols, hexing and cursing peers, and using harmful magic while on campus.
- University officials believe Murgaxor began his illicit experiments with life-draining magic shortly after he enrolled as a student.
- In his third year, Murgaxor was expelled for using life-draining magic when it resulted in another student's death. Murgaxor fled before he could be handed over to authorities.
- For a few years after his expulsion, Murgaxor was reportedly sighted around the outskirts of campus, specifically in Sedgemoor and the Detention Bog. Authorities believed something about those locations enhanced his magic, but he was never caught. Sightings soon stopped, and no further evidence of Murgaxor's presence was found. Offcials assumed he was dead and struck Murgaxor from Strixhaven's records, as they considered him a blot on the university's reputation.

#### Lair Actions
On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), Murgaxor can take one of the following lair actions; after he does so, he can't use that action again until he finishes a long rest:

- **Clay Behemoth** A clay golem erupts from the floor in an unoccupied space within 15 feet of the ritual circle. The golem obeys Murgaxor's commands, takes its turns on initiative count 10 (losing initiative ties), fights until destroyed, and reverts to a mound of inanimate clay after 1 hour.
- **Earthen Fist** A medium fist of packed earth rises from the floor in an unoccupied space that Murgaxor can see within 30 feet of him. The fist attacks when one creature of his choice is within 4 feet of the fist. The fist has a+11 bonus to hit, and on a hit, the target takes 13 (3d8) bludgeoning damage and is grappled (escape DC 15). The fist disappears if the attack roll misses or if the grapple ends. When the fist disappears, this lair action recharges, allowing Murgaxor to use it again.
- **Necrotic Burst** Tendrils of necrotic energy erupt from the ritual circle and lash out at any number of creatures Murgaxor can see within 15 feet of the circle. Each target must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, or it takes 5 (1d10) necrotic damage and can't regain hit points until the start of its next turn.
- **Summon Mephits** Murgaxor summons four mud mephits that appear in unoccupied spaces within 15 feet of the ritual circle. The mephits obey Murgaxor's commands, take their turns on initiative count 15 (losing initiative ties), and fight until destroyed.

## Occult Extollant

Occult extollants delve deep into ancient legends and seek to solve mysteries that have led other investigators to their doom, driven by an unquenchable yearning to know the unknown.

### Occultists of the Vermilion Dream
The Consortium of the Vermilion Dream is viewed as an esoteric, profit-driven, but ultimately harmless cabal of ghost hunters and perpetuators of urban legends. This perception isn't inaccurate, but the consortium's leadership is obsessed with one set of legends in particular: those involving the Moon of Ill Omen, Ruidus, and the ancient figures cursed by exposure to its alien influence.

The cruelest desires and predilections of the consortium's most obsessive agents have been enhanced by contact with ruidium-tainted items.

The earth elemental disappears after 1 minute or when it or the silvertongue dies.

## Occult Silvertongue

Occult silvertongues are charismatic leaders. The alien mysteries to which they expose themselves can leave them feeling restless, paranoid, and suspicious. They begin to see things that aren't there and imagine conspiracies brought on by fears that others are trying to supplant them.

## Oracle of Strixhaven

Somewhere in the lands beyond Strixhaven's borders lives the Oracle: a wise and accomplished mage, tasked by the Founder Dragons to ensure that the magic of Strixhaven is used to help others and not twisted to evil ends. The one who holds the mantle of the Oracle must not only understand the fundamental truths of magic, but also possess impeccable wisdom and unshakable virtue.

The current Oracle is an elderly human named Jadzi. A graduate of Quandrix College, Jadzi has since expanded her studies to encompass all disciplines of spellcasting, tempering the mathematical abstractions she wielded at Strixhaven with benevolent divination and a return to the basics of magic itself.

>***Blood Boil (Recharge 4–6).*** The blood mage chooses a point within 150 feet of itself, and a 20-foot radius sphere centered on that point fills with a burst of searing, blood-red mist. Each creature of the blood mage's choice that it can see in that area must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 38 (7d10) necrotic damage and is incapacitated until the end of its next turn. On a success, a creature takes half as much damage and isn't incapacitated. A creature dies if reduced to 0 hit points by this necrotic damage.

## Oriq Blood Mage

Oriq blood mages create deadly weapons formed of their own blood. They can also sense the life energy within nearby creatures, making the blood mages almost impossible to ambush.

### Oriq
The Oriq are a secret society of mages who wield forbidden magic in the service of their leader, Extus Narr. Narr was in consideration for elevation to the role of Oracle of Strixhaven, but when the Founder Dragons passed him over in favor of Jadzi, his bitterness knew no bounds. He now uses the Oriq to gather the spells and magical energy he needs to summon a devastating being, the Blood Avatar, to destroy Strixhaven.

The Oriq work in secret, infiltrating Strixhaven to search for the magic their master covets and watch for impressionable students and embittered faculty they might turn to their cause. The Oriq take pains to hide their true allegiance and wear masks to hide their identities. These masks have magical properties that function only for their intended wearers.

## Oriq Recruiter

Oriq recruiters are subtle mages who infiltrate Strixhaven in service to their order. They are adept at blending in, watching for powerful but underperforming mages and students who have fallen through the cracks of the institution. The recruiters approach and befriend these individuals either as potential recruits to the Oriq or as assets who can help the Oriq acquire spells, rare spell components, or knowledge from Strixhaven.

If the apprentice ends its turn in another creature's space, the apprentice takes 5 (1d10) force damage and is pushed into the nearest unoccupied space.

## Prismari Apprentice

The students of Prismari College—first as apprentices and then as pledgemages—see no distinction between magic and art. No two Prismari students have the same style of spellcasting; each wields the elemental magic taught by the college in a way that expresses their personality. In the hands of Prismari students, spells that conjure fire or bend water to one's will become vibrant and expressive showcases, thrumming with creative energy.

Harnessing the elemental forces of their magic requires precision and grace, and some students dedicate themselves to chasing the ideal of perfect control, hoping that by doing so, they can accurately express what is churning within their minds.

### Prismari Scholars
The scholars of Prismari College believe that art is the truest form of spellcraft. They use magic to make splendid art, and they employ artistry to make their magic spectacular.

## Prismari Professor of Expression

Professors of expression embody the flare of Prismari magic. Using continuous motion, fluid grace, and interweaving steps, these teachers channel the elements of wind, flame, and lightning to accompany them. Their magic is fast and beautiful, which becomes swift death in battle, mesmerizing in its energetic flow. Devastating lightning strikes and searing lashes of flame meet the professors' foes head on.

Professors who embrace the Prismari philosophy of expression focus on magic becoming art in the moment. Whether to create a spectacle that an audience will never forget or to strike down their foes in a flash, these teachers impress upon their students the beauty of creation.

A creature can suffer this effect only once during a turn.

## Prismari Professor of Perfection

Professors of perfection combine elemental magic with precise, forceful physical motion. Their sweeping gestures and dance-like steps gather the power of crashing waves, conjure the protection of unyielding stone, and shape great structures of ice. Binding and channeling these natural elements allow the professors to mold their environment to their needs, both for breathtaking performances and to control the fabric of a battlefield against their foes.

These teachers stress attention to fine details, drilling their students on the most minuscule points. The perfect foundation ultimately leads to a flawless work of art, and the professors of perfection produce sculptural and architectural marvels.

## Quandrix Apprentice

The students of Quandrix College—first as apprentices and then as pledgemages—immerse themselves in the magic of geometry and metaphysics. Their ultimate goal isn't mastery, however. Rather, in their projects they explore and expand knowledge without expecting concrete answers.

Immediately after it teleports, each creature within 20 feet of the space it left must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 7 (2d6) force damage and is moved 10 feet in a random horizontal direction. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and isn't moved.

## Quandrix Pledgemage

The students of Quandrix College—first as apprentices and then as pledgemages—immerse themselves in the magic of geometry and metaphysics. Their ultimate goal isn't mastery, however. Rather, in their projects they explore and expand knowledge without expecting concrete answers. Whether students are extrapolating mathematical patterns in nature or engaging in speculative dives into topological formulas that bend reality, their studies blur the line between abstract numerical theory and natural reality.

>
>At will: *guidance*, *mage hand*, *mending* (as an action)  
>1/day each: *creation* (as an action), *dimension door*, *mage armor*, *plant growth*, *polymorph*  
>
>### Bonus Actions
>***Dilation (Recharge 5-6).*** The professor magically alters its physical form until it uses this bonus action again, until it is incapacitated or dies, or until it dismisses the effect (no action required). Choose one of the following options:  
>
>***Expand.*** The professor becomes Large if there is sufficient room for it to grow. It has advantage on attack rolls and on ability checks and saving throws that rely on Strength.  
>
>***Contract.*** The professor becomes Small. Its walking speed increases to 60 feet, attack rolls against it have disadvantage, and it has advantage on ability checks and saving throws that rely on Dexterity.  
>
>### Reactions
>***Avoidant Translation (2/Day).*** When the professor is hit by an attack roll, it can increase its AC by 3 against that attack, potentially causing it to miss. The professor can then teleport, along with any equipment it is wearing or carrying, up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space it can see.

## Quandrix Professor of Substance

Professors of substance specialize in the concrete side of Quandrix philosophy, manipulating physical dimensions and properties of growth. Their magic alters and replaces the equations that describe the natural world, including creatures, space, and substance. Through these manipulations, the professors change their size and the physical form of others, manipulate nature into rapid growth, travel instantaneously, and even fold space into deadly edges.

These professors teach that numbers and mathematics aren't merely intellectual concepts, but that they exist physically in all things. Professors of substance teach their students to wield magic practically, creating tangible change in the world around them.

>
>***Overriding Theorem (Recharge 4–6).*** The professor magically influences the mind of up to two creatures it can see within 60 feet of itself. Each target must succeed on a DC 15 Intelligence saving throw or become charmed by the professor until the start of the professor's next turn. The charmed creature must immediately use its reaction, if available, to move up its speed toward another creature of the professor's choice and make one melee attack against that other creature.  
>
>***Spellcasting.*** The professor casts one of the following spells, requiring no material components and using Intelligence as the spellcasting ability (spell save DC 15):  
>
>At will: *guidance*, *mage hand*, *minor illusion*  
>1/day each: *mage armor*, *major image*, *mirage arcane* (as an action), *Rary's telepathic bond*  
>
>### Reactions
>***Divide by Zero (2/Day).*** When the professor sees another creature within 60 feet of itself casting a spell, the professor can try to nullify the spell's formation. The creature must succeed on a DC 15 saving throw using the spell's spellcasting ability, or the spell fails and is wasted.

## Quandrix Professor of Theory

Professors of theory advance the Quandrix philosophy that math-magical manipulation is most powerful in the abstract dimension of minds, probability, and the fabric of magic itself. Their equations shift perceptions in profound ways, alter probability, and interfere with the formation of other magic. In battle, the professors tweak probability to impede attacks and strike at the minds of their foes with lancing equations that disrupt the opponent's resolve.

Professors of theory hold that altering the way a person interacts with the world can change the world. They impress upon their students to use magic as a tool to shape the overall experience of reality, and in turn make the world a better place.

## Ravager Slaughter Lord

Whether driven by resentment for being shunned by the fairer folk, or consumed by the burning fury that still drives them since the corruption of the Ruiner's blood in the Calamity, most orcs are a chaotic force of destruction. They are a threat to civilization, to be sure, but more a mindless force of nature than a coordinated menace.

However, with each generation, some orcs grow smarter: more organized, learning from their foes, and understanding the might in well-led numbers. This growing horde of calculating, ruthless murder is known as the Ravagers, and with each defeat, they learn. And grow stronger still.

Nearly every orc tribe of the Dividing Plains has joined the Ravagers, and most do so willingly. Orc warchiefs, hungry for recognition in the single burning eye of their god, turn to the Ravagers as a way to fight greater battles, kill stronger foes, and win bloodier spoils. The few war chiefs whose deeds live up to their ambitions soon find themselves leading an arm of the Ravagers—and honored by the title of Slaughter Lord. A Slaughter Lord craves combat like it craves food, and leads Ravager raids as often as possible, but is frequently forced to remain at its stronghold because of its strict regimen of alchemical treatments.

A small army of shamans and alchemists attend to the Slaughter Lords in order to artificially enhance their already-tremendous strength. The blessings and concoctions crafted by the orc-lords' lackeys grow their muscular forms to mountainous size, sharpen their tactical reasoning, and bestow upon them the divine protection of the One-Eyed Ruiner. While their unnatural size is a Slaughter Lord's most obvious martial advantage—it dual-wields weapons most humans could only wield with two hands—the Ruiner's blessings grant it tremendous divine magic. Rumors abound of brave warriors being slain or blinded by a single guttural utterance.

The people of the Dividing Plains do not know exactly how many Slaughter Lords command the Ravagers. Some reason that there are four major arms of the barbarian horde, and that each arm is commanded by one of these monsters. Inside the walls of the margrave of Westruun's keep, however, Margrave Zimmerset and his councilors worry over a graver matter: the Ravagers are too well-organized to be led by war-crazed, drug-addled orcs. Who, or what, is commanding the Slaughter Lords from the shadows?

## Ravager Stabby-Stabber

Whether driven by resentment for being shunned by the fairer folk, or consumed by the burning fury that still drives them since the corruption of the Ruiner's blood in the Calamity, most orcs are a chaotic force of destruction. They are a threat to civilization, to be sure, but more a mindless force of nature than a coordinated menace.

However, with each generation, some orcs grow smarter: more organized, learning from their foes, and understanding the might in well-led numbers. This growing horde of calculating, ruthless murder is known as the Ravagers, and with each defeat, they learn. And grow stronger still.

Tales of the bloodthirsty Ravagers have spread from Kymal across Tal'Dorei. Most adventurers and mercenaries take up arms against the Ravager after hearing stories of muscle-bound orcs terrorizing the free people of the Dividing Plains. They are prepared for single combat with great foes. They are not prepared for the Ravagers' most terrifying weapon: the stabby-stabbers. Fresh-faced warriors from Emon laugh at the name when they first hear it in Kymal's taverns, but veteran mercenaries close their eyes and hastily bury their face in their tankards.

Goblins only join the Ravagers as slaves; spoils from orcish raids of goblin nests. Those that show exceptional skill are brought before their Slaughter Lord and forced to drink a terrible brew the orcs call skullfire. The concoction burns what little reason the goblins had away, turning them into perfectly obedient, flesh-hungry monsters. In battle, stabby-stabbers swarm like rats, eviscerating fleeing innocents and warriors alike in seconds.

## Remnant Chosen

*Cycles within cycles, turning evermore. Do not think that the One-Who-Whispers is gone, and shall return again. That is an ignorant understanding of the Cycle of Inevitability. Instead understand that the Holy Susurrus ebbs and recedes like the tide. When the Tide of Whispers has withdrawn, the initiated are invested with a sacred charge: to prepare the world for the turning of that Tide, for the return of the Whispered One. When that sacred and holy day is upon us once more, the Ineffable Whispers will be heard not just by the sanctified, but by all thinking creatures, and woe, woe betide those who do not fall down in worship.*

Empowered by the essentially never-dying essence of their lord, the Whispered One, those who remain under his sway and fulfill their part in his unknowable schemes are granted secret knowledge and powers that strip away the perceived fallacies of society and the world around them, baring the terrible truths that only aid to further indoctrinate the faithful.

All followers of the Whispered One are zealous followers of their god-to-be. Every cultist spends hours in silent meditation, hoping to hear their long-dead master whisper a commandment from beyond the veil. For most, this meditation is fruitless.

But some do hear the whispers. In the silence of their meditation, the spectral voice of the Whispered One worms its way into their emptied minds, filling their heads with words of power. Fragments of the Whispered One's ancient arcane might boils within their blood, granting them spells unseen since the Age of Arcanum.

>Once per turn, the cultist may choose to wound its target. At the start of each of the wounded creature's turns, it takes 1d4 necrotic damage for each time the cultist wounded it, and it can then make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, ending the effect of all such wounds on itself on a success. Alternatively, the wounded creature, or a creature within 5 feet of it, can use an action to make a DC 15 Wisdom (Medicine) check, ending the effect of such wounds on it on a success.

All cultists of the Whispered One endure horrific rites of initiation that forever shackle them to the will of the cult leaders. Every cultist can feel the presence of their foul god just beyond the fabric of the physical world, and many claim to hear him speaking to them when the rest of the world is silent, urging them to prepare for his resurrection, either by secretly molding society to accept his return, or by concocting rituals that hasten his rebirth.

## Sahuagin Warlock of Uk'otoa

The slumbering leviathan Uk'otoa preys on the fears and ambitions of humanoids that brave the depths of the Lucidian Ocean. Countless communities of sahuagin inhabit uncharted pockets of water along the Menagerie Coast, and the most ambitious among them often hear the call of the leviathan in their dreams, urging them to take his power and use it to achieve their bloodsoaked dreams.

Sahuagin who answer the call of Uk'otoa tend to have one ambition in common: vengeance against the land dwellers of the Clovis Concord for daring to sail oceans that do not belong to them. As these devotees receive dark boons from their leviathan lord, other sahuagin begin to gather to their side, drawn to their displays of power and seeking their own pathway to power. Over time, these warlocks eventually become empty husks, mere receptacles for Uk'otoa's power, and puppets that the slumbering leviathan can control as he pleases.

## Scholarly Agent

Scholarly agents are low-ranking members of an academic organization. They know a few tricks to help them avoid danger, and they study magic that enables them to decipher secrets of the past and identify magical relics.

### Scholars of Allsight
The Allegiance of Allsight is a scholarly faction that operates primarily within the Marquesian metropolis of Ank'Harel. Though most members of the allegiance are academics unfamiliar with combat, the faction's field agents are skilled archaeologists who are also trained to contend with and overcome the threats that lurk in the depths of Exandria.

If the target is a creature, it can make a DC 13 Strength saving throw to resist the effect and is not pushed on a successful save.

## Scholarly Excavator

Field research is often dangerous work, especially when it involves ancient magic and monster-infested ruins. Scholarly excavators are trained to deal with those dangers, adept at protecting their allies and clearing obstacles from their path.

## Shifter

Shifters are tied to primal spirits, which most of them refer to as the beast within. They are lithe of form and have bestial features: large eyes, flat noses, pointed ears, and light fur over much of their bodies. When a shifter fully embraces the beast within by "shifting," these features become even more pronounced.

## Silverquill Apprentice

Stylish and driven, the students of Silverquill College—first as apprentices and then as pledgemages—cut imposing figures on campus. Dressed in smartly trimmed black-and-white uniforms, these budding mages practice bolstering speeches and wield inky blades.

Some Silverquill students prefer the benevolent side of language, using their words to uplift their friends and illuminate harsh truths about those in power. Others, though, choose to wield words more ruthlessly and master the art of insults and discouragement (and in some cases, petty trash talk). Regardless, nearly all members of Silverquill College carry themselves with a fearsome, never-second-place attitude—because in the art of wielding words, confidence is key.

## Silverquill Professor of Shadow

Professors of shadow wield the linguistic magic of Silverquill College through slicing wit and debilitating inky shadow. Whether weaving their magic through spoken incantations and scathing insults or through shadows, these teachers break down the resolve of their foes.

The professors strive to carry themselves as immaculately as possible, seeking to overawe and wrong-foot anyone who would stand against them in debate or in battle. In teaching their students, professors of shadow focus on words that find the tiniest, most invisible cracks in an opponent's defenses and break them.

>***Blood Whip.*** A skelzis vicious blood whip causes wounds that bleed profusely. A creature must make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw every time it takes damage from a blood whip. If the saving throw fails, the wound is bleeding freely and the creature takes 4 (1d4 + 2) damage at the start of each of its turns. Bleeding continues for 1d6 rounds unless it is ended early with magical healing. Bleeding is also stopped if the affected creature or another creature adjacent to it binds the wound by spending an action and making a successful DC 12 Wisdom (Medicine) check. Every bleeding wound causes additional damage and must be treated separately; a character that was struck three times by blood whips, for example, takes 7 (3d4 + 6) damage at the start of its next turn if none of those wounds are treated before then. A blood whip behaves as a normal whip when wielded by anyone who is not a skelzi.

## Spirit Folk Priest of Bhalla

The spirit folk are a people descended from human and guardian spirit ancestors. They are rare and most often found in the mountains or near riverbeds.

***At home in two worlds.*** Spirit folk have a close affinity to the natural environment. As descendents of the guardian spirits of Rashemen, they feel equally at home in the natural world or in the small towns and cities of this region.

***Serene and wise.*** Those who encounter spirit folk often remark on their effervescent joy for life. Spirit folk are deeply engaged in life and see themselves as rooted and belonging to the world, not at odds with it. This continent awakens both envy and admiration in those whom they encounter.

***Long lived travellers.*** Spirit folk can live up to 400 years. During their long lives, some engage the human world directly, living within communities acting as clerics of local gods or trusted councillors. To avoid becoming too heavily relied upon, most spirit folk only stay in a settlement for the duration of one human generation, then leave to find a new home where they might contribute.

## Talithe Val'Shiar

Talithe Val'Shiar is an illuminator who uses the secrets of the stars to gain personal power and comfort. She is always on the lookout for adventurers to serve as disposable minions but prefers to meet with them at night when her power is strongest.

Val'Shiar may be willing to join forces with a group of adventurers on two conditions. First, they must be pursuing a mission that aligns with her own goals, such as exploring ruins where she believes she can find magical items or knowledge specifically useful to her. Second, she must have an equal voice in the group's decisions and an equal share in the spoils. Anything less would be an insult to her prowess and to her considerable ego.

## Tarkanan Assassin

Tarkanan assassins are the elite killers, spies, and thieves who work for House Tarkanan, a criminal organization specializing in theft and assassination. In addition to their deadly skill, a Tarkanan assassin possesses an aberrant dragonmark—a twisted sigil that provides them with magical power. House Tarkanan actively seeks and recruits people with aberrant dragonmarks.

> ##### Aberrant Dragonmark Innate Spells
>The power granted by an aberrant dragonmark is unpredictable. When running a Tarkanan assassin, you can roll on the Aberrant Dragonmark Innate Spells table to determine the spells gained from that NPC's aberrant mark, replacing the spells in the stat block's Innate Spellcasting trait.

## The Lord of Blades

The Lord of Blades is a warforged warlord who has broken all ties with his former masters. He has established a nation for his people deep in the Mournland, centered in a great fortress where warforged from all over Khorvaire can come and feel a sense of belonging. No one knows what the Lord of Blades plans for his followers, but many fear that he intends to build a legion of warforged zealots, primed to march from the Mournland to unleash destruction on their former masters.

Some tales assert that the Lord of Blades led the warforged armies of Cyre in the Last War. Others cast him as a newer warforged, perhaps the last to come out of the Cannith creation forges before the Thronehold Accords led to their dismantling. One story claims the Lord of Blades caused the destruction of Cyre and warns that he plans to repeat the Day of Mourning in each of the remaining Five Nations. Whatever the truth, he has become a beacon for warforged everywhere.

***Warforged Nature.*** The Lord of Blades doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.

---

The Uthgardt are suspicious and resentful of most kinds of magic. Seldom do they choose to become shamans. Instead, the role is thrust upon those who are born with a strong connection to the spirit world. To be a shaman is to stand with one foot in the land of the living and the other in the land of the dead. Those who walk the shadowed path between two lands do so because the spirits of the dead compel them. Other Uthgardt fear and respect a shaman's power.

An Uthgardt shaman must possess a sacred bundle to cast spells. A sacred bundle is made up of sticks, bones, feathers, tufts of fur, and stones that have been "touched" by spirits. It takes a month for a shaman to assemble a sacred bundle, and a shaman can use only one such bundle at a time. A sacred bundle benefits only the shaman who created it, and it doesn't replace the normal components of a spell.

In addition to the spells that all Uthgardt shamans can cast, a shaman of a particular tribe gains additional spells based on tribal affiliation (see the "Uthgardt Sha man Tribal Spells" sidebar).

By communing with their ancestors' spirits, Uthgardt shamans can also learn secret rituals. These rituals almost always require some sort of blood sacrifice, and their effects are usually transformative. For example, some Black Raven shamans know a ritual that allows them to hatch giant ravens from normal raven eggs, and some shamans of the Griffon tribe can transform them selves into griffons by performing a ritual that requires them to drink copious amounts of horse blood.

***Uthgardt Shaman Tribal Spells.*** Depending on an Uthgardt shaman's tribe, the shaman's Innate Spellcasting feature gains additional spells the shaman can cast once per day.

Black Lion: *chill touch*, *feign death*, *revivify*

Black Raven: *animal messenger* (raven only), *polymorph* (self only; into a raven only)

Blue Bear: *enhance ability* (bear's endurance only), *heroism*

Elk: *find steed* (cast as 1 action; elk only), *haste*

Gray Wolf: *beast sense* (wolf or dire wolf only), *moonbeam*, *speak with animals* (wolf or dire wolf only)

Great Worm: *crusader's mantle*, *hypnotic pattern*

Griffon: *beast sense* (birds only), *fly*

Red Tiger: *enhance ability* (cat's grace only), *jump*

Thunderbeast: *enhance ability* (bull's strength only), *pass without trace*

Tree Ghost: *barkskin*, *speak with plants*

## Wachter Cultist

[https://www.dmsguild.com/product/304482/Wachter-Cult-and-Leo-Dilisnya-Curse-of-Strahd-Expansion](Wachter Cultist)

Appearence:

Wachter cultists usually wear dark robes with the Wachter sigil sewed inside of the robe. They wield daggers, wooden blunts, sickles, pitchforks, torches and other makeshift weapons while the most fortunate ones wield scimitars.

Background:

Wachter Cultist swear allegiance to Lady Fiona Wachter and of course to the Devil himself, Strahd Von Zarovich. As long as Fiona is not the leader of Vallaki, most conceal their loyalties to avoid being ostracized, imprisoned, or executed for their beliefs. The Wachter Cultists often show signs of insanity in their beliefs and practices, a trait that Fiona and her council exploit happily. In order to compensate for their lack of skills and gear, lady Fiona has spent quite a sum of golden coins to boost up their combat abillities by offering the most important of them, a magic dark wand that lets them cast basic magic and a consumable such as a healing potion, a jar of spiders, an alchemist or an acid flask.

Background:

Fooled by false promises and tricked by unexplainable bizarre phenomenons that Lady Fiona creates, these flocks of demented cultists rally under her banner. Giving over their body and soul to their master, they have no self preservation and spread mayhem and chaos in their wake. Their goal is to allow Lady Fiona rule over Vallaki and to usurp her enemies. If they succeed, they were promised to be regarded as superior to all other Vallaki residents. The cultist mob is such a dangerous encounter due to the fact that when the killing frenzy starts, they disregard they personal safety and in a panickly rage consume everyone in their path.

## Warforged Soldier

Warforged soldiers are humanoids formed from wood and steel, then magically imbued with life and sentience. The warforged were created to fight in the Last War, and in the aftermath of that conflict, they struggle to understand their place in the world.

Most warforged soldiers still serve their former masters, often guarding dragonmarked houses or merchant caravans. Many warforged find it difficult to separate themselves from the soldiers they were made to be, seeking work as bouncers, bailiffs, and bodyguards. Others put their tireless strength to work as laborers, committed to the reconstruction of the towns and cities they defended or destroyed in the war.

## Werespider

Werespiders are graceful, slender lycanthropes straight from many people's worst nightmares. When they are at rest, werespiders sit perfectly still in dark corners.

**Patient Assassins**. Werespiders are stealthy assassins with cold and distant personalities. They are extremely patient and can wait unmoving for days in a small space to ambush their prey. In their humanoid and hybrid forms, werespiders prefer light and ranged weapons and use surprise to bring down enemies.

**Scourge of the Underdark**. Werespiders are most common in the Underdark. Duergar and svirfneblin who become werespiders will usually leave their cities and wander the tunnels of the Underdark, staying in their hybrid or beast form to keep away predators. Some even head to the surface where finding prey is easier. Drow who become cursed remain in civilization and are open about their lycanthropy, claiming the condition is a blessing from Lolth.

## Witherbloom Apprentice

Deep in the fog and muck of the swamp, the students of Witherbloom College—first as apprentices and then as pledgemages—study the cycle of life and death. Their magic is fueled by what they call life essence: the ubiquitous energy that runs through living things.

Witherbloom students learn how to concoct magical potions and talismans, in addition to their spellcasting studies. Their magic ranges from necrotic shadows and withering bursts of poison to flourishing bursts of plant life.

## Witherbloom Professor of Decay

Professors of decay wield magic that drains and twists the essence of the professors' subjects. The professors use the gathered essence to feed their magic, snuffing the life and decaying the bodies of the living, entreating and commanding the dead and Undead, and twisting curses around their foes. In battle, they steal the essence of their enemies to heal their own wounds and create spears of sickly green life-draining energy.

Witherbloom teachers who espouse the decaying side of the natural cycle instruct their students to exploit the essence of life for their own needs. Professors of decay unravel the mysteries of death and the transition of decay, and they teach that any life's end is an asset waiting to be tapped.

## Witherbloom Professor of Growth

Professors of growth nurture the essence of nature through their magic. They brew infusions of plants, fungi, and insects or other minuscule creatures that thrum with the essence of life, using these infusions to fuel their magic instead of using traditional material components. In battle, they flood their allies with vital essence, healing wounds and soothing ailments. Their foes face the wrath of nature itself, from grasping plants and conjured poisonous vines to avatars of nature's wrath.

These professors teach their students to focus on the growth side of the natural cycle of life and death and to avoid wasting resources. They espouse the philosophy that a thriving system benefits all.

### Witherbloom Scholars
Witherbloom College studies the magic inherent in the natural cycle of life and death. Witherbloom professors approach the philosophy from different directions, with one methodology focusing on decay and the other dealing with growth.

On a failed save, a creature takes 38 (7d10) necrotic damage and is incapacitated until the end of its next turn. On a success, a creature takes half as much damage and isn't incapacitated.

A creature restrained by the tentacles can use its action to make either a DC 13 Strength (Athletics) check or a DC 13 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check, ending the restrained condition on itself on a success.

## Y'demi

The Oriq are a secret society of mages who wield forbidden magic in the service of their leader, Extus Narr. Narr was in consideration for elevation to the role of Oracle of Strixhaven, but when the Founder Dragons passed him over in favor of Jadzi, his bitterness knew no bounds. He now uses the Oriq to gather the spells and magical energy he needs to summon a devastating being, the Blood Avatar, to destroy Strixhaven.

The Oriq work in secret, infiltrating Strixhaven to search for the magic their master covets and watch for impressionable students and embittered faculty they might turn to their cause. The Oriq take pains to hide their true allegiance and wear masks to hide their identities. These masks have magical properties that function only for their intended wearers.

### Oriq Blood Mage
Oriq blood mages create deadly weapons formed of their own blood. They can also sense the life energy within nearby creatures, making the blood mages almost impossible to ambush.
