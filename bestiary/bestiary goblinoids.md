## Booyahg Booyahg Booyahg

This goblin is a sorcerer with the wild magic origin whose every casting, including cantrips, is accompanied by a wild magic surge. Each time the goblin casts a spell, there is an accompanying surge of wild magic; roll on the Wild Magic Surge table in the *Player's Handbook* to determine the wild magic effect.

### Booyahgs
Spellcasters of any sort among the goblins are rare. Goblins typically lack the intelligence and patience needed to learn and practice wizardry, and they fare poorly even when given access to the necessary training and knowledge. Sorcerers are less prevalent among them than in many other races, and Khurgorbaeyag seems to dislike sharing his divine power with his followers. And although many goblins would readily offer anything to have the abilities of a warlock, the patrons that grant such power know a goblin is unlikely to be able to uphold its end of any bargain.

Even when a goblin is born with the ability to become a spellcaster, the knowledge and talent necessary to carry on the tradition rarely persists for more than a couple of generations. Because they have so little experience with magic, goblins make no distinction between its forms. To them all magic is "booyahg," and the word is part of the name they give to any of its practitioners.

A goblin with access to booyahg becomes a member of the lashers and can often rise to the role of boss.

## Bugbear

Bugbears are born for battle and mayhem. Surviving by raiding and hunting, they bully the weak and despise being bossed around, but their love of carnage means they will fight for powerful masters if bloodshed and treasure are assured.

***Goblinoids.*** Bugbears are often found in the company of their cousins, hobgoblins and goblins. Bugbears usually enslave goblins they encounter, and they bully hobgoblins into giving them gold and food in return for serving as scouts and shock troops. Even when paid, bugbears are at best unreliable allies, yet goblins and hobgoblins understand that no matter how much bugbears might drain a tribe of resources, these creatures are a potent force.

***Followers of Hruggek.*** Bugbears worship Hruggek, a lesser god who dwells on the plane of Acheron. In the absence of their goblinoid kin, bugbears form loose war bands, each one led by its fiercest member. Bugbears believe that when they die, their spirits have a chance to fight at Hruggek's side. They try to prove themselves worthy by defeating as many foes as possible.

***Venal Ambushers.*** Despite their intimidating builds, bugbears move with surprising stealth. They are fond of setting ambushes and flee when outmatched. They are dependable mercenaries as long as they are supplied food, drink, and treasure, but a bugbear forgets any bond when its life is on the line. A wounded member of a bugbear band might be left behind to help the rest of the band escape. Afterward, that bugbear might help pursuers track down its former companions if doing so saves its life.

BUGBEAR's TACTICS (read the article)

DESCRIPTION

Bugbears are giant, hairy cousins of goblins who frequent the same areas as their smaller relatives.

Bugbears are large and very muscular, standing 7' tall. Their hides range from light yellow to yellow brown and their thick coarse hair varies in color from brown to brick red. Though vaguely humanoid in appearance, bugbears seem to contain the blood of some large carnivore. Their eyes recall those of some savage bestial animal, being greenish white with red pupils, while their ears are wedge shaped, rising from the top of their heads. A bugbear's mouth is full of long sharp fangs.

Bugbears have a nose much like that of a bear with the same fine sense of smell. It is this feature which earned them their name, despite the fact that they are not actually related to bears in any way. Their tough leathery hide and long sharp nails also look something like those of a bear, but are far more dexterous.

The typical bugbear's sight and hearing are exceptional, and they can move with amazing agility when the need arises. Bugbear eyesight extends somewhat into the infrared, giving them darkvision out to 60 feet.

The bugbear language is a foul sounding mixture of gestures, grunts, and snarls which leads many to underestimate the intelligence of these creatures. In addition, most bugbears can speak the language of goblins and hobgoblins.

HABITAT / SOCIETY

Bugbears prefer to live in caves and in underground locations. A lair may consist of one large cavern or a group of caverns. They are well-adapted to this life, since they operate equally well in daylight and darkness.

Leader

If a lair is uncovered and 12 or more bugbears are encountered they will have a leader. These individuals have 38 hit points (7d8+7), Armor Class of 17 and Strength 17.

Chief

If 24 or more bugbears are encountered, they will have a chief in addition to their leaders. Chiefs have 50 hit points (9d8+9), Armor Class of 18, and Strength 18. Each chief will also have a sub-chief who is identical to the leaders described above.

In a lair, half of the bugbears will be females and young who will not fight except in a life or death situation. If they are forced into combat, the females attack as hobgoblins and the young as kobolds.

The species survives primarily by hunting. They have no compunctions about eating anything they can kill, including humans, goblins, and any monsters smaller than themselves. They are also fond of wine and strong ale, often drinking to excess.

Bugbears are territorial, and the size of the domains vary with the size of the group and its location. It may be several square miles in the wilderness, or a narrow, more restricted area in an underground region.

Intruders are considered a valuable source of food and treasure, and bugbears rarely negotiate. On occasion, they will parley if they think they can gain something exceptional by it. Bugbears sometimes take prisoners to use as slaves.

Extremely greedy, bugbears love glittery, shiny objects and weapons. They are always on the lookout to increase their hoards of coins, gems, and weapons through plunder and ambush.

ECOLOGY

Bugbears have two main goals in life: survival and treasure. They are superb carnivores, winnowing out the weak and careless adventurer, monster and animal. Goblins are always on their toes when bugbears are present, for the weak or stupid quickly end up in the stewpot.

## Bugbear Beastlord

This cunning bugbear is a beast master who can command and summon **giant rats**, **wolves**, and **worgs**. It often leads hunting and raiding parties and serve as its tribes' foremost scout and tracker.

Bugbears are born for battle and mayhem. Surviving by raiding and hunting, they bully the weak and despise being bossed around, but their love of carnage means they will fight for powerful masters if bloodshed and treasure are assured.

***Goblinoids.*** Bugbears are often found in the company of their cousins, hobgoblins and goblins. Bugbears usually enslave goblins they encounter, and they bully hobgoblins into giving them gold and food in return for serving as scouts and shock troops. Even when paid, bugbears are at best unreliable allies, yet goblins and hobgoblins understand that no matter how much bugbears might drain a tribe of resources, these creatures are a potent force.

***Followers of Hruggek.*** Bugbears worship Hruggek, a lesser god who dwells on the plane of Acheron. In the absence of their goblinoid kin, bugbears form loose war bands, each one led by its fiercest member. Bugbears believe that when they die, their spirits have a chance to fight at Hruggek's side. They try to prove themselves worthy by defeating as many foes as possible.

***Venal Ambushers.*** Despite their intimidating builds, bugbears move with surprising stealth. They are fond of setting ambushes and flee when outmatched. They are dependable mercenaries as long as they are supplied food, drink, and treasure, but a bugbear forgets any bond when its life is on the line. A wounded member of a bugbear band might be left behind to help the rest of the band escape. Afterward, that bugbear might help pursuers track down its former companions if doing so saves its life.

>- When it makes a melee weapon attack, the bugbear gains a +2 bonus to the damage roll (included in the attack.

## Bugbear Blood Ghost Berserker

These bloodthirsty bugbears paint themselves with gray-white colored dyes to signify that they walk in the afterlife and, thus, do not fear death. They charge howling into combat, driven by their inner rage. Blood ghost berserkers are prized as bodyguards and are often found directly serving goblinoid leaders.

BUGBEAR's TACTICS (read the article)

DESCRIPTION

Bugbears are giant, hairy cousins of goblins who frequent the same areas as their smaller relatives.

Bugbears are large and very muscular, standing 7' tall. Their hides range from light yellow to yellow brown and their thick coarse hair varies in color from brown to brick red. Though vaguely humanoid in appearance, bugbears seem to contain the blood of some large carnivore. Their eyes recall those of some savage bestial animal, being greenish white with red pupils, while their ears are wedge shaped, rising from the top of their heads. A bugbear's mouth is full of long sharp fangs.

Bugbears have a nose much like that of a bear with the same fine sense of smell. It is this feature which earned them their name, despite the fact that they are not actually related to bears in any way. Their tough leathery hide and long sharp nails also look something like those of a bear, but are far more dexterous.

The typical bugbear's sight and hearing are exceptional, and they can move with amazing agility when the need arises. Bugbear eyesight extends somewhat into the infrared, giving them darkvision out to 60 feet.

The bugbear language is a foul sounding mixture of gestures, grunts, and snarls which leads many to underestimate the intelligence of these creatures. In addition, most bugbears can speak the language of goblins and hobgoblins.

HABITAT / SOCIETY

Bugbears prefer to live in caves and in underground locations. A lair may consist of one large cavern or a group of caverns. They are well-adapted to this life, since they operate equally well in daylight and darkness.

Leader

If a lair is uncovered and 12 or more bugbears are encountered they will have a leader. These individuals have 38 hit points (7d8+7), Armor Class of 17 and Strength 17.

Chief

If 24 or more bugbears are encountered, they will have a chief in addition to their leaders. Chiefs have 50 hit points (9d8+9), Armor Class of 18, and Strength 18. Each chief will also have a sub-chief who is identical to the leaders described above.

In a lair, half of the bugbears will be females and young who will not fight except in a life or death situation. If they are forced into combat, the females attack as hobgoblins and the young as kobolds.

The species survives primarily by hunting. They have no compunctions about eating anything they can kill, including humans, goblins, and any monsters smaller than themselves. They are also fond of wine and strong ale, often drinking to excess.

Bugbears are territorial, and the size of the domains vary with the size of the group and its location. It may be several square miles in the wilderness, or a narrow, more restricted area in an underground region.

Intruders are considered a valuable source of food and treasure, and bugbears rarely negotiate. On occasion, they will parley if they think they can gain something exceptional by it. Bugbears sometimes take prisoners to use as slaves.

Extremely greedy, bugbears love glittery, shiny objects and weapons. They are always on the lookout to increase their hoards of coins, gems, and weapons through plunder and ambush.

ECOLOGY

Bugbears have two main goals in life: survival and treasure. They are superb carnivores, winnowing out the weak and careless adventurer, monster and animal. Goblins are always on their toes when bugbears are present, for the weak or stupid quickly end up in the stewpot.

>
>***Surprise Attack.*** If the bugbear surprises a creature and hits it with an attack during the first round of combat, the target takes an extra 7 (2d6) damage from the attack.

>### Actions
>***Sickle.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 7 (2d4 + 2) slashing damage plus 3 (1d6) necrotic damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or the target's speed is halved. In addition, the creature can't take reactions, and it can take either an action or a bonus action on its turn, not both. The effects last until the end of the bugbear's next turn.  
>
>***Innate Spellcasting.*** The bugbear casts one of the following spells using Charisma as the spellcasting ability (spell save DC 14, +6 to hit with spell attacks):

The Cloak of Skiggaret remains for 1 minute, until the bugbear dies, or until the bugbear dismisses it as an action.  
>

The target can make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effects on itself on a success.

## Bugbear Dark Claw of Skiggaret

Skigarret is a hateful bugbear demigod of death, terror, and torture that resembles an 8-foot tall shadowy goblin with lips and hands and feet soaked in blood. The dark claw is an insidious warlock that worships Skiggaret. It can conjure a cloak of tenebrous tendrils around itself that can strike fear to anyone near it. The dark claw can also unleash shadowy claws that rakes and weakens any creature they hit.

Bugbears are born for battle and mayhem. Surviving by raiding and hunting, they bully the weak and despise being bossed around, but their love of carnage means they will fight for powerful masters if bloodshed and treasure are assured.

***Goblinoids.*** Bugbears are often found in the company of their cousins, hobgoblins and goblins. Bugbears usually enslave goblins they encounter, and they bully hobgoblins into giving them gold and food in return for serving as scouts and shock troops. Even when paid, bugbears are at best unreliable allies, yet goblins and hobgoblins understand that no matter how much bugbears might drain a tribe of resources, these creatures are a potent force.

***Followers of Hruggek.*** Bugbears worship Hruggek, a lesser god who dwells on the plane of Acheron. In the absence of their goblinoid kin, bugbears form loose war bands, each one led by its fiercest member. Bugbears believe that when they die, their spirits have a chance to fight at Hruggek's side. They try to prove themselves worthy by defeating as many foes as possible.

***Venal Ambushers.*** Despite their intimidating builds, bugbears move with surprising stealth. They are fond of setting ambushes and flee when outmatched. They are dependable mercenaries as long as they are supplied food, drink, and treasure, but a bugbear forgets any bond when its life is on the line. A wounded member of a bugbear band might be left behind to help the rest of the band escape. Afterward, that bugbear might help pursuers track down its former companions if doing so saves its life.

## Bugbear Dread Eye of Grankhul

The dread eye is a devious and skilled priest-assassin who worships Grankhul, the bugbear deity of hunting, stealth, and surprise. The dread eye serves its tribe as its inquisitor and executioner. It never attacks in the open and rarely without the element of surprise, often taking advantage of its foes' inability to see in the dark. The dread eye specializes in spells and abilities that confuse, disorient, and incapacitate its foes in order to set them up for a quick kill.

BUGBEAR's TACTICS (read the article)

DESCRIPTION

Bugbears are giant, hairy cousins of goblins who frequent the same areas as their smaller relatives.

Bugbears are large and very muscular, standing 7' tall. Their hides range from light yellow to yellow brown and their thick coarse hair varies in color from brown to brick red. Though vaguely humanoid in appearance, bugbears seem to contain the blood of some large carnivore. Their eyes recall those of some savage bestial animal, being greenish white with red pupils, while their ears are wedge shaped, rising from the top of their heads. A bugbear's mouth is full of long sharp fangs.

Bugbears have a nose much like that of a bear with the same fine sense of smell. It is this feature which earned them their name, despite the fact that they are not actually related to bears in any way. Their tough leathery hide and long sharp nails also look something like those of a bear, but are far more dexterous.

The typical bugbear's sight and hearing are exceptional, and they can move with amazing agility when the need arises. Bugbear eyesight extends somewhat into the infrared, giving them darkvision out to 60 feet.

The bugbear language is a foul sounding mixture of gestures, grunts, and snarls which leads many to underestimate the intelligence of these creatures. In addition, most bugbears can speak the language of goblins and hobgoblins.

HABITAT / SOCIETY

Bugbears prefer to live in caves and in underground locations. A lair may consist of one large cavern or a group of caverns. They are well-adapted to this life, since they operate equally well in daylight and darkness.

Leader

If a lair is uncovered and 12 or more bugbears are encountered they will have a leader. These individuals have 38 hit points (7d8+7), Armor Class of 17 and Strength 17.

Chief

If 24 or more bugbears are encountered, they will have a chief in addition to their leaders. Chiefs have 50 hit points (9d8+9), Armor Class of 18, and Strength 18. Each chief will also have a sub-chief who is identical to the leaders described above.

In a lair, half of the bugbears will be females and young who will not fight except in a life or death situation. If they are forced into combat, the females attack as hobgoblins and the young as kobolds.

The species survives primarily by hunting. They have no compunctions about eating anything they can kill, including humans, goblins, and any monsters smaller than themselves. They are also fond of wine and strong ale, often drinking to excess.

Bugbears are territorial, and the size of the domains vary with the size of the group and its location. It may be several square miles in the wilderness, or a narrow, more restricted area in an underground region.

Intruders are considered a valuable source of food and treasure, and bugbears rarely negotiate. On occasion, they will parley if they think they can gain something exceptional by it. Bugbears sometimes take prisoners to use as slaves.

Extremely greedy, bugbears love glittery, shiny objects and weapons. They are always on the lookout to increase their hoards of coins, gems, and weapons through plunder and ambush.

ECOLOGY

Bugbears have two main goals in life: survival and treasure. They are superb carnivores, winnowing out the weak and careless adventurer, monster and animal. Goblins are always on their toes when bugbears are present, for the weak or stupid quickly end up in the stewpot.

The creature can add a d4 to its roll provided it can hear and understand the bugbear. A creature can benefit from only one Leadership die at a time. This effect ends if the bugbear is incapacitated.

## Bugbear Warchief

Bugbears are born for battle and mayhem. Surviving by raiding and hunting, they bully the weak and despise being bossed around, but their love of carnage means they will fight for powerful masters if bloodshed and treasure are assured.

***Goblinoids.*** Bugbears are often found in the company of their cousins, hobgoblins and goblins. Bugbears usually enslave goblins they encounter, and they bully hobgoblins into giving them gold and food in return for serving as scouts and shock troops. Even when paid, bugbears are at best unreliable allies, yet goblins and hobgoblins understand that no matter how much bugbears might drain a tribe of resources, these creatures are a potent force.

***Followers of Hruggek.*** Bugbears worship Hruggek, a lesser god who dwells on the plane of Acheron. In the absence of their goblinoid kin, bugbears form loose war bands, each one led by its fiercest member. Bugbears believe that when they die, their spirits have a chance to fight at Hruggek's side. They try to prove themselves worthy by defeating as many foes as possible.

***Venal Ambushers.*** Despite their intimidating builds, bugbears move with surprising stealth. They are fond of setting ambushes and flee when outmatched. They are dependable mercenaries as long as they are supplied food, drink, and treasure, but a bugbear forgets any bond when its life is on the line. A wounded member of a bugbear band might be left behind to help the rest of the band escape. Afterward, that bugbear might help pursuers track down its former companions if doing so saves its life.

## Bugbear Warlock

These bugbears are warlocks of the fiend and are able to cast devastating spells. They counsel their chieftains and leaders in subjects about the arcane, supernatural, and worship of demons.

## Bugbear Witch Doctor

The bugbear witch doctor mainly serves its tribe as its spiritual guide and healer. It is still a dangerous foe in combat because of its ability to charm, confuse, incapacitate, and curse its foes with its spells and abilities.

## Chaos-spawn Goblin

*This stunted creature, wrapped almost entirely in the remnants of a cloak, has the face of an emaciated goblin. Its tiny hole of a mouth looks incapable of speech, and its glazed eyes stare at nothing.*

***Warped by the Unknowable.*** These creatures were once goblins, still retaining their general size and form, but long exposure to the psyche-obliterating presence of Great Old Ones has warped them in a variety of ways. They no longer speak aloud but communicate telepathically in images. Chaos-spawn goblins no longer eat as they once did, receiving all of their sustenance from the star-born creatures they now serve.

***Single-minded Servants.*** Raiding and taking captives still occupies much of the chaos-spawn's time, but now their captives are placed inside organic pods or orifices of various kinds which grow in the ground below their masters' feet in web-like structures. There, the Great Old Ones drain whatever it is they wish from the captives, who leave nothing but a gel-like substance behind. This substance is what sustains the chaosspawn goblins, which they take in through feeding tubes.

***Loyal Servants.*** In their hunts for captives, they do not hesitate to prey on goblins. For this reason, and out of sheer terror, other goblins avoid the chaos-spawn as much as they are able. Indeed, the areas chaos-spawn inhabit are often barren of other intelligent life.

## Dermot Wurder (Tier 1)

When you're the twelfth son of a poor goblin family in Jigow, the only way to make a name for yourself is to become a great champion—someone who can win bragging contests in the local taverns night after night. Young Dermot Wurder, however, wasn't interested in performing feats of strength or agility that would win him a boast-worthy epithet. Fame wasn't for him, nor was the aggressiveness that becoming famous required. He was more interested in cooking, planting flowers, and sewing clothes—doing the work that kept his family together while his carefree siblings dove off waterfalls and wrestled stray dogs.

Dermot and Ayo Jabe have known each other long enough that their first meeting has vanished into the haze of youthful pre-memory. Dermot accompanied Ayo whenever he could, packing herbs and medicines when they went exploring in the woods. When Ayo recently told him of her dream to form an adventuring party, he started training to wear heavy armor and threw himself into studying the faith of the Luxon so he could wield the blessings of the light to protect those he cares about.

Dermot is fiercely protective of his friends and furiously rebukes anyone who disparages or threatens them. His deepest need—one even he doesn't know he has—is to make a friend who will help him realize what he wants for himself.

## Dermot Wurder (Tier 2)

When you're the twelfth son of a poor goblin family in Jigow, the only way to make a name for yourself is to become a great champion—someone who can win bragging contests in the local taverns night after night. Young Dermot Wurder, however, wasn't interested in performing feats of strength or agility that would win him a boast-worthy epithet. Fame wasn't for him, nor was the aggressiveness that becoming famous required. He was more interested in cooking, planting flowers, and sewing clothes—doing the work that kept his family together while his carefree siblings dove off waterfalls and wrestled stray dogs.

Dermot and Ayo Jabe have known each other long enough that their first meeting has vanished into the haze of youthful pre-memory. Dermot accompanied Ayo whenever he could, packing herbs and medicines when they went exploring in the woods. When Ayo recently told him of her dream to form an adventuring party, he started training to wear heavy armor and threw himself into studying the faith of the Luxon so he could wield the blessings of the light to protect those he cares about.

Dermot is fiercely protective of his friends and furiously rebukes anyone who disparages or threatens them. His deepest need—one even he doesn't know he has—is to make a friend who will help him realize what he wants for himself.

Their journey has forced the tier 3 rivals to make decisions, sometimes out of grim necessity, that they might have not made earlier. All five suffer from ruidium corruption (see "Ruidium "in the introduction). When the characters encounter them, assume that the rivals have removed all levels of exhaustion from themselves through rest or magic, but the other effects of ruidium corruption remain.

If instead you want to weaken the rivals to make them less of a physical threat or reinforce the danger of ruidium corruption, you can give one or more of the rivals 1d4 levels of exhaustion each. In this case, you'll need to keep track of each rival's exhaustion level and the condition's corresponding effects (see "Exhaustion "in the*Player's Handbook*).

***Useful Magic.*** To facilitate their efforts, Galsariad has learned the water breathing spell. Additionally, all the rivals have acquired ruidium equipment to protect them from the effects of underwater pressure.

## Durnn

War horns sound, stones fly from catapults, and the thunder of a thousand booted feet echoes across the land as hobgoblins march to battle. Across the borderlands of civilization, settlements and settlers must contend with these aggressive humanoids, whose thirst for conquest is never satisfied.

Hobgoblins have dark orange or red-orange skin, and hair ranging from dark red-brown to dark gray. Yellow or dark brown eyes peer out beneath their beetling brows, and their wide mouths sport sharp and yellowed teeth. A male hobgoblin might have a large blue or red nose, which symbolizes virility and power among goblinkin. Hobgoblins can live as long as humans, though their love of warfare and battle means that few do.

***Goblinoids.*** Hobgoblins belong to a family of creatures called goblinoids. They are often found lording over their cousins, the smaller goblins and the ferocious bugbears.

***Martial Might.*** A hobgoblin measures virtue by physical strength and martial prowess, caring about nothing except the opportunity to demonstrate skill and cunning in battle. Hobgoblins of high military rank attain their positions by force, then hold those positions by imposing their authority through draconian measures.

Hobgoblins train to fight with a variety of weapons, and have great skill at crafting arms, armor, siege engines, and other military devices. Organized and disciplined, they take exceptional care of their weapons, armor, and personal possessions. They favor the bold colors associated with their tribes, and trim their often-elaborate uniforms with blood-red piping and leather dyed black.

***Military Legions.*** Hobgoblins organize themselves into tribal bands known as legions. In their martial society, every hobgoblin has a rank, from the powerful leaders and champions, to the rank-and-file foot soldiers, to the goblins that find themselves driven into the front lines at spear point. A legion is headed by a warlord with several captains serving under its command. A hobgoblin warlord is a ruthless tyrant more interested in strategy, victory, glory, reputation, and dominion than leading troops into battle.

As loyal and disciplined as hobgoblins are in their own legion, rival legions compete constantly for reputation and status. Meetings between legions erupt in violence if troops aren't restrained, and only exceptionally powerful leaders can force legions to cooperate on the battlefield.

***Strategic Thinkers.*** Hobgoblins have a strong grasp of tactics and discipline, and can carry out sophisticated battle plans under the direction of a strategically minded leader. However, they hate elves and attack them first in battle over any other opponents, even if doing so would be a tactical error.

Legions often supplement their ranks with less reliable and more expendable troops, including goblins, bugbears, orcs, evil humans, ogres, and giants.

***Beast Trainers.*** Hobgoblins have a long history of training animals to service. Like the more civilized races, they use oxen and horses to transport goods and weaponry over long distances. They communicate with each other using trained ravens, and keep vicious wolves to guard prisoners and protect hobgoblin camps. Hobgoblin cavalry use trained worgs as steeds, in the same way that goblins ride wolves. Some tribes even keep carnivorous apes as fighting beasts.

***Conquer and Control.*** Hobgoblins claim lands with abundant resources, and they can be found in forests and mountains, near mines and humanoid settlements, and anywhere else that wood, metal, and potential slaves can be found. They build and conquer strongholds in strategically advantageous locations, which they then use as staging areas to expand their territory.

Hobgoblin warlords never tire of combat, but they don't take up arms lightly. Before they attack, hobgoblins conduct thorough reconnaissance to gauge the strengths and weaknesses of their foes. When assaulting a stronghold, they surround it first to cut off escape routes and supply lines, then slowly starve their enemies out.

Hobgoblins fortify their own holdings, bolstering existing defenses with innovations of their own. Whether they lair in cavern complexes, dungeons, ruins, or forests, they protect their strongholds with ditches, fences, gates, guard towers, pit traps, and crude catapults or ballistas.

***Legion of Maglubiyet.*** Hobgoblins worship Maglubiyet the Mighty One, the greater god of goblinoids. As terrifying as this figure is, hobgoblins don't fear death, believing that when they die in battle, their spirits join the honored ranks of Maglubiyet's army on the plane of Acheron.

## Dust Goblin

*A ragged creature emerges from the sand. Its spindly frame is encased in a hodge.podge of armor scraps and rusted weapons. A long, hooked nose protrudes over a wide mouth filled with sharp teeth.*

Dust goblins vary greatly in size and appearance, although they are universally scrawny, bony, and lanky. They seem to suffer from malnutrition even when in perfect health, a perception reinforced by the way their bellies distend after they've gorged themselves on flesh. Their skin is always dry and cracked, ranging from dusky gray to dark green in color.

***Rule the Wastelands.*** Dust goblins are twisted creatures, tainted by many generations of life in a blasted wasteland. After a magical war devastated the dust goblins' homeland, they rose to become the most dominant inhabitants. They inhabit ancient ruins and ambush travelers who stray too close to their borders.

***Twisted Minds.*** The lingering magical energy saturating the wastes of their home, coupled with the harsh conditions in which they scratch out a living, have tainted the minds of all dust goblins. Their thinking is alien and unfathomable to most creatures. Whereas most goblins are cowardly, dust goblins don't seem to experience fear. To the contrary, they enjoy wearing skull helmets and using ghostly whistles to frighten foes.

Owing to this alien mindset, dust goblins get along disturbingly well with aberrations. The creatures often forge alliances and work together for mutual benefit, while making their unnerving mark on communal lairs.

Dust goblins range from 2 to 4 feet tall, and weigh between 20 and 80 pounds.

>
>### Reactions
>***Parry.*** The dust goblin chieftain adds 2 to its AC against one melee attack that would hit it. To do so, the chieftain must see the attacker and be wielding a melee weapon.

## Dust Goblin Chieftain

*At first, the strange eyes and gibbering might make the dust goblin seem addled or at least a less-than-formidable foe. But its mastery of command words and bizarre ancient rituals makes these small creatures extremely dangerous, able to call on powers older than human history.*

A dust goblin chieftain must keep its tribe alive and fed, which is no small accomplishment in the wastelands it calls home. The chieftain has an edge on its fellows, which helps it keep the others in line, and that edge takes the form of a beneficial mutation brought on by the energies which permeate its homelands.

***Mastery of Ancient Languages.*** Dust goblin chieftains are often surprisingly learned in ancient tongues, able to speak and command creatures of the outer void, the hells, or from tombs long forgotten. Their ability to decipher scripts and faded text is unmatched.

***Strange Technology and Oddly Arcane Items.*** Thanks to the ruined civilizations which came before and in whose ruins the dust goblins live, a chieftain has access to a wide variety of unexpected items and magic. The exact nature of these items varies from chieftain to chieftain and is up to the GM's discretion.

## Goblin

Goblins are small, black-hearted, selfish humanoids that lair in caves, abandoned mines, despoiled dungeons, and other dismal settings. Individually weak, goblins gather in large-sometimes overwhelming-numbers. They crave power and regularly abuse whatever authority they obtain.

***Goblinoids.*** Goblins belong to a family of creatures called goblinoids. Their larger cousins, hobgoblins and bugbears, like to bully goblins into submission. Goblins are lazy and undisciplined, making them poor servants, laborers, and guards.

***Malicious Glee.*** Motivated by greed and malice, goblins can't help but celebrate the few times they have the upper hand. They dance, caper with sheer joy when victory is theirs. Once their revels have ended, goblins delight in the torment of other creatures and embrace all manner of wickedness.

***Leaders and Followers.*** Goblins are ruled by the strongest or smartest among them. A goblin boss might command a single lair, while a goblin king or queen (who is nothing more than a glorified goblin boss) rules hundreds of goblins, spread out among multiple lairs to ensure the tribe's survival. Goblin bosses are easily ousted, and many goblin tribes are taken over by hobgoblin warlords or bugbear chiefs.

***Challenging Lairs.*** Goblins festoon their lairs with alarms designed to signal the arrival of intruders. Those lairs are also riddled with narrow tunnels and bolt-holes that human-sized creatures can't navigate, but which goblins can crawl through with ease, allowing them to flee or to circle around and surprise their enemies. Rat Keepers and Wolf Riders. Goblins have an affinity for rats and wolves, raising them to serve as companions and mounts, respectively. Like rats, goblins shun sunlight and sleep underground during the day. Like wolves, they are pack hunters, made bolder by their numbers. When they hunt from the backs of wolves, goblins use hit-and-run attacks.

***Worshipers of Maglubiyet.*** Maglubiyet the Mighty One, the Lord of Depths and Darkness, is the greater god of goblinoids. Envisioned by most goblins as an eleven-foot-tall battle-scarred goblin with black skin and fire erupting from his eyes, he is worshiped not out of adoration but fear. Goblins believe that when they die in battle, their spirits join the ranks of Maglubiyet's army on the plane of Acheron. This is a "privilege" that most goblins dread, fearing the Mighty One's eternal tyranny even more than death.

[https://angrygolem-games.com/monster-tactics-fight-like-a-goblin/](GOBLIN's TACTICS (read the article))

DESCRIPTION

These small, evil humanoids would be merely pests, if not for their great numbers. Goblins have flat faces, broad noses, pointed ears, wide mouths and small, sharp fangs. Their foreheads slope back, and their eyes are usually dull and glazed.

They always walk upright, but their arms hang down almost to their knees. Their skin colors range from yellow through any shade of orange to a deep red. Usually a single tribe has members all of about the same color skin.

Their eyes vary from bright red to a gleaming lemon yellow. They wear clothing of dark leather, tending toward dull soiled-looking colors. Goblin speech is harsh, and pitched higher than that of humans.

In addition to their own language, some goblins can speak in the kobold, orc, and hobgoblin tongues.

HABITAT / SOCIETY

Humans would consider the caves and underground dwellings of goblins to be dank and dismal. Those few tribes that live above ground are found in ruins, and are only

active at night or on very dark, cloudy days. They use no form of sanitation, and their lairs have a foul stench. Goblins seem to be somewhat resistant to the diseases that breed in such filth.

They live a communal life, sharing large common areas for eating and sleeping. Only leaders have separate living spaces. All their possessions are carried with them. Property of the tribe is kept with the chief and sub-chiefs. Most of their goods are stolen, although they do manufacture their own garments and leather goods.

The concept of privacy is largely foreign to goblins. A typical goblin tribe has 4d10 x 10 adult male warriors. For every 40 goblins there will be a leader and his 4 assistants, each having 3 Hit Die.

For every 200 goblins there will be a sub-chief and 2d4 bodyguards, each of which has 4 Hit Dice, is Armor Class 16, and armed with a battle axe. The tribe has a single goblin chief and 2d4 bodyguards each of 5 Hit Dice, Armor Class 17, and armed with two weapons.

There is a 25% chance that 10% of their force will be mounted upon huge worgs, and have another 1d4x10 unmounted worgs with them. There is a 60% chance that the lair is guarded by 5d6 such wolves, and a 20% chance of 2d6 bugbears. Goblin shamans (clerics) are rare, but have been known to reach 7th level.

In addition to the males, there will be adult females equal to 60% of their number and children equal to the total number of adults in the lair. Neither will fight in battles.

A goblin tribe has an exact pecking order; each member knows who is above him and who is below him. They fight amongst themselves constantly to move up this social ladder.

They often take slaves for both food and labor. The tribe will have slaves of several races numbering 10-40% of the size of the tribe. Slaves are always kept shackled, and are staked to a common chain when sleeping.

Goblins hate most other humanoids, gnomes and dwarves in particular, and work to exterminate them whenever possible.

ECOLOGY

Goblins live only 50 years or so. They do not need to eat much, but will kill just for the pleasure of it. They eat any creature from rats and snakes to humans. In lean times they will eat carrion.

Goblins usually spoil their habitat, driving game from it and depleting the area of all resources. They are decent miners, able to note new or unusual construction in an underground area, and any habitat will soon be expanded by a maze-like network of tunnels.

## Goblin Boss

Goblins are small, black-hearted, selfish humanoids that lair in caves, abandoned mines, despoiled dungeons, and other dismal settings. Individually weak, goblins gather in large-sometimes overwhelming-numbers. They crave power and regularly abuse whatever authority they obtain.

***Goblinoids.*** Goblins belong to a family of creatures called goblinoids. Their larger cousins, hobgoblins and bugbears, like to bully goblins into submission. Goblins are lazy and undisciplined, making them poor servants, laborers, and guards.

***Malicious Glee.*** Motivated by greed and malice, goblins can't help but celebrate the few times they have the upper hand. They dance, caper with sheer joy when victory is theirs. Once their revels have ended, goblins delight in the torment of other creatures and embrace all manner of wickedness.

***Leaders and Followers.*** Goblins are ruled by the strongest or smartest among them. A goblin boss might command a single lair, while a goblin king or queen (who is nothing more than a glorified goblin boss) rules hundreds of goblins, spread out among multiple lairs to ensure the tribe's survival. Goblin bosses are easily ousted, and many goblin tribes are taken over by hobgoblin warlords or bugbear chiefs.

***Challenging Lairs.*** Goblins festoon their lairs with alarms designed to signal the arrival of intruders. Those lairs are also riddled with narrow tunnels and bolt-holes that human-sized creatures can't navigate, but which goblins can crawl through with ease, allowing them to flee or to circle around and surprise their enemies. Rat Keepers and Wolf Riders. Goblins have an affinity for rats and wolves, raising them to serve as companions and mounts, respectively. Like rats, goblins shun sunlight and sleep underground during the day. Like wolves, they are pack hunters, made bolder by their numbers. When they hunt from the backs of wolves, goblins use hit-and-run attacks.

***Worshipers of Maglubiyet.*** Maglubiyet the Mighty One, the Lord of Depths and Darkness, is the greater god of goblinoids. Envisioned by most goblins as an eleven-foot-tall battle-scarred goblin with black skin and fire erupting from his eyes, he is worshiped not out of adoration but fear. Goblins believe that when they die in battle, their spirits join the ranks of Maglubiyet's army on the plane of Acheron. This is a "privilege" that most goblins dread, fearing the Mighty One's eternal tyranny even more than death.

DESCRIPTION

These small, evil humanoids would be merely pests, if not for their great numbers.

Goblins have flat faces, broad noses, pointed ears, wide mouths and small, sharp fangs. Their foreheads slope back, and their eyes are usually dull and glazed.

They always walk upright, but their arms hang down almost to their knees. Their skin colors range from yellow through any shade of orange to a deep red. Usually a single tribe has members all of about the same color skin.

Their eyes vary from bright red to a gleaming lemon yellow. They wear clothing of dark leather, tending toward dull soiled-looking colors. Goblin speech is harsh, and pitched higher than that of humans.

In addition to their own language, some goblins can speak in the kobold, orc, and hobgoblin tongues.

HABITAT / SOCIETY

Humans would consider the caves and underground dwellings of goblins to be dank and dismal. Those few tribes that live above ground are found in ruins, and are only

active at night or on very dark, cloudy days. They use no form of sanitation, and their lairs have a foul stench. Goblins seem to be somewhat resistant to the diseases that breed in such filth.

They live a communal life, sharing large common areas for eating and sleeping. Only leaders have separate living spaces. All their possessions are carried with them. Property of the tribe is kept with the chief and sub-chiefs. Most of their goods are stolen, although they do manufacture their own garments and leather goods.

The concept of privacy is largely foreign to goblins. A typical goblin tribe has 4d10 x 10 adult male warriors. For every 40 goblins there will be a leader and his 4 assistants, each having 3 Hit Die.

For every 200 goblins there will be a sub-chief and 2d4 bodyguards, each of which has 4 Hit Dice, is Armor Class 16, and armed with a battle axe. The tribe has a single goblin chief and 2d4 bodyguards each of 5 Hit Dice, Armor Class 17, and armed with two weapons.

There is a 25% chance that 10% of their force will be mounted upon huge worgs, and have another 1d4x10 unmounted worgs with them. There is a 60% chance that the lair is guarded by 5d6 such wolves, and a 20% chance of 2d6 bugbears. Goblin shamans (clerics) are rare, but have been known to reach 7th level.

In addition to the males, there will be adult females equal to 60% of their number and children equal to the total number of adults in the lair. Neither will fight in battles.

A goblin tribe has an exact pecking order; each member knows who is above him and who is below him. They fight amongst themselves constantly to move up this social ladder.

They often take slaves for both food and labor. The tribe will have slaves of several races numbering 10-40% of the size of the tribe. Slaves are always kept shackled, and are staked to a common chain when sleeping.

Goblins hate most other humanoids, gnomes and dwarves in particular, and work to exterminate them whenever possible.

ECOLOGY

Goblins live only 50 years or so. They do not need to eat much, but will kill just for the pleasure of it. They eat any creature from rats and snakes to humans. In lean times they will eat carrion.

Goblins usually spoil their habitat, driving game from it and depleting the area of all resources. They are decent miners, able to note new or unusual construction in an underground area, and any habitat will soon be expanded by a maze-like network of tunnels.

## Goblin Ganglord

The ruthless ganglord rules its underlings through fear and often commits violent acts to keep its minions in line to remind them not to betray, fail, or challenge it. The ganglord will mercilessly torture victims in front of its top goblinoid lieutenants to intimidate them and spread fear.

The ganglord operates within close vicinity of a civilized humanoid settlement, often basing its activities in a nearby cavern, ruins, sewer system, or underground complex. It relies on intimidation, thuggery, murder, and mischief to earn.

## Goblin Peacemaker of Bargrivyek

Bargrivyek is the goblin deity of cooperation and unity between goblinoid races. His favored high priests are known as Peacemakers, goblin warrior priests who encouraged teamwork between goblins, hobgoblins, and bugbears. In reality, they function more as pacifiers and resolvers of conflict between the goblinoid races. They are successful not because of their diplomatic abilities but because the other goblinoids, especially the bugbears, fear them more.

In combat, the peacemakers utilize their divine spells to control and dominate their enemies. In addition, they can paralyze a foe with a single strike of their flails.

## Grenl

Goblins are small, black-hearted, selfish humanoids that lair in caves, abandoned mines, despoiled dungeons, and other dismal settings. Individually weak, goblins gather in large-sometimes overwhelming-numbers. They crave power and regularly abuse whatever authority they obtain.

***Goblinoids.*** Goblins belong to a family of creatures called goblinoids. Their larger cousins, hobgoblins and bugbears, like to bully goblins into submission. Goblins are lazy and undisciplined, making them poor servants, laborers, and guards.

***Malicious Glee.*** Motivated by greed and malice, goblins can't help but celebrate the few times they have the upper hand. They dance, caper with sheer joy when victory is theirs. Once their revels have ended, goblins delight in the torment of other creatures and embrace all manner of wickedness.

***Leaders and Followers.*** Goblins are ruled by the strongest or smartest among them. A goblin boss might command a single lair, while a goblin king or queen (who is nothing more than a glorified goblin boss) rules hundreds of goblins, spread out among multiple lairs to ensure the tribe's survival. Goblin bosses are easily ousted, and many goblin tribes are taken over by hobgoblin warlords or bugbear chiefs.

***Challenging Lairs.*** Goblins festoon their lairs with alarms designed to signal the arrival of intruders. Those lairs are also riddled with narrow tunnels and bolt-holes that human-sized creatures can't navigate, but which goblins can crawl through with ease, allowing them to flee or to circle around and surprise their enemies. Rat Keepers and Wolf Riders. Goblins have an affinity for rats and wolves, raising them to serve as companions and mounts, respectively. Like rats, goblins shun sunlight and sleep underground during the day. Like wolves, they are pack hunters, made bolder by their numbers. When they hunt from the backs of wolves, goblins use hit-and-run attacks.

***Worshipers of Maglubiyet.*** Maglubiyet the Mighty One, the Lord of Depths and Darkness, is the greater god of goblinoids. Envisioned by most goblins as an eleven-foot-tall battle-scarred goblin with black skin and fire erupting from his eyes, he is worshiped not out of adoration but fear. Goblins believe that when they die in battle, their spirits join the ranks of Maglubiyet's army on the plane of Acheron. This is a "privilege" that most goblins dread, fearing the Mighty One's eternal tyranny even more than death.

## Hobgoblin

War horns sound, stones fly from catapults, and the thunder of a thousand booted feet echoes across the land as hobgoblins march to battle. Across the borderlands of civilization, settlements and settlers must contend with these aggressive humanoids, whose thirst for conquest is never satisfied.

Hobgoblins have dark orange or red-orange skin, and hair ranging from dark red-brown to dark gray. Yellow or dark brown eyes peer out beneath their beetling brows, and their wide mouths sport sharp and yellowed teeth. A male hobgoblin might have a large blue or red nose, which symbolizes virility and power among goblinkin. Hobgoblins can live as long as humans, though their love of warfare and battle means that few do.

***Goblinoids.*** Hobgoblins belong to a family of creatures called goblinoids. They are often found lording over their cousins, the smaller goblins and the ferocious bugbears.

***Martial Might.*** A hobgoblin measures virtue by physical strength and martial prowess, caring about nothing except the opportunity to demonstrate skill and cunning in battle. Hobgoblins of high military rank attain their positions by force, then hold those positions by imposing their authority through draconian measures.

Hobgoblins train to fight with a variety of weapons, and have great skill at crafting arms, armor, siege engines, and other military devices. Organized and disciplined, they take exceptional care of their weapons, armor, and personal possessions. They favor the bold colors associated with their tribes, and trim their often-elaborate uniforms with blood-red piping and leather dyed black.

***Military Legions.*** Hobgoblins organize themselves into tribal bands known as legions. In their martial society, every hobgoblin has a rank, from the powerful leaders and champions, to the rank-and-file foot soldiers, to the goblins that find themselves driven into the front lines at spear point. A legion is headed by a warlord with several captains serving under its command. A hobgoblin warlord is a ruthless tyrant more interested in strategy, victory, glory, reputation, and dominion than leading troops into battle.

As loyal and disciplined as hobgoblins are in their own legion, rival legions compete constantly for reputation and status. Meetings between legions erupt in violence if troops aren't restrained, and only exceptionally powerful leaders can force legions to cooperate on the battlefield.

***Strategic Thinkers.*** Hobgoblins have a strong grasp of tactics and discipline, and can carry out sophisticated battle plans under the direction of a strategically minded leader. However, they hate elves and attack them first in battle over any other opponents, even if doing so would be a tactical error.

Legions often supplement their ranks with less reliable and more expendable troops, including goblins, bugbears, orcs, evil humans, ogres, and giants.

***Beast Trainers.*** Hobgoblins have a long history of training animals to service. Like the more civilized races, they use oxen and horses to transport goods and weaponry over long distances. They communicate with each other using trained ravens, and keep vicious wolves to guard prisoners and protect hobgoblin camps. Hobgoblin cavalry use trained worgs as steeds, in the same way that goblins ride wolves. Some tribes even keep carnivorous apes as fighting beasts.

***Conquer and Control.*** Hobgoblins claim lands with abundant resources, and they can be found in forests and mountains, near mines and humanoid settlements, and anywhere else that wood, metal, and potential slaves can be found. They build and conquer strongholds in strategically advantageous locations, which they then use as staging areas to expand their territory.

Hobgoblin warlords never tire of combat, but they don't take up arms lightly. Before they attack, hobgoblins conduct thorough reconnaissance to gauge the strengths and weaknesses of their foes. When assaulting a stronghold, they surround it first to cut off escape routes and supply lines, then slowly starve their enemies out.

Hobgoblins fortify their own holdings, bolstering existing defenses with innovations of their own. Whether they lair in cavern complexes, dungeons, ruins, or forests, they protect their strongholds with ditches, fences, gates, guard towers, pit traps, and crude catapults or ballistas.

***Legion of Maglubiyet.*** Hobgoblins worship Maglubiyet the Mighty One, the greater god of goblinoids. As terrifying as this figure is, hobgoblins don't fear death, believing that when they die in battle, their spirits join the honored ranks of Maglubiyet's army on the plane of Acheron.

DESCRIPTION

Hobgoblins are a fierce humanoid race that wage a perpetual war with the other humanoid races. They are intelligent, organized, and aggressive. The typical hobgoblin is a burly humanoid standing 6 feet tall.

Their hairy hides range from dark reddish-brown to dark gray. Their faces show dark red or red-orange skin. Large males have blue or red noses. Hobgoblin eyes are either yellowish or dark brown while their teeth are yellow. Their garments tend to be brightly colored, often bold, blood red.

Any leather is always tinted black. Hobgoblin weaponry is kept polished and repaired. Hobgoblins have their own language and often speak with orcs, goblins, and carnivorous apes. Roughly 20% of them can speak the common tongue of man.

HABITAT / SOCIETY

Hobgoblins are nightmarish mockeries of the humanoid races who have a military society organized in tribal bands. Each tribe is intensely jealous of its status. Chance meetings with other tribes will result in verbal abuse or open fighting. Hobgoblin tribes are found in almost any climate or subterranean realm.

Hobgoblins usually organize in tribes. However, during wartime or important military campaigns, the tribes unite to form a legion.

A typical tribe of hobgoblins will have 2d100 adult male warriors.

- For every 20 male hobgoblins there will be 1 hobgoblin sergeant + 2 hobgoblin assistants with 20 hit points each.

- Groups numbering over 100 are led by a **hobgoblin sub-chief**.

- If the hobgoblins are encountered in their lair, they will be led by a **hobgoblin chief**. The chief has 5d4 hobgoblin sub-chiefs acting as bodyguards.

If the hobgoblins are encountered in a legion, there will be 10d100 of them, led by a **hobgoblin captain** or a **hobgoblin warlord** if the legion numbers more than 5,000 soldiers.

Each tribe has a distinctive battle standard which is carried into combat to inspire the troops. If the tribal chief is leading the battle, he will carry the standard with him, otherwise it will be held by one of his sub-chiefs.

In addition to the warriors present in a hobgoblin tribe, there will be half again that many females and three times as many children as adult males.

Fully 80% of all known hobgoblin lairs are subterranean complexes. The remaining 20% are surface villages which are fortified with a ditch, fence, at least two gates, and 1d4+2 guard towers. Villages are often built upon ruined humanoid settlements and may incorporate defensive features already present in the ruins.

Hobgoblin villages possess artillery in the form of 2 heavy catapults, 2 light catapults, and 1 ballista for each 50 warriors.

ECOLOGY

Hobgoblins feel superior to goblins or orcs and may act as leaders for them. In such cases, the "lesser races" are used as battle fodder. Hobgoblin mercenaries may work for powerful or rich evil humanoids.

## Hobgoblin Annihilator

When a hobgoblin devastator demonstrates skill and more than just a natural affinity to evocation magic, it attracts the attention of the magistrates from the Academy of Devastation. Such a gifted individual is plucked from its ranks and is forced to undergo an advanced and more dangerous level of arcane training, exposing them to higher forms of evocation magic. Those that survive the deadly process eventually become annihilators.

DESCRIPTION

Hobgoblins are a fierce humanoid race that wage a perpetual war with the other humanoid races. They are intelligent, organized, and aggressive. The typical hobgoblin is a burly humanoid standing 6 feet tall.

Their hairy hides range from dark reddish-brown to dark gray. Their faces show dark red or red-orange skin. Large males have blue or red noses. Hobgoblin eyes are either yellowish or dark brown while their teeth are yellow. Their garments tend to be brightly colored, often bold, blood red.

Any leather is always tinted black. Hobgoblin weaponry is kept polished and repaired. Hobgoblins have their own language and often speak with orcs, goblins, and carnivorous apes. Roughly 20% of them can speak the common tongue of man.

HABITAT / SOCIETY

Hobgoblins are nightmarish mockeries of the humanoid races who have a military society organized in tribal bands. Each tribe is intensely jealous of its status. Chance meetings with other tribes will result in verbal abuse or open fighting. Hobgoblin tribes are found in almost any climate or subterranean realm.

Hobgoblins usually organize in tribes. However, during wartime or important military campaigns, the tribes unite to form a legion.

A typical tribe of hobgoblins will have 2d100 adult male warriors.

- For every 20 male hobgoblins there will be 1 hobgoblin sergeant + 2 hobgoblin assistants with 20 hit points each.

- Groups numbering over 100 are led by a **hobgoblin sub-chief**.

- If the hobgoblins are encountered in their lair, they will be led by a **hobgoblin chief**. The chief has 5d4 hobgoblin sub-chiefs acting as bodyguards.

If the hobgoblins are encountered in a legion, there will be 10d100 of them, led by a **hobgoblin captain** or a **hobgoblin warlord** if the legion numbers more than 5,000 soldiers.

Each tribe has a distinctive battle standard which is carried into combat to inspire the troops. If the tribal chief is leading the battle, he will carry the standard with him, otherwise it will be held by one of his sub-chiefs.

In addition to the warriors present in a hobgoblin tribe, there will be half again that many females and three times as many children as adult males.

Fully 80% of all known hobgoblin lairs are subterranean complexes. The remaining 20% are surface villages which are fortified with a ditch, fence, at least two gates, and 1d4+2 guard towers. Villages are often built upon ruined humanoid settlements and may incorporate defensive features already present in the ruins.

Hobgoblin villages possess artillery in the form of 2 heavy catapults, 2 light catapults, and 1 ballista for each 50 warriors.

ECOLOGY

Hobgoblins feel superior to goblins or orcs and may act as leaders for them. In such cases, the "lesser races" are used as battle fodder. Hobgoblin mercenaries may work for powerful or rich evil humanoids.

## Hobgoblin Devastator

In hobgoblin society, the Academy of Devastation identifies hobgoblins with a talent for magic and puts them through a grueling training regimen that endows them with the ability to call down fireballs and other destructive magic on the host's behalf. A hobgoblin devastator on the battlefield is simultaneously a boon to all its allies and a threat to every foe around it.

***Into the Fray.***  While other cultures treat their wizards as cloistered academics, hobgoblins expect their spellcasters to fight. Devastators learn the basics of weapon use, and they measure their deeds by the enemies defeated though their magic.

Devastators have the respect of other members of the host, and they receive obedience and deference from many quarters. Their ability to lay waste to entire formations with a single use of magic allows them to gain far more glory in battle than a single warrior.

Other cultures might view the use of such abilities as a short cut to glory, but to hobgoblins a gift for magic is as valued and useful as a strong sword arm or brilliance in tactics. They are all boons from Maglubiyet that must be cultivated and unleashed upon the enemy.

The Academy of Devastation believes that an academic approach to magic is a sign of weakness and inefficiency. A warrior doesn't need to know about metallurgy to wield a blade, so why should a wizard care about where magic comes from? Devastators love to prove their superiority in battle by seeking out enemy spellcasters and destroying them.

***Only Results Matter.***  Devastators study a simplified form of evocation magic. Their training lacks the theory and context that other folk study, making them skilled in battle but relatively illiterate on the finer points of how and why their magic works.

## Hobgoblin Iron Shadow

The Iron Shadows are hobgoblin monks that serve as secret police, scouts, and assassins. Among other hobgoblins, they spy to ferret out treachery, rebellion, and betrayal.

***Trained in Secret.***  Iron Shadows are recruited from across the hobgoblin ranks. Each member keeps her eyes open for potential recruits, those whose agility and stamina are matched only by an ironclad commitment to Maglubiyet's will.

A candidate for admission undergoes a series of tests designed to reveal any potential for treachery. Those who fail are slain, while those who pass receive secret training in the magical and martial arts. This indoctrination is a slow and arduous process; many aspirants don't finish it, and years might go by during which the Iron Shadows welcome no new members into their ranks. While a recruit is in training, it serves the Iron Shadows by looking for and reporting suspicious behavior.

Their masks also signify the supposed origin of their fighting techniques. The priests of Maglubiyet teach that the Great One stole the secrets of shadows from an archdevil, allowing his followers to conceal their identities, walk between shadows, and craft illusions to confuse and confound their enemies.

***Masters of Shadow and Fist.***  When a recruit's training is complete, she is ready to wield a deadly combination of unarmed fighting techniques and shadow magic to deceive and defeat her foes. She continues to spy on other hobgoblins, but is now also empowered to conduct assassinations and spy missions, both against enemies and among goblinoids. These missions are ordained by the clerics of Maglubiyet, who keep a careful eye on the goblinoid community to ensure that it functions according to Maglubiyet's will.

***Masked Devils.***  Iron Shadows on a secret mission wear masks crafted to resemble devils, both to conceal their identities and to strike fear into their foes.

## Hobgoblin Iron Shadow Master

The Iron Shadow Master is often the abbot of a monastery that trains Iron Shadow monks. This hobgoblin has undergone decades of martial and magical arts training and can demonstrate supernatural abilities beyond that of a standard iron shadow monk, making it a very dangerous adversary. Its role is to oversee the development of recruits but, on occasion, it may be called upon by its lord to perform secret missions, such as assassinating a powerful target.

## Hobgoblin Warlock of the Legion

These militant warlocks have made pacts with archdevils and are loyal to Maglubiyet. They undergo the same training as devastators in the Academy of Devastation, only because they will ultimately serve in the hobgoblin armies. Only a few survive the dangerous process, though, and this isn't by accident.

## Hobgoblin Warlord

War horns sound, stones fly from catapults, and the thunder of a thousand booted feet echoes across the land as hobgoblins march to battle. Across the borderlands of civilization, settlements and settlers must contend with these aggressive humanoids, whose thirst for conquest is never satisfied.

Hobgoblins have dark orange or red-orange skin, and hair ranging from dark red-brown to dark gray. Yellow or dark brown eyes peer out beneath their beetling brows, and their wide mouths sport sharp and yellowed teeth. A male hobgoblin might have a large blue or red nose, which symbolizes virility and power among goblinkin. Hobgoblins can live as long as humans, though their love of warfare and battle means that few do.

***Goblinoids.*** Hobgoblins belong to a family of creatures called goblinoids. They are often found lording over their cousins, the smaller goblins and the ferocious bugbears.

***Martial Might.*** A hobgoblin measures virtue by physical strength and martial prowess, caring about nothing except the opportunity to demonstrate skill and cunning in battle. Hobgoblins of high military rank attain their positions by force, then hold those positions by imposing their authority through draconian measures.

Hobgoblins train to fight with a variety of weapons, and have great skill at crafting arms, armor, siege engines, and other military devices. Organized and disciplined, they take exceptional care of their weapons, armor, and personal possessions. They favor the bold colors associated with their tribes, and trim their often-elaborate uniforms with blood-red piping and leather dyed black.

***Military Legions.*** Hobgoblins organize themselves into tribal bands known as legions. In their martial society, every hobgoblin has a rank, from the powerful leaders and champions, to the rank-and-file foot soldiers, to the goblins that find themselves driven into the front lines at spear point. A legion is headed by a warlord with several captains serving under its command. A hobgoblin warlord is a ruthless tyrant more interested in strategy, victory, glory, reputation, and dominion than leading troops into battle.

As loyal and disciplined as hobgoblins are in their own legion, rival legions compete constantly for reputation and status. Meetings between legions erupt in violence if troops aren't restrained, and only exceptionally powerful leaders can force legions to cooperate on the battlefield.

***Strategic Thinkers.*** Hobgoblins have a strong grasp of tactics and discipline, and can carry out sophisticated battle plans under the direction of a strategically minded leader. However, they hate elves and attack them first in battle over any other opponents, even if doing so would be a tactical error.

Legions often supplement their ranks with less reliable and more expendable troops, including goblins, bugbears, orcs, evil humans, ogres, and giants.

***Beast Trainers.*** Hobgoblins have a long history of training animals to service. Like the more civilized races, they use oxen and horses to transport goods and weaponry over long distances. They communicate with each other using trained ravens, and keep vicious wolves to guard prisoners and protect hobgoblin camps. Hobgoblin cavalry use trained worgs as steeds, in the same way that goblins ride wolves. Some tribes even keep carnivorous apes as fighting beasts.

***Conquer and Control.*** Hobgoblins claim lands with abundant resources, and they can be found in forests and mountains, near mines and humanoid settlements, and anywhere else that wood, metal, and potential slaves can be found. They build and conquer strongholds in strategically advantageous locations, which they then use as staging areas to expand their territory.

Hobgoblin warlords never tire of combat, but they don't take up arms lightly. Before they attack, hobgoblins conduct thorough reconnaissance to gauge the strengths and weaknesses of their foes. When assaulting a stronghold, they surround it first to cut off escape routes and supply lines, then slowly starve their enemies out.

Hobgoblins fortify their own holdings, bolstering existing defenses with innovations of their own. Whether they lair in cavern complexes, dungeons, ruins, or forests, they protect their strongholds with ditches, fences, gates, guard towers, pit traps, and crude catapults or ballistas.

***Legion of Maglubiyet.*** Hobgoblins worship Maglubiyet the Mighty One, the greater god of goblinoids. As terrifying as this figure is, hobgoblins don't fear death, believing that when they die in battle, their spirits join the honored ranks of Maglubiyet's army on the plane of Acheron.

Limiting the power of a character and making the overall difficulty of the game harder, does not reduce the creativity, indeed it does quite the opposite.

The Game Master has the option to use any and all of the instances proposed in this guide, or just some of them according to their preference.

*It is the lack of something that move and motivate characters, not the abundance of it*

DESCRIPTION

Hobgoblins are a fierce humanoid race that wage a perpetual war with the other humanoid races. They are intelligent, organized, and aggressive. The typical hobgoblin is a burly humanoid standing 6 feet tall.

Their hairy hides range from dark reddish-brown to dark gray. Their faces show dark red or red-orange skin. Large males have blue or red noses. Hobgoblin eyes are either yellowish or dark brown while their teeth are yellow. Their garments tend to be brightly colored, often bold, blood red.

Any leather is always tinted black. Hobgoblin weaponry is kept polished and repaired. Hobgoblins have their own language and often speak with orcs, goblins, and carnivorous apes. Roughly 20% of them can speak the common tongue of man.

HABITAT / SOCIETY

Hobgoblins are nightmarish mockeries of the humanoid races who have a military society organized in tribal bands. Each tribe is intensely jealous of its status. Chance meetings with other tribes will result in verbal abuse or open fighting. Hobgoblin tribes are found in almost any climate or subterranean realm.

Hobgoblins usually organize in tribes. However, during wartime or important military campaigns, the tribes unite to form a legion.

A typical tribe of hobgoblins will have 2d100 adult male warriors.

- For every 20 male hobgoblins there will be 1 hobgoblin sergeant + 2 hobgoblin assistants with 20 hit points each.

- Groups numbering over 100 are led by a **hobgoblin sub-chief**.

- If the hobgoblins are encountered in their lair, they will be led by a **hobgoblin chief**. The chief has 5d4 hobgoblin sub-chiefs acting as bodyguards.

If the hobgoblins are encountered in a legion, there will be 10d100 of them, led by a **hobgoblin captain** or a **hobgoblin warlord** if the legion numbers more than 5,000 soldiers.

Each tribe has a distinctive battle standard which is carried into combat to inspire the troops. If the tribal chief is leading the battle, he will carry the standard with him, otherwise it will be held by one of his sub-chiefs.

In addition to the warriors present in a hobgoblin tribe, there will be half again that many females and three times as many children as adult males.

Fully 80% of all known hobgoblin lairs are subterranean complexes. The remaining 20% are surface villages which are fortified with a ditch, fence, at least two gates, and 1d4+2 guard towers. Villages are often built upon ruined humanoid settlements and may incorporate defensive features already present in the ruins.

Hobgoblin villages possess artillery in the form of 2 heavy catapults, 2 light catapults, and 1 ballista for each 50 warriors.

ECOLOGY

Hobgoblins feel superior to goblins or orcs and may act as leaders for them. In such cases, the "lesser races" are used as battle fodder. Hobgoblin mercenaries may work for powerful or rich evil humanoids.

## Hobgoblin Warlord of Nomog-geaya

This hobgoblin is a cunning and oppressive general favored by Nomog-Geaya, the ironfisted hobgoblin deity of tyranny and war who serves Maglubiyet in military matters. This warlord commands entire hobgoblin armies with brutal and ruthless efficiency.

In combat, the warlord prefers to direct its troops and watch how its strategies unfold. If forced to fight, however, the warlord is more than just a capable fighter. It is an expert in fighting with a longsword and a handaxe, able to parry foes with either weapon and surprising them with a counter blow.

## Jingle Jangle

Jingle Jangle's obsession with keys serves as a cautionary tale for those who would enter into a bargain with Bavlorna Blightstraw. The goblin once sought the hag's help in a desperate attempt to undo what she thought was a terrible curse: wherever Jingle Jangle went, she felt a tormenting fear of being caught on the wrong side of a locked door. When she appealed to Bavlorna for aid, the hag removed the goblin's ability to perceive that fear and replaced it with an insatiable and overwhelming need to collect keys. So great is this obsession that Jingle Jangle has lost her own sense of self and now refers to herself only in the third person.

Jingle Jangle is a kind soul who refers to herself in the third person. She has a knack for finding keys and is thrilled to add new ones to her collection. She also gives keys as gifts to those who need them.

Jingle Jangle seeks a quiet life far away from locked doors and the intrigues of the fey courts. She moved to Telemy Hill to enjoy the hill's companionship and protection.

## Nilbog

When Maglubiyet conquered the goblin gods, he intended to leave only Khurgorbaeyag alive as a harsh overseer who would keep the goblins under heel. But the goblins' pantheon included a trickster deity who was determined to get the last laugh. Although its essence was shattered by Maglubiyet, this trickster god survives in splintered form as a possessing spirit that arises when goblinoids form a host, causing disorder in the ranks unless it is appeased. Goblins have no name for this deity and dare not give it one, lest Maglubiyet use its name to ensnare and crush it as he did their other deities. They call the possessing spirit, and the goblin possessed by it, a nilbog ("goblin" spelled backward), and they revel in the fear that a nilbog sows among the ranks of the bugbears and hobgoblins in the host.

***Goblins' Revenge.***  When goblinoids form a host, there is a chance that a goblin will become possessed by a nilbog, particularly if the goblin has been mistreated by its betters. This possession turns the goblin into a wisecracking, impish creature fearless of reprisal. It gives the goblin strange powers that drive others to do the opposite of what they desire. Attacking a goblin possessed by a nilbog is foolhardy, and killing the creature just prompts the spirit to possess another goblin. The only way to keep a nilbog from wreaking havoc is to treat it well and give it respect and praise.

***No Joking Matter.***  The possible presence of a nilbog in a host has given rise to a practice among goblinoids that each host include at least one goblin jester. This jester is allowed to go anywhere and do whatever it pleases. The position of jester is a much sought-after one among the goblins, because even if the jester is obviously not a nilbog, hobgoblins and bugbears indulge its manic behavior.

***Nilbogism.*** A nilbog is an invisible spirit that possesses only goblins. Bereft of a host, the spirit has a flying speed of 30 feet and can't speak or be attacked. The only action it can take is to attempt to possess a goblin within 5 feet of it.

A goblin targeted by the spirit must succeed on a DC 15 Charisma saving throw or become possessed. While possessed by the spirit, the goblin's alignment becomes chaotic evil, its Charisma becomes 15 (unless it was already higher), and it gains the nilbog's Innate Spellcasting and Nilbogism traits, as well as its Reversal of Fortune reaction. If the save succeeds, the spirit can't possess that goblin for 24 hours. If its host is killed or the possession is ended by a spell such as hallow, magic circle, or protection from evil and good, the spirit searches for another goblin to possess. The spirit can leave its host at any time, but it won't do so willingly unless it knows there's another potential host nearby. A goblin stripped of its nilbog spirit reverts to its normal statistics and loses the traits it gained while possessed.

## Norker

Cruel, vicious, and lazy even by the standards of goblinoids, norkers are tough humanoids whose long, sharp fangs and thick, bony exoskeletons make them well-suited to the ranks of hobgoblin armies. Unfortunately for their would-be masters, norkers are rebellious, truculent, and prone to indolence unless watched with a keen eye and a hand that is quick to snap a whip.

***Denizens of the Deep Earth.*** In the ancient days, norkers were found deep within the earth. They were always few in number, and their god was a cruel, merciless tyrant who kept his children close and the outside world at a distance. This long-lost god may have been Maglubiyet's first conquest and his followers the initial, unwilling recruits into his crusade. Today, hobgoblins chafe at the suggestion that creatures as lazy and untamed as norkers could claim such an honor. For that reason alone, hobgoblin warlords are loath to use these creatures, preferring to keep them around as disposable labor in mines and quarries.

***Nasty, Brutish, and Short.*** Even goblins bully and harass norkers, as hobgoblins place the norkers at the bottom of the goblinoid ranks, yet the norkers' ferocity, tough hides, and sharp fangs allow them to rise up and defeat goblinoids that underestimate the norkers' strength and ferocity.. For this reason, norkers are likely encountered away from their brethren. Their natural armor and weapons make them dangerous foes even when relegated to menial labor. Only the dictates of Maglubiyet have prevented the hobgoblins from hunting down and exterminating these creatures.

***A Legacy of Hatred.*** Given their ancient defeat and terrible treatment at the hands of other goblinoids, the norkers have developed a peculiar sect of Maglubiyet worshipper. They call him the Great Scourge and believe that mortal life is a cruel test. Those norkers whose skin can withstand any blow and whose fangs sink deep into their enemies will be shepherded to paradise. To the norkers, all other creatures are enemies. Strong creatures can be mollified with servitude and obsequious begging, while weaker ones are victims for their fangs and clubs.

## Ravager Stabby-Stabber

Whether driven by resentment for being shunned by the fairer folk, or consumed by the burning fury that still drives them since the corruption of the Ruiner's blood in the Calamity, most orcs are a chaotic force of destruction. They are a threat to civilization, to be sure, but more a mindless force of nature than a coordinated menace.

However, with each generation, some orcs grow smarter: more organized, learning from their foes, and understanding the might in well-led numbers. This growing horde of calculating, ruthless murder is known as the Ravagers, and with each defeat, they learn. And grow stronger still.

Tales of the bloodthirsty Ravagers have spread from Kymal across Tal'Dorei. Most adventurers and mercenaries take up arms against the Ravager after hearing stories of muscle-bound orcs terrorizing the free people of the Dividing Plains. They are prepared for single combat with great foes. They are not prepared for the Ravagers' most terrifying weapon: the stabby-stabbers. Fresh-faced warriors from Emon laugh at the name when they first hear it in Kymal's taverns, but veteran mercenaries close their eyes and hastily bury their face in their tankards.

Goblins only join the Ravagers as slaves; spoils from orcish raids of goblin nests. Those that show exceptional skill are brought before their Slaughter Lord and forced to drink a terrible brew the orcs call skullfire. The concoction burns what little reason the goblins had away, turning them into perfectly obedient, flesh-hungry monsters. In battle, stabby-stabbers swarm like rats, eviscerating fleeing innocents and warriors alike in seconds.

## Shadow Goblin

*This hunched and scrawny goblin has a long nose and pointed ears and wears an insincere, obsequious expression on its slategrey face. Dressed in a servant's uniform, it conceals a large knife behind its back.*

***Unseelie Servants.*** Someone needs to cook the meals, scrub the floors, and polish the silverware in the courts of the shadow fey, and more often than not these jobs fall on the shadow goblins. Smarter than the average goblin but just as cowardly and lazy, shadow goblins have served the shadow fey for centuries, working in the kitchens, stables, and smithies under the direction of a chamberlain known as the Goblin King, who presides over his own "court" below stairs. Shadow goblins make good cooks and reasonable grooms, but they are indifferent footmen and chambermaids.

***Touched by Shadow.*** Most shadow goblins were originally average goblins but living in the Shadow Realm for so long has changed them. They have taken on some of their masters' fey qualities. Others were once shadow fey or humans, who were caught stealing from powerful members of the courts or who offended shadow fey rulers and were transformed into shadow goblins as punishment.

***Untrustworthy Guides.*** Outsiders of low status visiting the shadow fey courts often end up relying on shadow goblins as guides and sources of information. Unfortunately, the goblins tend to be both annoyingly whiny and notorious liars. Although they are easily intimidated, shadow goblins are never truly cooperative and will disappear at the first sign of danger. Their loyalty to their shadow fey masters is born out of fear. They are reluctant to do anything that is likely to upset their masters and lead to a thrashing. Those outsiders that bully the goblins tend to suffer subsequently from badly-cooked food, missing bits of gear, and other petty acts of retribution.

>***Absorb Attack.*** When a creature Splugoth can see hits him with a melee weapon attack, the weapon snags on a pocket of residual resurrectional energy and is caught fast. The attack is negated and the weapon cannot be used until the creature succeeds on a DC 12 Strength (Athletics) check as an action to pull it out of Splugoth. Natural weapons can have their attacks negated by this feature, but can then be retracted automatically at the end of the attacking creature's turn.

## Splugoth the Returned

*I'm going to give you a piece of advice. Don't trust Acquisitions Incorporated. And never, ever, ever trust Omin Dran. Wait, that's two pieces of advice. You owe me.*Sometimes a goblin can't catch a break. First, you fall in with a cult that works for the release of a death god. Then you get taken prisoner by a group of sociopathic adventurers who end up letting you die after you save their sorry lives. One minute, you're a dead goblin named Splug. And then you're alive again, and it seems like a really good idea to play up the drama of resurrection with a cool new name-and a master plan for cold, cold revenge against those who betrayed you.

Every once in a while, the (accidentally) capricious and (totally unintentionally) self-centered nature of an Acquisitions Incorporated franchise might incur some collateral damage among followers, hirelings, and staff. When that happens, the collateral damage sometimes inspires some collateral damage of its own. No one is entirely sure how many times Splugoth the Returned has actually returned from the dead. But as the point goblin for the group known as the Six (see "Factions and Rivals" in chapter 3), he's made vengeance against Acq Inc and Omin Dran his life's work. And then the work of his next life. And the one after that.

## Tasloi

Lanky but small goblin-like creatures, tasloi largely dwell in the dense tropical forests of southern Faerûn. However, groups of tasloi have made their way northwards to the Sword Coast, with a notable enclave within the Cloakwood. With vibrant green skin covered by a thin layer of coarse black hair, tasloi can perfectly blend in with their surroundings with only the faint glow of their golden, almost feline eyes betraying their presence. Although generally less intelligent than humans, tasloi can be quite clever, using superior numbers and pack tactics to make them surprisingly formidable foes.

***Tree Dwellers.*** Tasloi prefer the low-light conditions of jungle canopies and avoid direct sunlight altogether. In more temperate areas where foliage is sparse, such as the forests of the Sword Coast, they largely limit their activities to dawn and dusk. Expert climbers, the tasloi's long arms allow them to rapidly move among treetops by leaping from branches and swinging from vines. Tasloi are less at home on the ground, where they knuckle-walk by adopting a crouched position similar to that of an ape.

***Social Creatures.*** Tasloi live in a loosely structured tribal society together in bands that consist of multiple individual families. Most tasloi communities build homes in trees surrounded by interconnected platforms high off the ground. Tasloi have a deep fear of being alone, which is reinforced by their culture's many superstitions. They practice a form of husbandry, raising giant rats and other large vermin as livestock, both for food and use as mounts. Tasloi mostly speak a language unique to their kind, but some have learned to speak a broken form of Common. Although vicious, these opportunists can be reasoned with under the right circumstances.

***Ambush Predators.*** Although tasloi can and will eat almost anything, they have a strong preference for fresh meat, especially that of humans, elves, and other humanoids. They are known take advantage of much more fearsome monsters by staking out escape routes from their lairs and luring already-injured adventurers into a trap. Tasloi also use hit-and-run tactics and other techniques that take advantage of their familiarity with their forest homes.

## Tasloi Sniper

Lanky but small goblin-like creatures, tasloi largely dwell in the dense tropical forests of southern Faerûn. However, groups of tasloi have made their way northwards to the Sword Coast, with a notable enclave within the Cloakwood. With vibrant green skin covered by a thin layer of coarse black hair, tasloi can perfectly blend in with their surroundings with only the faint glow of their golden, almost feline eyes betraying their presence. Although generally less intelligent than humans, tasloi can be quite clever, using superior numbers and pack tactics to make them surprisingly formidable foes.

## Werebat

A werebat is a humanoid afflicted with a rare form of lycanthropy that enables it to transform into a giant bat or a bat-humanoid hybrid. (See the *Monster Manual* for more information on*lycanthropy*.) Most werebats are of goblin stock.

***Deep Dwellers.*** Werebats are shunned even by goblin society because of their need to feed on blood to survive. They prefer to lair in dark places, such as attics and caves, and typically adopt nocturnal hunting habits.

***Blood Drinkers.*** A werebat must consume at least 1 pint of fresh blood each night, or it weakens and gains one level of exhaustion that no amount of rest alone can remove. Each pint of blood the werebat consumes removes one level of exhaustion gained in this fashion.

***Werebat Lycanthropy.*** A player character who becomes a werebat gains a Dexterity of 17 if their score isn't already higher. Attack and damage rolls for the werebat's bite attack are based on the character's Strength or Dexterity score, whichever is higher.
