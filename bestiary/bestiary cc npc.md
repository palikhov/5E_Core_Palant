## Arcana Priest

### Arcana Priest
Arcana priests reject the notion that divine and arcane magic are fundamentally different. They believe that magic, just as all things, come from the will of the gods and should be worshipped as such.

### Gods of the Arcana Priests

#### Azuth, God of Wizards
Followers find their homes piling up with books of arcane knowledge they have no recollection of acquiring.

#### Mystra, Goddess of Magic
Opposing magic always seems to just barely miss followers. They're just outside of the blast of a fireball, or the eldritch blast strikes their ally instead, or a paladin decides to use his words rather than a zone of truth.

#### Oghma, God of Knowledge
Followers are occasionally struck by facts they would have had no way of figuring out on their own.

## Arch Shepherd

### War Priest (PHB)
War priests view battlefields as sacred ground. While not soldiers themselves, they are often found among the ranks of armies, providing aid and bolstering the resolve of their allies to spur them into victory. Even a lost battle, and death at the hands of the enemy, is something to strive for in the eyes of a war priest.

### Gods of the War Priests
The war priest in Volo's Guide to Monsters is sufficient to represent this subclass.

#### Tempus, God of War
No follower has ever been caught at home when there's a fight to be had.

#### Nearly everyone has a story of the heroism of a dead follower they once knew.
bbb

#### Tyr, God of Justice
Followers are capable of coming to moral and ethical conclusions in a fraction of a second, and their decisions are almost always fair.

## Death Priest

### Death Priest (DMG)
Death priests worship foul gods. While some might intend to further the study of medicine and alleviate the suffering of those in need, most are drawn to this domain by the blackness in their hearts.

### Gods of the Death Priests

#### Bhaal, God of Murder
Followers must wipe their faces to remove the blood that periodically leaks from their eyes.

#### Kelemvor, God of the Dead
Out of the corner of one's eye, one can see, only through the reflection of a mirror, a skeletal apparition where the follower would be standing.

#### Loviatar, Goddess of Pain
Followers can withstand brutal torture without breaking a sweat.

#### Myrkul, God of Death
Followers are pale as a ghost.

#### Shar, Goddess of Darkness and Loss
Followers frequently seem to disappear into the shadows.

Followers are carriers and spreaders of countless debilitating diseases, yet suffer no symptoms themselves.

## Forge Priest

### Forge Priest (XGE)
A priest won't consider themselves worthy of the domain of the forge unless they have produced armor worthy of combat against demons and other creatures that would challenge the forward march of civilisation.

## Knowledge Priest

### Knowledge Priest (PHB)
Knowledge priests took a liking to the studious nature of their profession rather than the martial responsibilities.

### Gods of the Knowledge Priests

#### Azuth, God of Wizards
Followers find their homes piling up with books of arcane knowledge they have no recollection of acquiring.

#### Deneir, God of Writing
Followers often carry a quill pen that never seems to run out of ink, and their packs are always filled with paper.

#### Gond, God of Craft
Followers suffer agonising dreams of others destroying their creations and live in constant paranoia when working on a project around others.

#### Mystra, Goddess of Magic
Opposing magic always seems to just barely miss followers. They're just outside of the blast of a fireball, or the eldritch blast strikes their ally instead, or a paladin decides to use his words rather than a zone of truth.

#### Oghma, God of Knowledge
Followers are occasionally struck by facts they would have had no way of figuring out on their own.

#### Savras, God of Divination and Fate
Keen observers know to avoid a room that a follower refuses to walk into.

#### Selune, Goddess of the Moon
In the waxing period, followers are exuberant, youthful, and optimistic. In the waning period, followers are mellow, dour, and pessimistic.

#### Waukeen, Goddess of Trade
There isn't a business deal in the known world that doesn't benefit a follower in some obscure, roundabout way.
