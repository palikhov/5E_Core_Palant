## Black Sun Orc

*Pale-skinned and strong as an ox, the Black Sun orcs worship strength and violence and feast on the cracked bones of their enemies.*

***Hidden by the Earth.*** Black Sun orcs excel at concealing their deeds from those on the surface world, lying in wait at night to abduct victims from the roads or their homes in near complete silence. The orcs bundle off such unfortunates to the concealed caverns leading to their homes beneath the earth, where they hand the captives over to their priestesses for sacrifice.

***Nocturnal Attacks.*** Black Sun orcs are strictly nocturnal, avoiding the eye of the sun in favor of raids under moonlight—and even these do not take place during the full moon.

***Foes of Trolls and Goblins.*** Trolls, trollkin, and goblins find the fish-bellied coloration and peculiar speech of Black Sun orcs hilarious and mock them mercilessly. In most cases, this ends in a fight with one side or the other driven away.

## Black Sun Priestess

*With a fondness for cracking open ribcages and pulling out beating hearts, Black Sun priestesses are always on the lookout for the next sacrifice to their blasphemous gods.*

With her devotion painted in blood across her breast and her eyes alight with fervor for her dark faith, the Black Sun priestess embraces her cruel duties with relish.

## Bresh Hens'lass

**Half-orc Watcher of Eastern Dunwood**

This gruff half-orc has inherited the watch of eastern Dunwood from her deceased adoptive father, Hensoi. The kindly druid is still well remembered by the folk in the eastern Dale, and Bresh has earned their same grudging respect.

Bresh recalls little of her life before Hensoi took her in. She still lives in Nighthawk Tower,  occasionally leaving flowers on top of the stone cairn at its base where Hensoi is buried. Bresh doesn't belong to the Circle of Leth, but she is on good relations with them. They regularly consult with her on the goings on of the eastern wood.

In her travels, Bresh is usually accompanied by her **giant badger** animal companion she calls Chomps.

## Gray Orc

*The ground erupts into a scrambling flood of orcs, their pale skin decorated with swirls of black resin.*Dwelling deep beneath the ground, gray orcs move in a dark world, only drawn toward the surface by their innate hatred of arcane defilement.

***Drawn to Magical Corruption.*** Gray orcs are drawn to areas where magic is frequently used or locations marred by magical pollution. Scholars believe the orcs' ancestral home was ravaged by magic, cursing them and driving them deep beneath the surface. They believe this history fuels within the orcs a deep hatred for magic, especially magic that defiles the natural world. For their part, the orcs have neither confirmed nor denied this speculation, though few scholars have been brave enough to approach them about it. Whatever the case, gray orcs grow violent around magic and seek to snuff it out wherever they find it.

***Synchronized Tribes.*** Gray orcs move and act as one, their training leading their actions to be so synchronized that they appear to think as one. When faced with a major threat or a large magical catastrophe, a group of gray orcs will erupt from the ground in unison to swarm over the source.

***Silent Hunters.*** Adept at surviving in a dark and quiet world below the ground, gray orcs instinctively know how to move, hunt, and kill without making the slightest sound. When they hunt, gray orcs paint their pale skin with swirls of a mushroom-based black resin. They often form the resin into runes or symbols of their gods as a way of honoring the gods and asking for success on the hunt.

If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw, taking 9 (2d8) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. If the poison damage reduces the target to 0 hp, the target is stable but poisoned for 1 hour, even after regaining hp, and is paralyzed while poisoned in this way.

## Green Abyss Orc

*Dwelling in the eternal twilight of deep jungles and shadowy canyons, these orcs are fond of plant camouflage and are sometimes covered in armor featuring plant spikes and spines. All are expert climbers.*

***Nocturnal Menace.*** Sheltering by day in caverns just beneath the surface, the orcs of the green abyss climb up into the world with the fall of night to hunt and make war in the jungle canopy. They often align themselves with particularly bloodthirsty druids and with **vine lords** ([Tome of Beasts](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/creature/Kobold Press; Tome of Beasts.json)). They are immune to the vine lord's spore sacs and can't be transformed into tendril puppets.

***Canopy-Dwelling Predators.*** Leaner and rangier than others of their kind, they stalk among the branches, spearing their prey below with poisons harvested from the deadly plants native to their home. Their nocturnal hunting hideaways resemble those of large apes; leafy nests that are difficult to spot from the ground.

***Fierce Survivalists.*** Adept at surviving in an unforgiving world, these orcs survive through a mastery of poisons, use of simple-but-effective traps they leave for the unwary, and by snatching meals from the grip of man-eating flora. They are omnivorous and fond of devouring enormous beetles, roaches, and snakes which other humanoids would pass over.

## Hrabbaz

Hrabbaz is a muscle-bound half-orc with a cleft palate who serves the lord and lady of House Gralhund as a bodyguard. He is well mannered and dresses impeccably-a disarming appearance that belies a murderous heart. Though he has great respect for Lady Yalah Gralhund, he is less fond of her moody husband, and wouldn't be sad to see Orond knocked down a peg or two.

## Nauk

Nauk is a half-orc warrior and senior member of the Flaming Fist in Baldur's Gate. He is also one of Faerûn's most notorious arms dealers. Nauk feeds the flames of civil strife in other nations, usually by providing assassins, mercenaries or magic. When outright war breaks out, the Flaming Fist is ready to offer their services for a hefty profit.

Nauk is one of the most well-connected members of the Flaming Fist. He has contacts and friends in almost every nation and city state in western Faerûn. Some of these come from his younger years as an adventurer, while others have been made through his arms deals.

Nauk is not above getting his hands dirty and has earned his nickname—the Bag Man. Sometimes his customers renege on a deal or are unable to pay for the services that he has provided. When this happens, Nauk enjoys making an object lesson out of the poor fool. Depending on who needs to be punished, Nauk either shows up with a small band of the Flaming Fist's hardest veterans or with a small army. No matter who he arrives with, Nauk always takes the lead.

Nauk dresses in full battle gear, even when just sitting down for a discussion with a possible client. This is because what he wears and wields are examples of what he can provide to a potential customer. This includes adamantine plate armor, multiple enchanted weapons and a dozen potions and other minor magic items. If he needs to convince a client of the effectiveness of what he has to sell, he will offer to fight the best warrior they can send at him.

### Nauk as a Contact
Nauk is the primary contact for members of the Flaming Fist at low levels. Magic items can be purchased from Nauk. He specializes in selling potions.

## Orc

Orcs are savage raiders and pillagers with stooped postures, low foreheads, and piggish faces with prominent lower canines that resemble tusks.

***Gruumsh One-Eye.***  Orcs worship Gruumsh, the mightiest of the orc deities and their creator. The orcs believe that in ancient days, the gods gathered to divide the world among their followers. When Gruumsh claimed the mountains, he learned they had been taken by the dwarves. He laid claim to the forests, but those had been settled by the elves. Each place that Gruumsh wanted had already been claimed. The other gods laughed at Gruumsh, but he responded with a furious bellow. Grasping his mighty spear, he laid waste to the mountains, set the forests aflame, and carved great furrows in the fields. Such was the role of the orcs, he proclaimed, to take and destroy all that the other races would deny them. To this day, the orcs wage an endless war on humans, elves, dwarves, and other folk.

Orcs hold a particular hatred for elves. The elven god Corellon Larethian half-blinded Gruumsh with a well-placed arrow to the orc god's eye. Since then, the orcs have taken particular joy in slaughtering elves. Turning his injury into a baleful gift, Gruumsh grants divine might to any champion who willingly plucks out one of its eyes in his honor.

***Tribes like Plagues.*** Orcs gather in tribes that exert their dominance and satisfy their bloodlust by plundering villages, devouring or driving off roaming herds, and slaying any humanoids that stand against them. After savaging a settlement, orcs pick it clean of wealth and items usable in their own lands. They set the remains of villages and camps ablaze, then retreat whence they came, their bloodlust satisfied.

***Ranging Scavengers.*** Their lust for slaughter demands that orcs dwell always within striking distance of new targets. As such, they seldom settle permanently, instead converting ruins, cavern complexes, and defeated foes' villages into fortified camps and strongholds. Orcs build only for defense, making no innovation or improvement to their lairs beyond mounting the severed body parts of their victims on spiked stockade walls or pikes jutting up from moats and trenches.

When an existing territory is depleted of food, an orc tribe divides into roving bands that scout for choice hunting grounds. When each party returns, it brings back trophies and news of targets ripe for attack, the richest of which is chosen. The tribe then sets out en masse to carve a bloody path to its new territory.

On rare occasions, a tribe's leader chooses to hold onto a particularly defensible lair for decades. The orcs of such a tribe must range far across the countryside to sate their appetites.

***Leadership and Might.*** Orc tribes are mostly patriarchal, flaunting such vivid or grotesque titles as Many-Arrows, Screaming Eye, and Elf Ripper. Occasionally, a powerful war chief unites scattered orc tribes into a single rampaging horde, which runs roughshod over other orc tribes and humanoid settlements from a position of overwhelming strength.

Strength and power are the greatest of orcish virtues, and orcs embrace all manner of mighty creatures in their tribes. Rejecting notions of racial purity, they proudly welcome ogres, trolls, half-orcs, and orogs into their ranks. As well, orcs respect and fear the size and power of evil giants, and often serve them as guards and soldiers.

***Orc Crossbreeds.*** Luthic, the orc goddess of fertility and wife of Gruumsh, demands that orcs procreate often and indiscriminately so that orc hordes swell generation after generation. The orcs' drive to reproduce runs stronger than any other humanoid race, and they readily crossbreed with other races. When an orc procreates with a non-orc humanoid of similar size and stature (such as a human or a dwarf), the resulting child is either an orc or a half-orc. When an orc produces young with an ogre, the child is a half-ogre of intimidating strength and brutish features called an ogrillon.

## Orc Blade of Ilneval

To the common folk of the world, an orc is an orc. They know that any one of these savages can tear an ordinary person to pieces, so no further distinction is necessary.

Orcs know better. Different groups of orcs exist within a tribe, the actions of each dictated by the deity they pay homage to. To complement the various kinds of warriors that spill forth to ravage the countryside, each tribe has members that remain deep inside the lair, seldom if ever seeing what lies outside the darkness of their den.

In addition, orcs have special relationships with two creatures that are sometimes found in their company: the aurochs, a great bull that serves as a mount for warriors that revere Bahgtru, and the tanarukk, a demon-orc crossbreed that is so depraved and destructive that even orcs seek to kill it. The aurochs is described in appendix A. The tanarukk is described below.

***Orc Blade of Ilneval.*** Ilneval is Gruumsh's battle captain, a devious strategist who directs Gruumsh's soldiers with boldness. Among orcs, warriors that venerate Ilneval emulate their deity. Such orcs learn to command their fellows in ways that are unpredictable but help to ensure victory.

The wisest among these leaders gain Ilneval's favor and rise to become known as blades, tactical experts who advise their chief in matters of war. Blades lead from the front, wading into combat fearlessly while barking orders at lesser soldiers. A blade knows how to use orcish ferocity to best advantage, and helps the ordinary warriors to work together against their adversaries.

On a failed save, the target has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks, and can't take reactions. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. A target that regains all of its hit points also ends the effect.

## Orc Claw of Luthic

To the common folk of the world, an orc is an orc. They know that any one of these savages can tear an ordinary person to pieces, so no further distinction is necessary.

Orcs know better. Different groups of orcs exist within a tribe, the actions of each dictated by the deity they pay homage to. To complement the various kinds of warriors that spill forth to ravage the countryside, each tribe has members that remain deep inside the lair, seldom if ever seeing what lies outside the darkness of their den.

In addition, orcs have special relationships with two creatures that are sometimes found in their company: the aurochs, a great bull that serves as a mount for warriors that revere Bahgtru, and the tanarukk, a demon-orc crossbreed that is so depraved and destructive that even orcs seek to kill it. The aurochs is described in appendix A. The tanarukk is described below.

***Orc Claw of Luthic.*** Luthic is Gruumsh's wife and the paragon of maternity to all orcs. She is the Cave Mother, a fierce dweller in the darkness who raises new broods of orcs to be vicious and strong. Her symbol is the cave bear, and orc females raise such bears alongside orc whelps. Females particularly attracted to Luthic grow long nails and lacquer them, learning to use these claws as weapons much as Luthic uses her own.

Orc females devoted to Luthic are in charge of fortifying and maintaining an orc stronghold. They help to guarantee the survival of the tribe, and most are skilled in the healing arts. The most powerful among Luthic's disciples are the claws of Luthic, which can use the Cave Mother's magic to heal, protect, and curse.

## Orc Eye of Gruumsh

When an orc slays an elf in Gruumsh's name and offers the corpse of its foe as a sacrifice to the god of slaughter, an aspect of the god might appear. This aspect demands an additional sacrifice: one of the orc's eyes, symbolizing the loss Gruumsh suffered at the hands of his greatest enemy, Corellon Larethian.

If the orc plucks out one of its eyes, Gruumsh might grant the orc spellcasting ability and special favor, along with the right to call itself an Eye of Gruumsh. When not using their auguries to advise their war chiefs, these savage devotees of the god of slaughter hurl themselves into battle, their weapons stained with blood.

***Orcs.*** Orcs are savage raiders and pillagers with stooped postures, low foreheads, and piggish faces with prominent lower canines that resemble tusks.

***Gruumsh One-Eye.***  Orcs worship Gruumsh, the mightiest of the orc deities and their creator. The orcs believe that in ancient days, the gods gathered to divide the world among their followers. When Gruumsh claimed the mountains, he learned they had been taken by the dwarves. He laid claim to the forests, but those had been settled by the elves. Each place that Gruumsh wanted had already been claimed. The other gods laughed at Gruumsh, but he responded with a furious bellow. Grasping his mighty spear, he laid waste to the mountains, set the forests aflame, and carved great furrows in the fields. Such was the role of the orcs, he proclaimed, to take and destroy all that the other races would deny them. To this day, the orcs wage an endless war on humans, elves, dwarves, and other folk.

Orcs hold a particular hatred for elves. The elven god Corellon Larethian half-blinded Gruumsh with a well-placed arrow to the orc god's eye. Since then, the orcs have taken particular joy in slaughtering elves. Turning his injury into a baleful gift, Gruumsh grants divine might to any champion who willingly plucks out one of its eyes in his honor.

***Tribes like Plagues.*** Orcs gather in tribes that exert their dominance and satisfy their bloodlust by plundering villages, devouring or driving off roaming herds, and slaying any humanoids that stand against them. After savaging a settlement, orcs pick it clean of wealth and items usable in their own lands. They set the remains of villages and camps ablaze, then retreat whence they came, their bloodlust satisfied.

When an existing territory is depleted of food, an orc tribe divides into roving bands that scout for choice hunting grounds. When each party returns, it brings back trophies and news of targets ripe for attack, the richest of which is chosen. The tribe then sets out en masse to carve a bloody path to its new territory.

On rare occasions, a tribe's leader chooses to hold onto a particularly defensible lair for decades. The orcs of such a tribe must range far across the countryside to sate their appetites.

Strength and power are the greatest of orcish virtues, and orcs embrace all manner of mighty creatures in their tribes. Rejecting notions of racial purity, they proudly welcome ogres, trolls, half-orcs, and orogs into their ranks. As well, orcs respect and fear the size and power of evil giants, and often serve them as guards and soldiers.

***Ranging Scavengers.***  Their lust for slaughter demands that orcs dwell always within striking distance of new targets. As such, they seldom settle permanently, instead converting ruins, cavern complexes, and defeated foes' villages into fortified camps and strongholds. Orcs build only for defense, making no innovation or improvement to their lairs beyond mounting the severed body parts of their victims on spiked stockade walls or pikes jutting up from moats and trenches.

***Leadership and Might.***  Orc tribes are mostly patriarchal, flaunting such vivid or grotesque titles as Many-Arrows, Screaming Eye, and Elf Ripper. Occasionally, a powerful war chief unites scattered orc tribes into a single rampaging horde, which runs roughshod over other orc tribes and humanoid settlements from a position of overwhelming strength.

***Orc Crossbreeds.***  Luthic, the orc goddess of fertility and wife of Gruumsh, demands that orcs procreate often and indiscriminately so that orc hordes swell generation after generation. The orcs' drive to reproduce runs stronger than any other humanoid race, and they readily crossbreed with other races. When an orc procreates with a non-orc humanoid of similar size and stature (such as a human or a dwarf), the resulting child is either an orc or a half-orc. When an orc produces young with an ogre, the child is a half-ogre of intimidating strength and brutish features called an ogrillon.

## Orc Fist of Bahgtru

This fearsome and brutish orc is the favored warrior of Bahgtru the Leg Breaker, the orc deity of strength, and the son of Gruumsh and Luthic. Like its patron, the Orc Fist of Bahgtru prefers to only use its fists instead of melee weapons. It wears spiked gauntlets that are always stained with blood. In combat, it clobbers its foes with vicious hammer fists and snaps their bones like twigs.

Orcs know better. Different groups of orcs exist within a tribe, the actions of each dictated by the deity they pay homage to.

The aurochs is described in appendix A. The tanarukk is described below.

***Orc Hand of Yurtrus.*** Yurtrus is the orc god of death and disease. He is a horrifying abomination covered in rot and infection, except for his perfect, smooth white hands.

Orc priests that oversee the line between life and death are known by the others in the tribe as hands of Yurtrus. They dwell on the fringes of an orc lair, usually communing with other orcs through the auspices of those who follow Luthic. The hands of Yurtrus wear pale gloves made of the bleached skin of other humanoids (preferably elves), symbolizing their connection with Yurtrus, and are sometimes called "white hands" as a result.

Every orc knows that the hands of Yurtrus are the tribe's gateway to the ancestors. Orcs who die having served the tribe well go on to rituals meant to send them to Gruumsh's realm.

As befits followers of a god who doesn't speak, hands of Yurtrus remove their tongues to emulate their deity, for a reason similar to why an eye of Gruumsh puts out one of its eyes.

## Orc Nurtured One of Yurtrus

To the common folk of the world, an orc is an orc. They know that any one of these savages can tear an ordinary person to pieces, so no further distinction is necessary.

Orcs know better. Different groups of orcs exist within a tribe, the actions of each dictated by the deity they pay homage to. To complement the various kinds of warriors that spill forth to ravage the countryside, each tribe has members that remain deep inside the lair, seldom if ever seeing what lies outside the darkness of their den.

In addition, orcs have special relationships with two creatures that are sometimes found in their company: the aurochs, a great bull that serves as a mount for warriors that revere Bahgtru, and the tanarukk, a demon-orc crossbreed that is so depraved and destructive that even orcs seek to kill it. The aurochs is described in appendix A. The tanarukk is described below.

***Orc Nurtured One of Yurtrus.*** When plague strikes a tribe, the hands of Yurtrus isolate the sick. The priests then minister to those who can be saved but not healed. The hands cultivate the sickness of these nurtured ones, turning them into instruments of defense and weapons of war. When orcs go to battle, a band of nurtured ones might charge in first-to give themselves up while softening up the enemy by spreading Yurtrus's vile blessing in its ranks.

The aurochs is described in appendix A. The tanarukk is described below.

***Orc Red Fang of Shargaas.*** Shargaas is the orc deity of deep darkness and sneakiness, a murderous god who hates anything that lives that isn't an orc. Orcs consider Shargaas to be a divinity suited to pariahs and weaklings, all of them unfit for true roles in tribal life. These outsiders live in the most remote, deepest parts of the tribe's domain.

The elite among Shargaas's followers are the assassins and thieves that follow the cult of the Red Fang. They perform assassinations, stealthy raids, and other covert operations on the tribe's behalf. They rely on a mix of intense training and magic granted to them by Shargaas.

Most Red Fang enclaves keep and nurture giant bats, creatures that are sacred to Shargaas. Red Fangs ride these bats into battle or on secret raids and assassination missions into enemy territory.

## Orc War Chief

The war chief of an orc tribe is its strongest and most cunning member. The reign of a war chief lasts only as long as it commands the fear and respect of other tribe members, whose bloodlust must be regularly satisfied lest the chief appear weak. Scions of Slaughter. Gruumsh bestows special blessings upon war chiefs who prove themselves in battle time and again, imbuing them with slivers of his savagery. A war chief so blessed finds that his weapons cut deeper into his enemies, allowing him to inflict more carnage.

King Obould Many-Arrows

King Obould of the Many-Arrows tribe is a legend among the orc war chiefs of the Forgotten Realms, and he is the most famous orc chief in the history of the D&D game.

Smarter and more intuitive than most of his kind, Obould slew his chieftain to take control of his tribe. Skilled in the arts of war and renowned for his violent temper, Obould proved himself a fierce opponent in battle time and again. Over the years, he subsumed other orc tribes into his own, until he commanded a horde of thousands.

Obould leveraged his strength and influence to carve out a kingdom for himself in the Spine of the World, a mountain range overlooking numerous dwarven, human, and elven strongholds.

After years of bloody conflict with his more civilized neighbors, Obould did the unthinkable and brokered a peace treaty with his enemies. This treaty confused many of the orcs under Obould's command. It was either a clever ploy by Obould to buy time while he strengthened his army for a final, decisive sweep across the Savage Frontier, or it was a troubling sign that Obould had forsaken the ways of Gruumsh and needed to be destroyed.

***Orcs.*** Orcs are savage raiders and pillagers with stooped postures, low foreheads, and piggish faces with prominent lower canines that resemble tusks.

***Gruumsh One-Eye.***  Orcs worship Gruumsh, the mightiest of the orc deities and their creator. The orcs believe that in ancient days, the gods gathered to divide the world among their followers. When Gruumsh claimed the mountains, he learned they had been taken by the dwarves. He laid claim to the forests, but those had been settled by the elves. Each place that Gruumsh wanted had already been claimed. The other gods laughed at Gruumsh, but he responded with a furious bellow. Grasping his mighty spear, he laid waste to the mountains, set the forests aflame, and carved great furrows in the fields. Such was the role of the orcs, he proclaimed, to take and destroy all that the other races would deny them. To this day, the orcs wage an endless war on humans, elves, dwarves, and other folk.

Orcs hold a particular hatred for elves. The elven god Corellon Larethian half-blinded Gruumsh with a well-placed arrow to the orc god's eye. Since then, the orcs have taken particular joy in slaughtering elves. Turning his injury into a baleful gift, Gruumsh grants divine might to any champion who willingly plucks out one of its eyes in his honor.

***Tribes like Plagues.*** Orcs gather in tribes that exert their dominance and satisfy their bloodlust by plundering villages, devouring or driving off roaming herds, and slaying any humanoids that stand against them. After savaging a settlement, orcs pick it clean of wealth and items usable in their own lands. They set the remains of villages and camps ablaze, then retreat whence they came, their bloodlust satisfied.

When an existing territory is depleted of food, an orc tribe divides into roving bands that scout for choice hunting grounds. When each party returns, it brings back trophies and news of targets ripe for attack, the richest of which is chosen. The tribe then sets out en masse to carve a bloody path to its new territory.

On rare occasions, a tribe's leader chooses to hold onto a particularly defensible lair for decades. The orcs of such a tribe must range far across the countryside to sate their appetites.

Strength and power are the greatest of orcish virtues, and orcs embrace all manner of mighty creatures in their tribes. Rejecting notions of racial purity, they proudly welcome ogres, trolls, half-orcs, and orogs into their ranks. As well, orcs respect and fear the size and power of evil giants, and often serve them as guards and soldiers.

***Ranging Scavengers.***  Their lust for slaughter demands that orcs dwell always within striking distance of new targets. As such, they seldom settle permanently, instead converting ruins, cavern complexes, and defeated foes' villages into fortified camps and strongholds. Orcs build only for defense, making no innovation or improvement to their lairs beyond mounting the severed body parts of their victims on spiked stockade walls or pikes jutting up from moats and trenches.

***Leadership and Might.***  Orc tribes are mostly patriarchal, flaunting such vivid or grotesque titles as Many-Arrows, Screaming Eye, and Elf Ripper. Occasionally, a powerful war chief unites scattered orc tribes into a single rampaging horde, which runs roughshod over other orc tribes and humanoid settlements from a position of overwhelming strength.

***Orc Crossbreeds.***  Luthic, the orc goddess of fertility and wife of Gruumsh, demands that orcs procreate often and indiscriminately so that orc hordes swell generation after generation. The orcs' drive to reproduce runs stronger than any other humanoid race, and they readily crossbreed with other races. When an orc procreates with a non-orc humanoid of similar size and stature (such as a human or a dwarf), the resulting child is either an orc or a half-orc. When an orc produces young with an ogre, the child is a half-ogre of intimidating strength and brutish features called an ogrillon.

## Oregg Steeltwister

This orc, the only sorcerer in the White Tusk clan, is Bonebreaker Dorokor's lieutenant and master of discipline. He does not fully understand Dorokor's schemes and games of diplomacy, but follows her instructions dutifully, hoping one day to win not just her favor, but also her heart.

When Dorokor is not around, he grumbles about keeping the human boy Edmund hostage, and resents Dorokor's gentle treatment of the boy. He longs to be free of Castle Rend and to face the bounty hunters tracking their clan head-on. At least then he and his people could die gloriously in battle, rather than living a dreary life within stone walls.

As master of discipline, Oregg's favorite way to get an orc to behave or torture prisoners is to lock them in their own armor and cast heat metal to sear their flesh. He has practiced this spell for years, bartering with the druids of other orc tribes to unlock its magical secrets.

## Orog

Orogs are orcs blessed with a surprisingly keen intellect that ordinary orcs believe is a gift from the orc goddess Luthic. Like Luthic, orogs prefer to live underground, although the scarcity of food often brings them to the surface to hunt. Orcs respect an orog's strength and cunning, and a lone orog might command an orc war band.

***Stronger and Smarter.*** An orog uses its strength to bully other orcs and its intelligence to surprise enemies on the battlefield. Many an overconfident elf, human, or dwarf commander has watched a "simple" orc warlord execute a clever maneuver to outflank and destroy an opposing force, not realizing the orc is an orog.

When encountered in great numbers, orogs form their own detachments within much larger orc hordes, and they are always at the forefront of any attack, relying on their superior strength and tactical insight to overcome anything that stands in their way.

Few orc tribes actively seek out orogs to bolster their ranks. The orogs' superiority makes them ideal leaders, and thus deadly rivals to orc war chiefs, who must be wary of orog treachery.

***Detached Killers.*** Wanting nothing more than to hack their enemies to pieces, orogs are a terrifying presence on the battlefield. They form no attachments, even to their parents and siblings, and have no concept of love or dedication. They worship the orc pantheon of gods-Gruumsh and Luthic foremost-because they believe that the gods have strength beyond reason, and physical might is all they respect.

***Servants of Darkness.*** Mistrusted by orcs, some orogs form independent mercenary war bands that sell themselves to the highest bidder. As long as they are rewarded, orog mercenaries gladly serve as elite warriors and shock troops for evil wizards, depraved giants, and other villains.

***Orcs.*** Orcs are savage raiders and pillagers with stooped postures, low foreheads, and piggish faces with prominent lower canines that resemble tusks.

***Gruumsh One-Eye.***  Orcs worship Gruumsh, the mightiest of the orc deities and their creator. The orcs believe that in ancient days, the gods gathered to divide the world among their followers. When Gruumsh claimed the mountains, he learned they had been taken by the dwarves. He laid claim to the forests, but those had been settled by the elves. Each place that Gruumsh wanted had already been claimed. The other gods laughed at Gruumsh, but he responded with a furious bellow. Grasping his mighty spear, he laid waste to the mountains, set the forests aflame, and carved great furrows in the fields. Such was the role of the orcs, he proclaimed, to take and destroy all that the other races would deny them. To this day, the orcs wage an endless war on humans, elves, dwarves, and other folk.

Orcs hold a particular hatred for elves. The elven god Corellon Larethian half-blinded Gruumsh with a well-placed arrow to the orc god's eye. Since then, the orcs have taken particular joy in slaughtering elves. Turning his injury into a baleful gift, Gruumsh grants divine might to any champion who willingly plucks out one of its eyes in his honor.

***Tribes like Plagues.*** Orcs gather in tribes that exert their dominance and satisfy their bloodlust by plundering villages, devouring or driving off roaming herds, and slaying any humanoids that stand against them. After savaging a settlement, orcs pick it clean of wealth and items usable in their own lands. They set the remains of villages and camps ablaze, then retreat whence they came, their bloodlust satisfied.

When an existing territory is depleted of food, an orc tribe divides into roving bands that scout for choice hunting grounds. When each party returns, it brings back trophies and news of targets ripe for attack, the richest of which is chosen. The tribe then sets out en masse to carve a bloody path to its new territory.

On rare occasions, a tribe's leader chooses to hold onto a particularly defensible lair for decades. The orcs of such a tribe must range far across the countryside to sate their appetites.

Strength and power are the greatest of orcish virtues, and orcs embrace all manner of mighty creatures in their tribes. Rejecting notions of racial purity, they proudly welcome ogres, trolls, half-orcs, and orogs into their ranks. As well, orcs respect and fear the size and power of evil giants, and often serve them as guards and soldiers.

***Ranging Scavengers.***  Their lust for slaughter demands that orcs dwell always within striking distance of new targets. As such, they seldom settle permanently, instead converting ruins, cavern complexes, and defeated foes' villages into fortified camps and strongholds. Orcs build only for defense, making no innovation or improvement to their lairs beyond mounting the severed body parts of their victims on spiked stockade walls or pikes jutting up from moats and trenches.

***Leadership and Might.***  Orc tribes are mostly patriarchal, flaunting such vivid or grotesque titles as Many-Arrows, Screaming Eye, and Elf Ripper. Occasionally, a powerful war chief unites scattered orc tribes into a single rampaging horde, which runs roughshod over other orc tribes and humanoid settlements from a position of overwhelming strength.

***Orc Crossbreeds.***  Luthic, the orc goddess of fertility and wife of Gruumsh, demands that orcs procreate often and indiscriminately so that orc hordes swell generation after generation. The orcs' drive to reproduce runs stronger than any other humanoid race, and they readily crossbreed with other races. When an orc procreates with a non-orc humanoid of similar size and stature (such as a human or a dwarf), the resulting child is either an orc or a half-orc. When an orc produces young with an ogre, the child is a half-ogre of intimidating strength and brutish features called an ogrillon.

## Orog Warlord of Luthic

This menacing orog is a cunning battle tactician and skilled warrior favored by the Cave Mother. In combat, it wields a pike with deadly skill, terrifies enemies, and inspires its wounded allies into a blood frenzy.

The orog warlord will either be the chieftain of an orc tribe or an outcast leader that leads a ragtag lot of humanoid and giant mercenaries.

## Ravager Slaughter Lord

Whether driven by resentment for being shunned by the fairer folk, or consumed by the burning fury that still drives them since the corruption of the Ruiner's blood in the Calamity, most orcs are a chaotic force of destruction. They are a threat to civilization, to be sure, but more a mindless force of nature than a coordinated menace.

However, with each generation, some orcs grow smarter: more organized, learning from their foes, and understanding the might in well-led numbers. This growing horde of calculating, ruthless murder is known as the Ravagers, and with each defeat, they learn. And grow stronger still.

Nearly every orc tribe of the Dividing Plains has joined the Ravagers, and most do so willingly. Orc warchiefs, hungry for recognition in the single burning eye of their god, turn to the Ravagers as a way to fight greater battles, kill stronger foes, and win bloodier spoils. The few war chiefs whose deeds live up to their ambitions soon find themselves leading an arm of the Ravagers—and honored by the title of Slaughter Lord. A Slaughter Lord craves combat like it craves food, and leads Ravager raids as often as possible, but is frequently forced to remain at its stronghold because of its strict regimen of alchemical treatments.

A small army of shamans and alchemists attend to the Slaughter Lords in order to artificially enhance their already-tremendous strength. The blessings and concoctions crafted by the orc-lords' lackeys grow their muscular forms to mountainous size, sharpen their tactical reasoning, and bestow upon them the divine protection of the One-Eyed Ruiner. While their unnatural size is a Slaughter Lord's most obvious martial advantage—it dual-wields weapons most humans could only wield with two hands—the Ruiner's blessings grant it tremendous divine magic. Rumors abound of brave warriors being slain or blinded by a single guttural utterance.

The people of the Dividing Plains do not know exactly how many Slaughter Lords command the Ravagers. Some reason that there are four major arms of the barbarian horde, and that each arm is commanded by one of these monsters. Inside the walls of the margrave of Westruun's keep, however, Margrave Zimmerset and his councilors worry over a graver matter: the Ravagers are too well-organized to be led by war-crazed, drug-addled orcs. Who, or what, is commanding the Slaughter Lords from the shadows?

## White Tusk Bloodrager

Bloodragers of the White Tusk clan practice the art of death and express their mastery with precise strokes of their dual falchions. They are the most disciplined orcs in the White Tusk clan, and train daily with Bonebreaker Dorokor to hone their Skills.

Through constant training, orcish bloodragers have developed a state of pure focus. In this cold fury, their sword strokes rend flesh with preternatural ease and their powerful bodies simply refuse to die.

## White Tusk Juggernaut

The White Tusk orc clan named itself after its hulking warriors who, in addition to their massive bodies, possessed enormous white tusks. White Tusk juggernauts pride themselves not just in their battle prowess but also in the size and sharpness of their monstrous lower canines. Some juggernauts have their tusks pierced and display fearsome jewelry from their teeth, others decorate them with ink or paint, and those who can withstand the pain even have symbols or runes inscribed upon them.

A juggernaut's immense muscles allow them to wield oversized weapons worthy of their bloodlust, and they wear thick metal armor forged together in piecemeal from bits of plate armor scavenged from the corpses of their more knightly victims.

## White Tusk Orc

The rank and file of the White Tusk clan pride themselves on being larger and, thanks to Bonebreaker Dorokor's leadership since the investiture of Castle Rend, more devastating in combat than normal orcs.

They are a chaotic evil tribe who care only for strength and the subjugation of their enemies. They delight in cruelty. But Bonebreaker Dorokor is lawful, and has led them to triumph over the humanoids of the forest. So they obey her...for now.

## White Tusk Shaman

Most orc clans keep a shaman or two around to interpret the will of the natural world. These shamans enjoy a high status in their clan, even when a tribe such as the White Tusks possess warspeakers who manifest the will of the gods, for there are more powers in this world than that of the gods. The Mundane World itself possesses a sort of consciousness—the whispering of the wind, the babbling of running water, and the quiet grumbling of the mountains; these small gestures of nature are the world speaking to those who possess the skill to listen.

As part of their training, orcish shamans bond with a single animal, typically a dire wolf. When that animal dies, as all things must, the shaman takes that animal's spirit into their own body to make their bond eternal. A spirit-bonded shaman can take the shape of their bonded animal.

## White Tusk Warspeaker

Priests of Grole, orcish god of war and slaughter, live for the chance to kill in the name of their bloodstained god. Dressed in war-robes of scavenged leather and mail, these priests bestow the blessing of pain upon their allies, goading them to die gloriously in combat in the name of Grole.

Warspeakers seek conflict constantly, flying into a frothing rage at the slightest provocation. When their clan is at peace, they scheme and search for ways to trick or coerce their chieftain into attacking—and if they cannot, they scheme against their chieftain and convince a more aggressive orc into supplanting their "soft, peace-loving" leader.

## Yagra Stonefist

Yagra is a Black Network mercenary who gets paid to protect a Zhent negotiator named Davil Starsong (see appendix B for more information on him). Yagra finds the job boring and likes to pass the time by challenging adventurers to arm wrestle. (Resolve such contests using contested Strength checks.) If the characters express their opposition to the Xanathar Guild, Yagra might urge them to speak to Davil about joining forces with the Zhentarim to destroy the beholder crime lord.

## Zarak

Zarak is an assassin without honor or conscience. Unusually short of stature for someone of orcish heritage, he might pass for an ugly, beardless dwarf were it not for his rotting tusks and grayish pallor. The only thing he loves is money, and he wouldn't hesitate to stab allies in the back if they came between him and the riches he covets.

## Ziraj the Hunter

Ziraj is a half-orc hunter who wields an oversized bow that shoots correspondingly large arrows. He is the Master of Assassination for the Black Network. If Ziraj sets out to kill someone, it's because one of his friends (Davil, Istrid, Skeemo, or Tashlyn) asked him to. The characters might become Ziraj's prey, or Ziraj might come to their aid to eliminate a common enemy. He's the strong, silent type.

The City Watch has received reports of a figure who haunts the rooftops of Waterdeep-a hulking shadow that glares from its perch, rains down death in the form of long black arrows, and slinks off without so much as a whisper. Where he comes from-if he even has a home-remains a mystery, as does the question of where he might show up next.

***Treasure.*** Ziraj wears +2 leather armor and carries an oversized longbow. This unique weapon can be used only by a Medium or larger creature that has a Strength of 18 or higher. The bow shoots oversized arrows that deal piercing damage equal to 2d6 + the wielder's Strength modifier. Its range is the same as an ordinary longbow.

***The Doom Raiders.*** The Doom Raiders were five unscrupulous adventurers who liked to plunder lich lairs (called "dooms" by some). They gave up adventuring to join the Black Network and came to Waterdeep three years ago with plans to establish a Zhentarim foothold in the city. In that time, they have forged alliances with various nobles and guilds and run afoul of others, all the while fending off Harper spies.
