## Alchemist Archer

*Hidden in the dappled shadows of the tree's leaves, the elf 's leather bandolier jingles softly. Leather armor dyed to match its surroundings, the nearly invisible archer removes a vial from the bandolier, quickly attaching it to an arrow. The well-kept bow does not creak as the bowstring is drawn.*

Mixing their knowledge of dangerous chemicals with their extensive weapon skills, these elves are devastating from afar.

***A Sharp Smell.*** Try as they might, alchemist archer elves cannot eliminate the scent of their various acids and tinctures. Their distinctive scent makes them easier to find by creatures with an acute sense of smell.

## Bar Brawl

*An enraged mass of malcontents storms across the tavern, overturning tables, busting bottles, and browbeating innocent patrons.*

The jovial peace of a drinking establishment can transform into a whirlwind of chaos and violence in a mere moment, and no one caught in the middle of a bar brawl can hope to evade it.

***Mob Brutality.*** A bar brawl arises suddenly and violently, often after a vile insult is lobbed or an accusation of cheating is lodged. Once enraged, the bar brawl attacks indiscriminately, assailing both the faultless and offending patrons with whatever weapons readily come to hand.

## Battle Mage

Battle mages are open vessels through which arcane energy pours raw, unfettered, and without regard for self-preservation. The art of the battle mage takes as much practice as any other type of spellcasting—perhaps more so. Many nations count battle mages among their ranks, with most establishing and maintaining an elite college or academy to properly train these living weapons. Just as much time goes into indoctrinating the battle mages into the patriotic beliefs as in the magic itself, for no group wants a powerful weapon turned against its creator.

>
>### Actions
>***Multiattack.*** The bearfolk makes two attacks with its battleaxe and one with its bite.  
>
>***Battleaxe.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 14 (2d8 + 5) slashing damage, or 16 (2d10 + 5) slashing damage if used two-handed.

>
>***Leadership (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).*** For 1 minute, the bearfolk chieftain can, as a reaction, utter a special command or warning whenever a nonhostile creature that it can see within 30 feet of it makes an attack roll or a saving throw. The creature can add a d4 to its roll, provided it can hear and understand the bearfolk chieftain. A creature can benefit from only one Leadership die at a time. This effect ends if the bearfolk chieftain is incapacitated.

## Bearfolk Chieftain

*With white fur and a sturdy ax, bearfolk chieftains use their size and appearance to threaten strangers. Those who show courage are often welcomed to join the tribe around a fire and feast on seal meat.*

***Balanced Strength.*** Ruling even a small clan of bearfolk requires patience, sagacity, and ferocity in equal measure, and chieftains who last more than a season display mastery of such a balance. What tales the skalds do not tell of their deeds can be read in their scars, which they display with pride. Always flanked by loyal guards willing to enforce their will, bearfolk chieftains must nonetheless remain ready to wade into battle at a moment's notice against the horrors that lurk in their frozen wilderness or the challenges of their would-be successors.

***Axe of Rulership.*** Each chieftain owns (and often wields) an axe of some kind as a totem of rulership. Stealing a bearfolk chieftain's axe is a crime that usually results in death or exile.

> ##### Bearfolk in Midgard
>In the Midgard setting, bearfolk are rare but respected. They thrive both in the Northlands and in the Shadow Realm, where many of a chieftain's strongest guards (often referred to by their northern name, "huskarls") are expected to go on seasonal rambles over wide territory. Their fondness for wandering and their honest nature makes them natural friends to the dwarves and humans against giants and ogres.

## Black Sun Orc

*Pale-skinned and strong as an ox, the Black Sun orcs worship strength and violence and feast on the cracked bones of their enemies.*

***Hidden by the Earth.*** Black Sun orcs excel at concealing their deeds from those on the surface world, lying in wait at night to abduct victims from the roads or their homes in near complete silence. The orcs bundle off such unfortunates to the concealed caverns leading to their homes beneath the earth, where they hand the captives over to their priestesses for sacrifice.

***Nocturnal Attacks.*** Black Sun orcs are strictly nocturnal, avoiding the eye of the sun in favor of raids under moonlight—and even these do not take place during the full moon.

***Foes of Trolls and Goblins.*** Trolls, trollkin, and goblins find the fish-bellied coloration and peculiar speech of Black Sun orcs hilarious and mock them mercilessly. In most cases, this ends in a fight with one side or the other driven away.

## Black Sun Priestess

*With a fondness for cracking open ribcages and pulling out beating hearts, Black Sun priestesses are always on the lookout for the next sacrifice to their blasphemous gods.*

With her devotion painted in blood across her breast and her eyes alight with fervor for her dark faith, the Black Sun priestess embraces her cruel duties with relish.

***Front Line Fighter.*** Urging her people on to night raids for slaughter and glory, she wades into the fray alongside them as they leave little more than cracked, burnt bones in their wake. With her greatclub flecked with dried blood and her face painted white as a skull, she cuts a fearsome figure for a fearsome faith.

It can expose a fresh cut to a source of disease or poison and safely absorb the dormant affliction into its blood stream. It can then inflict the disease or poison on another by spitting a stream of blood at the creature. On a successful hit as a ranged spell attack, the target is exposed to the disease or poison and must proceed with whatever saving throws are required.

Once the blood mage has consumed a creature's blood in this way, the same creature's blood will never again produce a memory for that blood mage.

>***Blood Feast (Recharge 5–6).*** The blood mage drains life-giving blood from nearby creatures. Each creature within 20 feet of the blood mage must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 35 (10d6) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The blood mage gains temporary hp equal to the single highest amount of necrotic damage dealt. A creature that doesn't have blood is immune to Blood Feast.

## Blood Mage

Favoring linen robes of crimson or black to hide the stains and spatters of its medium, a blood mage about its work might look like a beggar and smell like an abattoir, but the power coursing through its veins makes such concerns beneath the blood mage's notice. Drawing power from bloodletting, both its own and that of others, makes most civilizations fear and despise the blood mage, necessitating that it practice its dark arts in secret. Each period of renewed study is usually accompanied by disappearances among the most vulnerable. A trail of exsanguinated corpses follows.

Drawing power from bloodletting, both its own and that of others, makes most civilizations fear and despise the blood mage, necessitating that it practice its dark arts in secret. Each period of renewed study is usually accompanied by disappearances among the most vulnerable. A trail of exsanguinated corpses follows.

> ##### Blood Mages in Midgard
>Practiced openly in the Blood Kingdom of Morgau and tolerated in the Mharoti dragon empire, blood magic is a common threat in Midgard's darker lands. Blood mages are often found allied with or creating **crimson tusked ogres** (see page 279) and **blood zombies** (see page 393), and are on good terms with most vampires, liches, and followers of Marena, the Red Goddess. When using the Midgard setting, change the blood mage's spells to the following (see "Fifth Edition Appendix" in the Midgard World Book):
>
>Cantrips (at will): *acid splash*, blood tide*, *mage hand*, *mending*, *prestidigitation*

## Chaos-spawn Goblin

*This stunted creature, wrapped almost entirely in the remnants of a cloak, has the face of an emaciated goblin. Its tiny hole of a mouth looks incapable of speech, and its glazed eyes stare at nothing.*

***Warped by the Unknowable.*** These creatures were once goblins, still retaining their general size and form, but long exposure to the psyche-obliterating presence of Great Old Ones has warped them in a variety of ways. They no longer speak aloud but communicate telepathically in images. Chaos-spawn goblins no longer eat as they once did, receiving all of their sustenance from the star-born creatures they now serve.

***Single-minded Servants.*** Raiding and taking captives still occupies much of the chaos-spawn's time, but now their captives are placed inside organic pods or orifices of various kinds which grow in the ground below their masters' feet in web-like structures. There, the Great Old Ones drain whatever it is they wish from the captives, who leave nothing but a gel-like substance behind. This substance is what sustains the chaosspawn goblins, which they take in through feeding tubes.

***Loyal Servants.*** In their hunts for captives, they do not hesitate to prey on goblins. For this reason, and out of sheer terror, other goblins avoid the chaos-spawn as much as they are able. Indeed, the areas chaos-spawn inhabit are often barren of other intelligent life.

## Cleric of the Brew

Dwarves love their beer, so it is no surprise that many of them revere the goddess of beer. Clerics of the brew are talented brewers, creating delicious full-flavored mundane ales, but they can also channel the power of the goddess to make special "blessed" brews to aid her followers. They are capable fighters and are often found in the front ranks of dwarven war bands, swinging their maces and inspiring their comrades.

> ##### Clerics of the Brew in Midgard
>The Goddess of Merriment was originally introduced to the dwarves by the wandering Kariv, who still revere her as "Mother Ale." Ninkash, patron of brewers and tavern keepers, is widely beloved among both dwarves and humans and worshipped from the heights of the dwarven cantons to the desert cities of the Southlands. When someone dozes off after a bout of drinking, he or she is said to have "gone to visit Ninkash. " Her clerics, known as the vaer, act as trusted advisers to their communities, and many are empowered with the divine domain of Beer (see Midgard Heroes Handbook).

>***Object Reading.*** By concentrating for 10 minutes on a specific object, a corpse thief learns more about the object's most recent owner. The effects of this trait are different depending on if the most recent owner is alive or dead. This trait only works once per object.  
>- If the most recent owner is alive, the corpse thief sees through that person's eyes for 10 minutes. This works like the clairvoyance spell, except the most recent owner is the sensor and controls which direction it is pointed, how far it can see, etc. The most recent owner must make a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw. On a success, it gets the sensation that it is being watched.
>- If the most recent owner is dead, the corpse thief can learn five things about the person's life through dream-like visions and emotions. This works like the speak with dead spell, except the spirit can only answer questions about events in which the object was present.

>***Claw.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 5 (1d4 + 3) piercing damage.  
>
>***Steal.*** The corpse thief targets one creature within 5 feet of it and attempts to steal one small item. The target must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or lose one non-weapon, non-armor object that is small enough to fit in one hand.

## Corpse Thief

*This thin, androgynous creature stands with a noticeable hunch. Its skin is patchy and discolored, and it wears dozens of trinkets on strings around its neck and shoulders.*

Unable to feel strong emotion naturally, corpse thieves steal objects from other humanoids, reliving sensations tied to those possessions in an attempt to find some feeling of belonging.

***Object Reading.*** By holding certain objects, a corpse thief can learn about the item's previous owner. It feels the sensations and emotions tied to the object, and such experiences are usually the only strong feelings it ever experiences in its life. The creature gets its name from its tendency to loot graves for such trinkets, although it is also adept at stealing them in the chaos of a battle.

***Alien Minds.*** Corpse thieves cannot feel strong emotions such as joy, anger, and love without reading it on an object. They have a weak sense of personal identity, often confusing memories gained through stolen items with their own. A corpse thief that steals too many objects from one individual may start to believe it is that person. Always seeking emotional connection but forever unable to attain it, corpse thieves live in small communities on the edges of humanoid settlements in mock semblances of those humanoids' societies.

***Unflattering Legends.*** In addition to the unfortunate name others have bestowed upon them, corpse thieves find themselves associated with several ugly myths. Some claim a corpse thief 's discolored patches of skin come from the flesh of humanoid corpses sewn onto its body. Others believe the creatures sometimes disguise themselves as recently deceased humanoids. If somebody makes a miraculous recovery from illness but acts strangely afterward, people may believe the individual is really a corpse thief in disguise.

## Dark Eye

*This pale-skinned humanoid is swathed in dark robes. Beneath its hood, its face is a grotesque mask. Smooth, featureless flesh is where one eye would be; the existing eye is a black pit that swallows both light and hope.*

Dark folk arose when a line of human wizards swore allegiance to shadow gods and passed this shadow power to their children. Easily mistaken for humans at a glance, the dark folk long ago diverged from their ancestors.

Some dark folk carry a stronger measure of shadow in their souls, and it grants them the gift of sight, at the cost of one of their eyes. Staring into that eye threatens to draw the viewer in to its doom.

***Shadows among Light.*** Dark folk most often live near humanoid settlements. They worship the powers of darkness and shadow in secret, spreading their corruption in the dead of night and in darkened cellars. They often work nocturnal jobs as undertakers, night soil collectors, alchemists, or night watchmen, escaping the unrelenting glare of the sun.

***Darkened Blood.*** Sometimes a family line carries the tiniest seed of darkness, and a dark folk is born. These pale children face difficult lives, often singled out and shunned by peers for the dark nature they can't ever fully hide. Though most dark folk look human, dark folk can descend from any humanoid (though they lose all traits associated with their heritage).

## Dark Servant

*This figure is dressed in black robes, and every part of its body that isn't covered by robes is wrapped in gray bandages. It wields blood‑stained sickles in each bandaged hand and moves with menace.*

Dark folk arose when a line of human wizards swore allegiance to shadow gods and passed this shadow power to their children. Easily mistaken for humans at a glance, the dark folk long ago diverged from their ancestors.

The lowliest of the dark folk, the dark servants are also the most numerous. They cover their skin completely to shield it from even a single mote of light. Dark servants are without empathy and prefer the company of other dark folk. Murderous and cruel, they have difficulty interacting with non‑dark folk for long.

***Shadows among Light.*** Dark folk most often live near humanoid settlements. They worship the powers of darkness and shadow in secret, spreading their corruption in the dead of night and in darkened cellars.

The area within 30 feet of the dark voice becomes dimly lit until the end of the dark voice's next turn. Only sunlight can illuminate the area brightly during this time. Each non-dark folk creature in the area must succeed on a DC 15 Charisma saving throw or take 13 (3d8) psychic damage and be frightened until the start of its next turn.

## Dark Voice

*Shadows cling to the black chainmail draping this humanoid's form. Black cloth binds its eyes tightly, but it turns its face as if it can see. The figure's frost-rimmed mace leaves wisps of vapor in the air as the whispering begins, and the light starts to die.*

Dark folk arose when a line of human wizards swore allegiance to shadow gods and passed this shadow power to their children. Easily mistaken for humans at a glance, the dark folk long ago diverged from their ancestors.

The most powerful of the dark folk, a dark voice sacrifices both eyes to the truth lurking in the shadows. All dark folk instantly recognize the power and authority vested within a dark voice, though hearing two voices leads to bitter rivalry. Either the local dark folk turn on one another until only one voice remains, or the weaker dark voice sets off to establish a splinter group.

In the rare case that multiple dark voices work together, the dark folk become a terrifying force. A dark voice commands the essence of darkness itself, whispering secrets that snuff light and fill listeners with terror so profound it can be deadly.

## Deathsworn

*The elf mutters softly to itself as it nocks an arrow in its ancient bow. In one fluid motion, the elf releases the arrow, blossoming with green fire, and leaps from cover, its blade striking a hair's breadth after its arrow.*

A deathsworn elf is one of the elite soldiers of the elvish empire, sworn to the service of the elvish war god. Its speedy archery, swift and silent travel, and masterful ambushes make it feared and respected by all its foes. Many claim the title, but few deathsworn still walk the mortal world; most have retreated to their fey realms to fight against darkness elsewhere.

***Bow Speech.*** Deathsworn have a reverence (some would say obsession) with their tools, in particular, their bows and arrows. They often wield particularly ancient, named heirloom weapons or those made by divine hands and given to elves—and they speak to their bows as if the makers or other spirits inhabit the weapons. This is quite disconcerting to other archers, as a deathsworn seems half-mad when most focused on its aim.

***Keen Eyed.*** Deathsworn have an incredible knack for noticing precise details at a distance; the exact number of soldiers marching down a valley, the height of a palisade, or the speed of a current all seem to spring to their eyes. Others occasionally find their propensity to share this information a touch grating.

> ##### Deathsworn in Midgard
>The deathsworn are the elite soldiers of Valeresh, the elvish god of war and justice, and were a foundation of elvish power. Most are believed to have returned to the Summer Lands, though they are occasionally found in the Arbonesse, Margreve, Gennecka, or other ancient forests. Widely referred to as "Valeran Deathsworn," they are feared by all reasonable mercenaries and soldiers of other nations.

## Dhampir

*A lithe being of dark beauty appears human, though its movements, intensity, and charm are so powerful and coordinated it seems almost supernatural.*

Dhampirs are the half-living children of vampires and living mothers, born into a world that fears and rejects them. Thanks to their human-like appearance, many dhampirs hide in plain sight, spending their lives concealing their identities.

***Blood Ties.*** For most dhampirs, their mother's family is all they have since even those who do not know of a dhampir's true nature are generally put off by their supernatural presence. As a result, families with a dhampir withdraw from the world, becoming reclusive. Most dhampirs strike out on their own when they mature to spare their families further burden, but the half-living remember what their loved ones sacrificed. Dhampirs will return to aid their families at a moment's notice.

***Inner Darkness.*** For most dhampirs, their mother's family is all they have since even those who do not know of a dhampir's true nature are generally put off by their supernatural presence.

The creature can add a d4 to its roll provided it can hear and understand the dhampir. A creature can benefit from only one Leadership die at a time. This effect ends if the dhampir is incapacitated.

## Dhampir Commander

*The thin, dark-haired commander wades into the throng of enemy soldiers. The leader's troops come rushing in, inspired by the courageous example.*

Dhampirs in military service fly up the ranks and use their natural charisma to inspire the soldiers beneath them to acts of heroism and violence.

***Inspiring Leaders.*** Dhampir commanders lead by example on the battlefield, wading into combat and leading charges. A dhampir's troops die for their leader and offer their own necks for feeding if the commander is injured. Good dhampirs rely on this loyalty to fight malevolent forces, while evil half-living commanders relish the power they have over soldiers, pushing them to acts of depravity.

## Doomspeaker

The only creatures more vile than demons—creatures born irredeemably evil—are those who willingly adopt a demon's cruel ways. Worst among the demon worshipers are the fallen paladins known as doomspeakers, warriors so ensorcelled by power that they would burn the world just to rule its ashes. These creatures walk the path of evil not by birth but by choice, and they breed cruelty in their hearts so dark that no glimmer of compassion can pierce it. Doomspeakers raise vast hordes of weak-minded and rage-fueled followers to run roughshod over the world. Empowered by their leader's evil magic, such legions can trample even mighty armies into the mud.

> ##### Doomspeakers in Midgard
>In the Southlands, doomspeakers recruit many of the gnolls of the Sarkland Desert to their cause. The gnolls are drawn by the doomspeakers' strength and the thought of easy conquest. Doomspeakers have a hidden complex in the south that serves as their main base of operations and the resting place of the Book of Nine Dooms, a book containing magic that uses raw, violent emotion as fuel. They also maintain a presence on the Rothenian Plain, both in caves under Demon Mountain by permission of its Master and in the forests north of the plain. When using the Midgard setting, change the doomspeaker's spells to the following (see "Fifth Edition Appendix" in the Midgard World Book)

The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.  
>
>### Reactions
>***Parry.*** The dust goblin chieftain adds 2 to its AC against one melee attack that would hit it. To do so, the chieftain must see the attacker and be wielding a melee weapon.

## Dust Goblin Chieftain

*At first, the strange eyes and gibbering might make the dust goblin seem addled or at least a less-than-formidable foe. But its mastery of command words and bizarre ancient rituals makes these small creatures extremely dangerous, able to call on powers older than human history.*

A dust goblin chieftain must keep its tribe alive and fed, which is no small accomplishment in the wastelands it calls home. The chieftain has an edge on its fellows, which helps it keep the others in line, and that edge takes the form of a beneficial mutation brought on by the energies which permeate its homelands.

***Mastery of Ancient Languages.*** Dust goblin chieftains are often surprisingly learned in ancient tongues, able to speak and command creatures of the outer void, the hells, or from tombs long forgotten. Their ability to decipher scripts and faded text is unmatched.

***Strange Technology and Oddly Arcane Items.*** Thanks to the ruined civilizations which came before and in whose ruins the dust goblins live, a chieftain has access to a wide variety of unexpected items and magic. The exact nature of these items varies from chieftain to chieftain and is up to the GM's discretion.

## Edjet

*Born into war, the edjet are proud of their scars, their cracked scales, their trophies taken from the hairy races, and the plunder they have rendered to the great dragon lords. They are a proud few and with good reason.*

***Troops of Dragon Armies.*** The classic edjet are heavy troops of dragonborn devoted to one or another of the elemental gods and commanded by paladins or priests. Their general is typically a lesser dragon or major drake, and their units include any number of holy warriors and elementalists, as well as heavily armored lizard-riders, and even oliphaunt-riding artillerists. Their rank and file consist of halberdiers, feared as much for their prowess as for their ability to breathe gouts of flame into their enemy's front line.

***Dragons Above All.*** The edjet are raised from birth to believe in the superiority of the scaled folk over all others, and their confidence shows on the battlefield. Their charges are swift and crushing, and they fight with a zeal rarely seen elsewhere. The edjet are believers, and this gives them courage to stand tall against giants, magic, or even gods.

>Most dragonborn resent this, of course. Like any other people, they are not inclined toward evil or good—but those within the Dragon Empire are subject to the sultan's dreams of conquest. Because the Dragon Empire holds scalykind above all other races, intelligent creatures like true dragons, dragonborn, and half‑dragons—even kobolds—receive superior education and martial training to the rest of the empire's peoples.

>These dragonkin often go on to become officers in the Dragon Empire's mighty legions, desiring to amass even more power for themselves by conquering Midgard and the Southlands. Dragonborn elementalists and light cavalry are part of the Dragon Empire's akinji military caste. In peacetime, the akinji are its landholders, merchants, priests, mayors, headmen, ship captains, and minor figures, filling a role similar to landed gentry elsewhere. Dragonborn heavy cavalry within the empire are part of the timarli military caste, which is comprised entirely of minor nobles, generals, and ambassadors. Many dragonborn heavy cavalry serve the sultan directly as advisors, castellans, seers, or spies.

This elemental focus grants the dragonborn resistance to a certain damage type and the ability to innately cast some spells. Its spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 13, +5 to hit with spell attacks).  
>- **Flame (Fire):** The dragonborn has resistance to fire damage. It can cast the *produce flame* cantrip at will and can cast *heat metal* or *scorching ray* three times per day.

>***War Mage.*** When making an opportunity attack, the dragonborn can cast a spell with a casting time of 1 action instead of making a weapon attack. If this spell requires a ranged attack roll, the dragonborn doesn't have disadvantage on the attack roll from being within 5 feet of a hostile creature, though it may still have disadvantage from other sources. This spell must only target the creature that provoked the opportunity attack.

## Elementalist

*A dragonborn draped in flowing robes cracks its knuckles, causing sparks of elemental magic to spray in all directions.*

Dragons carry the power of the elements in their blood, and some dragonborn also carry this supernatural gift.

***Arcane Artillerists.*** Most dragonborn elementalists are specially trained soldiers, used on the field of battle to protect their infantry and cavalry allies. Elementalists specialize in combat spells that utilize a specific element, wasting no effort on broadening their horizons with utility spells.

## Elfmarked Human

The elvish legacy lives long in its people, and the half-elven people known as the elfmarked are no different. Many try to hide their elven heritage, but their ears and the elven magic that still runs in their blood sometimes makes the deception impossible. Because of their elven blood, the elfmarked are indelibly linked to the natural magical power of the world. This link can be useful to those who train in magic, though even those elfmarked who do not train have some magical abilities. When focused properly, the elfmarked can draw upon that power to do incredible feats.

> ##### Elfmarked in Midgard
>The elfmarked humans of Midgard are attuned to the ley lines that run throughout the world. They have an easier time when trying to open or travel on shadow roads, and they are more resistant to shadow corruption (see Midgard Worldbook). However, this attunement often distracts the elfmarked as the ley lines constantly thrum with energy. Elfmarked who stray too close to a powerful ley line suffer from random headaches, nosebleeds, or worse.

Each creature in that line must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 7 (2d6) bludgeoning damage and is knocked prone. On a success, a creature takes half the damage and isn't knocked prone

## Elite Kobold

*Swift and lightly armored, the elite are archers, miners, and trap‑makers—educated and quicker than most of their fellow tribesmen.*

***Educated Mine Bosses.*** Elite kobolds are generally the claws of the king, literate, able to work out sums, keen-eyed with a sling stone, and (most of all) loyal to their tribe more than to their clutchmates. **King kobolds** take advantage of their loyalty and put them in charge of planning raids as sergeants and junior chieftains or keeping other kobolds working in the mines.

***Quick Troops.*** In war, elite kobolds fill the roles of slingers, engineers, and massed light infantry. They fight with great devotion, though often with little effect except through weight of numbers or the occasional notable success at undermining enemy walls.

The charmed target's speed is reduced to 0, it is incapacitated, and it must spend each round looking at the enchanter. While looking at the enchanter, the charmed target is considered blinded to other creatures not between it and the enchanter. The charmed target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If the charmed target takes damage from one of the enchanter's allies, it has advantage on the next saving throw. The effect also ends if the creature can no longer see or hear the enchanter. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the enchanter's Captivating Gaze for the next 24 hours.

## Enchanter

*When negotiations turned sour, the kingpin's elf stepped out of the shadows, stopping my advancing guards with a glance. His eyes are all I remember after that, though this contract says the negotiations ended well.*— Dockmaster Hayes

Masters of arcane manipulation, enchanters often make themselves indispensible to diplomats when dealing with belligerent enemies, though some enchanters seek only to empower themselves at the expense of others.

***Quietly Dangerous.*** Most enchanters conceal the true depths of their power from those around them to insinuate themselves into halls of power and to bend the wills of those who can make the world more suitable to their desires.

***Fey Diplomats.*** Enchanters are often seen as companions, lords, or wardens of other fey; they speak with unicorns, accept fealty from gnomes, sprites, **leonino**, or **fey drakes**, and sometimes conjure aerial spirits as servants, friends, or lovers. They have a knack for finding the uncanny side of the living world and are beloved by the fey lords and ladies.

Each creature must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or have disadvantage for 1 minute on any attack rolls or skill checks to take actions other than those the gnoll has ordered it to take.

## Gnoll Slaver

*With a fistful of chains and shackles and a fat money pouch, the cackling of a successful gnoll slaver is hard to mistake for anything else. They are common in slaveholding societies, though treated with respect only among their own kind.*

Occupying a strange role in a human land, gnoll slavers perform duties at which their bestial appearance and nature work to their advantage. They serve as brutal enforcers among the slave population, as captains of raiding bands, and as slave catchers, leading patrols along the land's borders in search of escapees.

***Brands, Scars, and Marks.*** Gnoll slavers have a fondness for gnawing their victims or threatening the creatures with punishments that scar and mark the victim. Branding slaves is a popular pastime among gnolls.

***Slain on Sight.*** Races near gnoll slavers tend to show no mercy towards the evil raiders; a captured slaver can expect a speedy execution and often is slain out of hand by a former slave. This merely drives gnoll slavers to some degree of caution; they prefer to operate in groups with other gnolls, and they are often the first to flee if things turn against them.

The summoned demons appear in unoccupied spaces within 50 feet of the cultist, acting immediately after the cultist in the initiative count. The demons are loyal to the cultist and follow its commands. They remain for 1 hour, until the cultist dies, or until the cultist dismisses them as a bonus action.

## Gnomish Knife Cultist

In spite of, or perhaps because of, its slight statue, a gnomish knife cultist presents an unnerving figure. Its slightly unkempt hair pokes out from beneath a hat, and it constantly fidgets and shifts on its feet. Laughter erupts from it at inopportune moments during conversations. Gnomish knife cultists are the demon wranglers of their cults, summoning and managing whatever demons the cult needs to further its goals. They often can't resist the call of demons and have been known to summon rampaging demons unbidden, leading to many interrupted harvests or market days.

>
>### Reactions
>***Brave Sacrifice.*** When an ally within 5 feet of the graveslayer is the target of an attack the graveslayer can see, the graveslayer can swap places with the ally, becoming the target instead.

## Graveslayer

Pious servants of the sun god, dwarven graveslayers belong to an elite group of undead-slaying warriors. Trained and drilled from an early age in the art of battle, these dwarves are molded into fanatical fighters against the skeletons, zombies, and worse creatures that threaten their mountain homeland. Although not full paladins, the graveslayers have blessings from the sun god that grant them the ability to channel holy power through their weapons and ensure that the undead they slay do not rise up again. The bodies of any fallen comrades are carried back home whenever possible to ensure they do not line up against the dwarves as undead opponents in the future.

> ##### Graveslayers in Midgard
>The graveslayers are active in the Black Canton of Grisal in the Ironcrags bordering the Grisal Marches of western Doresh. The dwarves battle the skeletons and zombies of Morgau, raiding across the river into the mountains and beyond to the infamous Zombie Wood. A few members of this tradition also operate out of the Wolfmark, fighting against the Morgau undead with allies from the Northlands. Graveslayers who fall in battle and are left behind often become **ghost dwarves** if Morgau's necromancers don't get to them first.

## Green Abyss Orc

*Dwelling in the eternal twilight of deep jungles and shadowy canyons, these orcs are fond of plant camouflage and are sometimes covered in armor featuring plant spikes and spines. All are expert climbers.*

***Nocturnal Menace.*** Sheltering by day in caverns just beneath the surface, the orcs of the green abyss climb up into the world with the fall of night to hunt and make war in the jungle canopy. They often align themselves with particularly bloodthirsty druids and with **vine lords** ([Tome of Beasts](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/creature/Kobold Press; Tome of Beasts.json)). They are immune to the vine lord's spore sacs and can't be transformed into tendril puppets.

***Canopy-Dwelling Predators.*** Leaner and rangier than others of their kind, they stalk among the branches, spearing their prey below with poisons harvested from the deadly plants native to their home. Their nocturnal hunting hideaways resemble those of large apes; leafy nests that are difficult to spot from the ground.

***Fierce Survivalists.*** Adept at surviving in an unforgiving world, these orcs survive through a mastery of poisons, use of simple-but-effective traps they leave for the unwary, and by snatching meals from the grip of man-eating flora. They are omnivorous and fond of devouring enormous beetles, roaches, and snakes which other humanoids would pass over.

## Heavy Cavalry

*A dragonborn knight sits astride a giant lizard like a mountain of armor and scales, draped in crimson heraldry. The knight couches its lance on its saddle and begins loading a heavy crossbow.*

***Mounted Soldier.*** Dragonborn heavy cavalry crash through the fields of war like a wall of scales and iron, breaking through enemy lines with the combined might of their lances and the weight of their giant lizard mounts. These mighty warriors also enjoy the privileges of high society as recompense for their military service, instilling most heavy cavaliers with a sort of patriotism, even if it only lasts as long as they receive their promised gold.

> ##### Dragonborn in Midgard
>For most in Midgard, speaking the word dragonborn conjures images of the Mharoti Dragon Empire. They see the armies marching across the fields of their homelands, the wyverns soaring through the skies, the fire raining down upon the earth. To them, dragonborn herald death.
>
>Most dragonborn resent this, of course. Like any other people, they are not inclined toward evil or good—but those within the Dragon Empire are subject to the sultan's dreams of conquest. Because the Dragon Empire holds scalykind above all other races, intelligent creatures like true dragons, dragonborn, and half‑dragons—even kobolds—receive superior education and martial training to the rest of the empire's peoples.
>
>These dragonkin often go on to become officers in the Dragon Empire's mighty legions, desiring to amass even more power for themselves by conquering Midgard and the Southlands. Dragonborn elementalists and light cavalry are part of the Dragon Empire's akinji military caste. In peacetime, the akinji are its landholders, merchants, priests, mayors, headmen, ship captains, and minor figures, filling a role similar to landed gentry elsewhere. Dragonborn heavy cavalry within the empire are part of the timarli military caste, which is comprised entirely of minor nobles, generals, and ambassadors. Many dragonborn heavy cavalry serve the sultan directly as advisors, castellans, seers, or spies.

>***Animate Objects (1/Day).*** The kobold casts animate objects without any components. Wisdom is its spellcasting ability.  
>
>***Junk Armor.*** As a bonus action, the kobold can create magical armor out of scrap metal and bits of junk it touches. The armor provides AC 13 + Dexterity modifier, and a critical hit scored against the kobold becomes a normal hit instead. The armor lasts until the kobold uses a bonus action to end it, the armor is removed from the kobold, or the kobold dies.  
>

>***Junk Staff.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 4 (1d4 + 2) bludgeoning damage plus 3 (1d6) fire damage.  
>
>***Flame Jet.*** *Ranged Spell Attack:* +5 to hit, range 120 ft., one target. *Hit:* 7 (2d6) fire damage. If the target is a creature or flammable object that isn't being worn or carried, it ignites. Until a creature takes an action to douse the fire, the target takes 3 (1d6) fire damage at the start of each of its turns.

## Junk Shaman

*This short, reptilian humanoid has scales of dull yellow and gleaming copper. It is swathed in filthy robes absolutely festooned with scrap metal, chains, nails, and other bits of metal and wood refuse. It carries a staff made of a length of pipe, topped with a battered candelabra that burns with hissing flames.*

Spindly even for kobolds, junk shamans weigh more than most thanks to the metal bits in which they decorate themselves.

***Fringe Oracles.*** Most other kobolds look at the junk shamans as touched but can't deny that they channel some form of divine energy. A kobold community might openly shun a junk shaman, even while every member of the warren individually seeks the shaman out for wisdom and insight.

***Treasures from Trash.*** A junk shaman eschews the normal, respectable kobold pursuits of mining, trapmaking, and sorcery. Instead, it provides an afterlife of sorts for castoff articles from kobolds and other races alike. It gathers massive collections of broken weapons, useless tools, scrap materials, and other detritus, imbuing the garbage with a semblance of life.

>

## Kapi

*Dressed in loose-fitting clothing, this lithesome monkey-like humanoid is covered from head to toe in golden fur. He wields a quarterstaff, and his long, prehensile tail twists and turns behind him, as if imbued with a life of its own.*

A kapi's fur varies from snow white to reddish-brown with a yellowish-grey hue being the most common. Kapi from alpine forests have pale blue fur and red faces and hands.

***Jungle Homeland.*** Kapi are a race of simian humanoids originally from tropical jungles, where they make their homes in treetop villages. Although most kapi still live in their homeland, their restless tendencies have led many of them to venture forth and explore distant lands. Kapi can be found living alongside humans and other races in villages, towns, and cities throughout the world. 

***Insatiable Curiosity.*** Kapi are intrigued by strangers and are constantly asking questions, often beyond the point where this becomes annoying. Their innate curiosity and good-hearted nature means that kapi will sometimes throw their lot in with adventurers, priests, and other wanderers. Several famous tales recount the escapades of bold and brave kapi who accompanied legendary heroes and pious monks as sidekicks and protectors.

***Playful Tricksters.*** Kapi enjoy playing harmless pranks on others and sometimes acquire unattended items that don't belong to them, using their prehensile tails to grab small objects while no one is looking. These playful antics can often be misunderstood by humorless folk. When this happens, the kapi's ability to scamper up the nearest tree to get out of harm's way proves very handy.

> ##### Kapi in Midgard
>The kapi homeland is the Kamunthalur Jungle in Khandiria, far to the southeast of the Crossroads region and east of the Red Wastes. The great kapi city of Mangchala is located in a hidden gorge deep in the rainforest. Behind a towering waterfall, hundreds of cave mouths in the cliffside lead into the underground city, where the benevolent but capricious Monkey King rules.

>### Reactions

## King Kobold

*Wrapped in tattered finery and draped in silver and gold jewelry, the king kobold sits on a throne, surrounded by an assortment of grisly traps and weaponry. Its crown, a garish mass of precious metals, adds weight to its boastful decrees.*

***Keen Nose for Politics.*** With considerable guile won by hard experience, a king kobold excels at subterfuge, sustains lucrative trade, and hones a keen eye for potential treachery. The king who rules for more than a few seasons has mastered the art of keeping itself safe through a combination of warriors paid well enough to be loyal, a constant campaign to root out enemies, and an abundance of traps, tricks, and contingencies should things go sour. However, security from threats above and below ground and wealth earned through trade are what truly maintain a king on its throne.

***Eyes Everywhere.*** The condition of its warrens and outlying tribes that pay tribute occupy much of a king kobold's time and energy. Tunnel-runners come and go in a constant stream from warren to warren to keep the king abreast of happenings in all of its holdings. A truly successful king may command fealty from a network of tribes stretching for miles.

***Long Live the King.*** Unlike many tribal kobold chieftains, a king kobold leaves the fighting to its underlings whenever possible, except when doing so might weaken its hold on its territory. Few creatures are as ruthless as a threatened king, and the king will not hesitate to sacrifice everything and everyone to escape and live to fight another day.

>***Obscure the Way (1/Day).*** As a bonus action, the shadow fey designates a creature it can see within 100 feet and obscures the creature and its companions' travel on a particular shadow road. That shadow road will not open for the designated creature or its traveling companions except through powerful magical means such as by a key of Veles (see the "Fifth Edition Appendix" in the Midgard Worldbook). In addition, that shadow road won't lead to its usual destination for the designated creature or its traveling companions, instead leading the group in a meandering loop. This effect lasts for 9 (2d8) days, until the shadow fey removes the effect, or until the shadow fey dies.  
>
>***Shadow Traveler (3/Day).*** As a bonus action while in shadows, dim light, or darkness, the shadow fey disappears into the darkness and reappears in an unoccupied space it can see within 30 feet. A tendril of inky smoke appears at the origin and destination when it uses this trait.

A poisoned creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

## Knight of the Road

*A grinning elf with snow white skin and jet-black hair holds up her hand authoritatively, blocking the path forward.*

***Agents of the Shadow Roads.*** Shadow fey knights of the road stalk the lands near shadow gates, or the shadow roads themselves, ever-watchful for opportunities to enrich themselves or improve their station, be it through robbery, ransom, or murder.

***Opportunists and Climbers.*** These shadow elves, often out-of-favor minor nobility, study every nook and cranny of the territory in which they work. They use their accumulated knowledge against their quarry with great effect in the hopes of using new wealth, knowledge, and infamy to curry favor with their betters.

***Never Far from Home..*** Knights of the road prefer to fight, hunt, threaten, and do other business in the Shadow Realm, though they are active anywhere that connects to it.

>
>### Reactions
>***Haunting Vision.*** When a kryt is attacked by a creature it can see within 30 feet of it, the kryt can haunt the creature with a vision of the creature's death. The haunted creature has disadvantage on its next attack roll. Undead creatures and creatures that are unable to be killed are immune to this reaction.

## Kryt

*Kryts are bipedal, ancient-looking tortoises with knowing eyes whose depths seem to swirl with constellations of stars. Short and hearty like dwarves, they attack with great physical power.*

The kryt always settle near water; their oracles and mystics require it. They typically form small tribes in caves or small huts near ponds or reflective bodies of water.

***Dangerous Mystics.*** It is commonly known that kryts are able to see into the future, but few are brave enough to seek their counsel. With a reputation for attacking outsiders and giving chilling predictions, the few who survive their divinations return shaken and speechless with terror. Kryts usually find it easier to use livestock for their sacrificial divinations, but anyone entering their tribe should fear becoming an offering in their insatiable quest for ultimate knowledge of the future.

***Doom Mongers of Haruspicy.*** The kryts are haruspices who predict the future by examining the entrails of a sacrificed creature. Refusing to align themselves with a singular known deity, they claim they have seen prophecies of a cataclysm wrought by an ominous and unnamed power. Kryts live predominately silent lives, striving to save their voices for their ultimate calling as messengers for this mysterious god of death. They never record their findings, preferring to keep what they divine to themselves.

***Secret Society.*** Solitary kryts regard strangers with callous practicality, viewing them as mere pieces of flesh to be beaten and subjugated until they are prepared for a divining sacrifice. Kryts are reluctant to share any of their prophetic visions with others—even members of their own tribe.

## Light Cavalry

*A lithe, red dragonborn wielding a curved cavalry saber and a sturdy steel shield emblazoned with its nation's crest sits upon a cloth-draped warhorse.*

***Mobile Infantry.*** Dragonborn light cavalry are used as scouts and as strike forces for dragonborn military units. Mounted upon warhorses and wearing light armor, these warriors execute rapid, surgical strikes against their enemy's infantry. When the need arises, these agile cavaliers are also used as ground-based scouts to support the army's air-based **wyvern knights**.

## Master of Demon Mountain

*With a dark beard and fiery eyes, the master of Demon Mountain has long been a figure of terror to those who live within sight of his castle. Some say he is the dark, twisted son of Baba Yaga and an unnamed lord of the Abyss. Demons, certainly, bow and speak politely to him, and the least of them jump to his command.*

***Father of Fiends.*** The Master of Demon Mountain is a creature of lascivious appetites and the father of dozens of tieflings—and, at the same time, his family is a source of great pride to him. They are the foundation of an empire, and his brood is loyal and as ambitious as their father. They serve him ably in distant corners of the world, where he sends them to forge alliances through marriages or arcane trades.

***A Bound Legend.*** He remains a figure of legend as well as a political force. An expert demon binder, his power is terrifying even at a distance. But wielding worldly power and extending his influence is merely an entertaining game for him. His real goal is to reach immortality—although first he must break the pacts binding him to his dark manor.

## Master of Demon Mountain (Midgard Version)

*With a dark beard and fiery eyes, the master of Demon Mountain has long been a figure of terror to those who live within sight of his castle. Some say he is the dark, twisted son of Baba Yaga and an unnamed lord of the Abyss. Demons, certainly, bow and speak politely to him, and the least of them jump to his command.*

***Father of Fiends.*** The Master of Demon Mountain is a creature of lascivious appetites and the father of dozens of tieflings—and, at the same time, his family is a source of great pride to him. They are the foundation of an empire, and his brood is loyal and as ambitious as their father. They serve him ably in distant corners of the world, where he sends them to forge alliances through marriages or arcane trades.

***A Bound Legend.*** He remains a figure of legend as well as a political force. An expert demon binder, his power is terrifying even at a distance. But wielding worldly power and extending his influence is merely an entertaining game for him. His real goal is to reach immortality—although first he must break the pacts binding him to his dark manor.

> ##### The Master of Demon Mountain in Midgard
>Hundreds of years ago, the Archmage of Vael Turog escaped the destruction his nation suffered in the Mage Wars and made his way far to the east, where he found a mountain at the site of the conjunction of two powerful ley lines. Located on the southern border of the tsar of Vidim's lands, this mountain was filled with dark and demonic energies and had been considered a blight on the map in the tsar's estimation. The archmage was offered dominion over the mountain if he could tame it and end the threats that issued from it. He summoned and bound a demonic legion, brought the mountain under his control, and staked his claim. The tsar, unaware and uninterested in the details, was delighted, and the archmage became known as the Master of Demon Mountain.
>
>He raised a castle there overnight, called Castle Dontrona, and there he has ruled for so long that the people of the surrounding plains have largely forgotten his name. Out of fear or dread of drawing his attention, they refer to him as "the Master" when occasion demands they speak of him at all.
>
>Since coming to the mountain, the Master's spells and incantations carry greater potency. The demons praise him, and he has mated with more than a few. The pacts the Master swore to gain power over the mountain and its creatures, however, are not the endless font of power that he had hoped. Indeed, he rarely leaves the mountain, and his children suspect he does not truly command it. Instead, the mountain commands him to bring it reagents and perform certain rituals, as demanded by demonic messengers, dreams, or priests of Chernobog.
>
>His lust for power drives him to ally with the Bemmeans, to offer arcana to the Dragon Empire, and to seek the hand of the tsar's comely daughters. His depravity simmers beneath an affected veneer of civility. In distant courts, the Master is known by the name he used in Vael Turog: Roggero Lucar Ordontrona, or sometimes an even older name, Gardever the Archmage of Vael Turog. He claims to be the last living scion of the noble bloodline of Vael Turog. Whether true or an empty boast, he acts the part and then some.

On a failed save, the creature has its speed halved, and it takes a −2 penalty to its AC and Dexterity saving throws for 1 minute. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the metee-kolen-ol's Wintry Gaze for the next 24 hours.  
>A creature that isn't surprised can avert its eyes to avoid the saving throw at the start of its turn.

## Metee-Kolen-Ol

As cold as the land they inhabit, metee-kolen-ol were practitioners of magic who succumbed to corruption at the hands of the sinister gods of the frozen wastes. Now they serve their masters as faithful lieutenants, dispassionately carrying out divine wishes and enforcing divine will. Communities who anger the masters of the metee-kolen-ol sometimes find themselves the targets of savage acts carried out by once-familiar faces, now turned to unfeeling pawns of merciless gods. Those under a metee-kolen-ol's command live in fear of the long marches and hard labors they may be ordered to endure. The metee-kolen-ol never suffer from the cold and are indifferent to negligible losses.

## Necromancer

Necromancers use their power over the undead to conjure servants and to poison, enfeeble, and kill foes with gleeful abandon. They are almost always accompanied by a group of zombies or skeletons; these are more likely to be mold zombies (see page 395), clacking skeletons (see page 340), or other variant undead for necromancers who have had time to establish a work site, pillage vaults and cemeteries, and hone their dark craft. They regularly use poison and poisonous traps and spells, as their undead companions are immune to such effects.

A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself with a success.  
>The ouroban has advantage on attack rolls and ability checks against a creature poisoned by its Abyssal Fires.

## Ouroban

*Blood and slaughter are meat and drink to the ouroban! Strike hard, they say, to hasten the apocalypse—death in the name of the great wyrm!*

***Bringers of Apocalypse.*** Fanatical warriors obsessed with apocalypse and the power they believe will come to them when it arrives, ourobans spread fear, slaughter, and chaos wherever they can. In the doom cults to which they belong, no creature of greater rank rests easy with an ouroban underling as ourobans either claw their way to the top or die in the attempt. Those beneath an ouroban, however, rest a bit easier, so long as they display steady devotion in stoking the ouroban's vanity.

> ##### Ouruban in Midgard
>Venerating a dark, malevolent interpretation of Ouroboros, a number of ourobans joined the ranks of the Doomspeaker cult. Though the cult's disparate cells mainly worship demons, displays of destructive will and power sways them quickly, and ouroborans do not hesitate to take advantage of this. As a result, the ourobans often claim a following of doomspeaker cultists, be they human, dragonborn, kobold, or otherwise. A wise ouroban usually counts a debased cleric or two in its retinue.

## Pattern Dancer

*Shadows weave around a lithe dancing figure, making it difficult to look away. The face of the dancer changes from beautiful to hideous, but always fascinating.*

***Servants of the Queen.*** Pattern dancers train in the arts of deception, magic, combat, and performance, always for a singular purpose: to serve their fey liege, the Queen of Night and Magic (Tome of Beasts, p. 192). The most promising young shadow fey of any gender are taken from their parents at a young age to train. Many fail to meet the rigorous standards, but a few thrive. After years of training and conditioning, they are divided into troupes and begin their lives as pattern dancers.

***Entertainer Spies.*** Pattern dancer troupes, consisting of anywhere from 3–12 dancers plus retainers and bodyguards for larger troupes, leave the Shadow Realm on missions for their queen and spend most of their time in the mortal world. With their reputations already established by their predecessors, troupes are always in demand by the rich, famous, and powerful.

***Spies for Hire.*** While they are ultimately in the service of their queen, pattern dancers also frequently offer their spying services and information gathering skills to the highest bidder. Their payment, however, is often in memories or in other information that they can pass along or provide to their liege.

>
>***Dimensional Seal (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).*** The ramag magically empowers its gate seal to dampen teleportation, planar gates, and portals within 60 feet of it. A creature that attempts to teleport while within or into the area must succeed on a DC 15 Charisma saving throw or the teleport fails. Spells and abilities that conjure creatures or objects automatically fail, and portals or gates are suppressed while they remain in the area. The seal lasts 1 hour, or until the ramag loses concentration on it as if concentrating on a spell.  
>
>***Weave Dimensions.*** The ramag creates two magical gateways in unoccupied spaces it can see within 100 feet of it. The gateways appear as shimmering, opaque ovals in the air. A creature that moves into one gateway appears at the other immediately. The gateways last for 1 minute, or until the ramag loses concentration on them as if concentrating on a spell.

## Ramag Portal Master

*This oddly-proportioned figure weaves its too-long arms in intricate gestures as arcane energy crackles through its thick strands of hair.*

Portal masters are physically indistinguishable from other ramag, though they tend to occupy a higher station. Their clothing and equipment often clearly mark them as spellcasters. The surest mark of a portal master is a gate seal, a large ring of silver, mithral, iron, and copper twisted together. The seal is a focus for the portal master's spellcasting and its manipulation of planar fabric.

***Keepers of the Gates.*** Portal masters fill a potent role within ramag society; they exist to nullify portals, teleportation, and other methods of interplanar travel. Sometimes the flows of magic and the stars align, causing dormant gates to flicker to life. Beyond these gates lie ruins of the ancient titans and lost vestiges of ramag settlements. While some explorers take advantage of the opportunity to reclaim lost knowledge and wealth (and many are lost when the gates slam shut without warning), the portal masters are the first line of defense when other, fouler things come through from the other side.

>***Guard the Big Cheese.*** When a creature makes an attack against the ratfolk mercenary's current employer, the mercenary grants a +2 bonus to the employer's AC if the mercenary is within 5 feet of the employer.

## Ratfolk Mercenary

*With filthy tunics and well-kept leathers, ratfolk slink through fights, always looking to flank, turn, or strike from behind. Their ability to work in large groups leads dwarves to despise them as a "lowly swarm of guttersnipes"—but they are effective.*

Ratfolk survive by their wits and bargains. They are notorious for their willingness to work as mercenaries in large dungeon complexes and to strike pacts with far greater powers than themselves. Ratfolk mercenaries often work in tandem with warlocks acting as captains or sergeants for their employers.

***Mercenary Flexibility.*** Ratfolk mercenaries can be bribed and corrupted with a large enough payment, but they like to say that they "stay bought until payday comes." Usually their loyalty is strong until matters turn against their current master—in some cases they have been known to offer their services to a foe mid-fight!

***Night and Tunnel Specialists.*** Ratfolk mercenaries excel at work in dark, tight quarters, against cavern monsters, and in old dwarven holds. They also enjoy city kidnappings, guarding towers or dungeons, or silent moonlight scouting in hills or forests. They prefer to avoid working in full sun on open fields, though they are professional enough that they can create an effective ambush on riverbanks, in forest shadow, or elsewhere.

***Overbold and Full of Themselves.*** Ratfolk warlocks tend to serve dark powers of shadow or diabolism, though sometimes they simply find the first power willing to make a pact for power (fey or genie-infused ratfolk warlocks are not unknown). The influx of power generally makes ratfolk warlocks insufferably bold, snide, and arrogant—they are convinced that their arcane power makes them the smartest, strongest, and handsomest ratfolk ever to slink through a darkened alley.

***Staves and Amulets.*** As tokens of their pact, ratfolk warlocks always carry or display a profusion of decorated staves, gilded amulets, or clinking silver sigils and rune‑encrusted bells. They are notably less stealthy than most ratfolk.

## Ratfolk Warlock

*With filthy tunics and well-kept leathers, ratfolk slink through fights, always looking to flank, turn, or strike from behind. Their ability to work in large groups leads dwarves to despise them as a "lowly swarm of guttersnipes"—but they are effective.*

Ratfolk survive by their wits and bargains. They are notorious for their willingness to work as mercenaries in large dungeon complexes and to strike pacts with far greater powers than themselves. Ratfolk mercenaries often work in tandem with warlocks acting as captains or sergeants for their employers.

***Mercenary Flexibility.*** Ratfolk mercenaries can be bribed and corrupted with a large enough payment, but they like to say that they "stay bought until payday comes." Usually their loyalty is strong until matters turn against their current master—in some cases they have been known to offer their services to a foe mid-fight!

***Night and Tunnel Specialists.*** Ratfolk mercenaries excel at work in dark, tight quarters, against cavern monsters, and in old dwarven holds. They also enjoy city kidnappings, guarding towers or dungeons, or silent moonlight scouting in hills or forests. They prefer to avoid working in full sun on open fields, though they are professional enough that they can create an effective ambush on riverbanks, in forest shadow, or elsewhere.

***Overbold and Full of Themselves.*** Ratfolk warlocks tend to serve dark powers of shadow or diabolism, though sometimes they simply find the first power willing to make a pact for power (fey or genie-infused ratfolk warlocks are not unknown). The influx of power generally makes ratfolk warlocks insufferably bold, snide, and arrogant—they are convinced that their arcane power makes them the smartest, strongest, and handsomest ratfolk ever to slink through a darkened alley.

***Staves and Amulets.*** As tokens of their pact, ratfolk warlocks always carry or display a profusion of decorated staves, gilded amulets, or clinking silver sigils and rune‑encrusted bells. They are notably less stealthy than most ratfolk.

## Roachling Scout

*With carapace dulled and with antennae sharp, a roaching scout scuttles quietly through shadow and along walls, always evading notice while observing all around it. Their speed and stealth combine to cover a lot of territory.*

***Nose for Sugar.*** Roachling scouts hunt down and retrieve food and other goods their people have trouble attaining due to their appearance and social station. Scouts have an uncanny knack for locating sugar, which is a vital ingredient in a roachling's diet. Their climbing ability and size also make roachling scouts excellent spies.

***Watchers.*** While most roachling scouts are sent to search and find, they are also excellent at watching and waiting. Some cults of **Akyishigal** ([Tome of Beasts](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/creature/Kobold Press; Tome of Beasts.json)) or **Arbeyach** employ them as lookouts and informants.

***Prone to Distraction.*** Roachling scouts can be easy to lead astray with a new scent, a delectable bit of rotting fruit, or a mysterious tune. Their curiosity is their greatest weakness.

## Scorpion Assassin

The various scorpion cults train their believers in the arts of death. Few of their proselytes survive the initiation, but those who do emerge from their trials as assassins of unparalleled skill. Through the worship of their god, scorpion assassins cleanse their souls of emotion and their bodies of warmth. Countless rumors surround the death cult. It is said that a scorpion assassin's heart does not beat and that they stand always on the precipice of life and death. Others say that the assassins are living, but their mortal souls have been excised, and their bodies become vessels for gods of death. Others still claim they were never alive and are celestial reapers sent to usher mortals to their final judgment.

## Serpentfolk of Yig

*The hooded cultist utters a sibilant phrase. Then, like a fading mask of fog, his face suddenly vanishes and in its stead leers a monstrous serpent's head. His terrible, slit eyes blaze unblinkingly as his scaly hands twist and contort in arcane gestures.*

***Priests of the Serpent God.*** Grim tales are told of a prehistoric race of evil snake-people who, wearing the guise of a human cult, have surreptitiously built a monstrous religion around the worship of—the serpent god Yig. As an actor dons a mask, these fiendish humanoids use illusory magic to imitate anyone they wish. This disguise is often betrayed, however, by the presence of the serpentfolk's frightful, fetid scent

***Under Cloak of Blasphemy.*** Serpentfolk of Yig rely on natural cunning and the sorcery of their cold, reptilian bloodline to survive. These snake-people live in secret amongst the cities of civilized nations and plot to overthrow the warm-blooded inheritors of the world "when the stars are right." Known as "they that walk the night," the serpentfolk of Yig live to serve their dark god's hideous, evil agenda. Many seek to become powerful spellcasters and master assassins to better serve their cruel life's purpose. The Queen of Serpents (see page 34) considers the serpentfolk abominations, corrupted versions of true serpents, and there is great enmity between her followers and the followers of Yig.

***The Snake That Speaks.*** In defiance of the creation myths surrounding the World Serpent Veles, the serpentfolk worship their Great Old One progenitor as the true Father of Serpents, knowing him by many names—Set, Quetzelcoatl, and Ningishzida among them. As their insidious cults grow in size—swollen with allied horrors like the Servants of Yig, the **scitalis**, and other reptilian monstrosities—the serpentfolk move further and further from their shadowed jungle enclaves to corrupt the credulous kingdoms of man.

The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.  
>
>***Stuporous Breath (Recharge 5–6).*** The servant of the vine exhales potent fumes in a 15-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 21 (6d6) poison damage and falls asleep, remaining unconscious for 1 minute. On a success, a creature takes half the damage but doesn't fall asleep. The unconscious target awakens if it takes damage or another creature takes an action to wake it. When the creature wakes, it is poisoned until it finishes a short or long rest. The breath has no effect on constructs or undead.

## Servant of the Vine

*A cheerful elf with a glass full of wine sings and dances amid the patrons at the tavern. As the evening wanes, he keeps the party going—straight out the door and into the forest.*

The clergy of the elven god of wine and artistic pursuits follow their patron's edicts by spreading good cheer and inspiring art in all its forms. Their generosity is legendary when it comes to throwing spur-of-the-moment festivals, livening up listless tavern-goers, and offering openhanded patronage of the arts.

***Fools Bearing Unwelcome Wisdom.*** The elves understand the benefits and the hazards a servant of the vine represents and indulge in the revelry and abandon that forms the god's worship with moderation and caution. This is not so easy for the shorter-lived races, however, and the arrival of a servant of the vine among non-elvish people often heralds drunken foolishness, the dissolution of marriages, acts later considered shameful, and young people "taking to the road" with no idea what might await them. For these reasons, they rarely find a warm welcome twice in the same place.

***Artists and Vagabonds.*** A servant of the vine rarely travels alone, usually found in the company of libertine artists of varying kinds, or artistic libertines; the distinction soon blurs after a few days in the servant's company.

Each creature within 30 feet of the ambassador must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by the ambassador, regarding it as a wise and trustworthy ally with the creature's best interests at heart. A charmed target doesn't have to obey the ambassador's commands, but it views the ambassador's words in the most favorable way.  
>Each time a charmed target witnesses the shadow fey ambassador or its allies do something harmful to the target or its companions, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success. Otherwise, the effect lasts as long as the ambassador maintains concentration, up to 8 hours.  
>
>***Withering Stare.*** The shadow fey ambassador targets one creature it can see within 30 feet of it. If the target can see it, the target must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened for 1 minute. The frightened target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a target's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the target is immune to the ambassador's Withering Stare for the next 24 hours.

## Shadow Fey Ambassador

*Stylishly dressed, this beautiful fey has alabaster-white skin, pointed ears, and a small pair of curved horns. Her face displays a cruel and cunning smile as she reads from a long parchment covered in elvish writing—a treaty full of devious sub-clauses and near‑unreadable small lettering.*

When fey lords and ladies need to treat with mortals on matters of interest, they will often dispatch a shadow fey ambassador to negotiate on their behalf. These silver-tongued ambassadors are diplomats par excellence, capable of blending charm, bribery, and sheer menace to get what they want.

***Hidden Embassies.*** When it arrives into a city, the shadow fey ambassador will first choose a disused building to establish its base of operations. This embassy is usually well hidden with few individuals entrusted with its location. Shadow fey ambassadors staff their embassy with plenty of minions, including other shadow fey, **shadow goblins**, and **hounds of the night** ([Tome of Beasts](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/creature/Kobold Press; Tome of Beasts.json)). Many ambassadors have a **shadow fey guardian** as a personal bodyguard.

***Haughty Proclamations.*** Once established, a shadow fey ambassador will inveigle itself into the local circles of power, then issue a proclamation outlining the wishes of the fey lord or lady to the mortal rulers. They will set out the many benefits of enthusiastic cooperation with these demands and the dire consequences of failing to comply. The unscrupulous shadow fey then respond as necessary with hefty bribes, intimidation, or assassination to bring recalcitrant mortals around to their way of thinking.

## Shadow Fey Poisoner

*It's only after he is lying on the ground, bleeding from an arrow wound in the chest and writhing from the poison seeping through his veins, that the victim sees the pale elf.*

***Accomplished Killers.*** Raised in the dark dwellings of the Shadow Realm, the shadow fey are fleet of foot, quick of thought, and glib of tongue. Just a little extra training with poison, weapons, and magic makes them into uniquely-qualified killers.

***The Poisoner's Code.*** A shadow fey poisoner never gives the name of an employer, is rarely captured alive, and never kills the target except in self-defense.

## Shadow Goblin

*This hunched and scrawny goblin has a long nose and pointed ears and wears an insincere, obsequious expression on its slategrey face. Dressed in a servant's uniform, it conceals a large knife behind its back.*

***Unseelie Servants.*** Someone needs to cook the meals, scrub the floors, and polish the silverware in the courts of the shadow fey, and more often than not these jobs fall on the shadow goblins. Smarter than the average goblin but just as cowardly and lazy, shadow goblins have served the shadow fey for centuries, working in the kitchens, stables, and smithies under the direction of a chamberlain known as the Goblin King, who presides over his own "court" below stairs. Shadow goblins make good cooks and reasonable grooms, but they are indifferent footmen and chambermaids.

***Touched by Shadow.*** Most shadow goblins were originally average goblins but living in the Shadow Realm for so long has changed them. They have taken on some of their masters' fey qualities. Others were once shadow fey or humans, who were caught stealing from powerful members of the courts or who offended shadow fey rulers and were transformed into shadow goblins as punishment.

***Untrustworthy Guides.*** Outsiders of low status visiting the shadow fey courts often end up relying on shadow goblins as guides and sources of information. Unfortunately, the goblins tend to be both annoyingly whiny and notorious liars. Although they are easily intimidated, shadow goblins are never truly cooperative and will disappear at the first sign of danger. Their loyalty to their shadow fey masters is born out of fear. They are reluctant to do anything that is likely to upset their masters and lead to a thrashing. Those outsiders that bully the goblins tend to suffer subsequently from badly-cooked food, missing bits of gear, and other petty acts of retribution.

>***Drawn from Beyond (Recharge 5–6).*** The speaker conjures up to 3 ghasts. The ghasts appear in unoccupied spaces within 30 feet of the speaker that the speaker can see. The ghasts follow the speaker's commands, and it is immune to their Stench. It can't have more than 3 ghasts conjured at one time.  
>
>***Extinguish Light (1/rest).*** The speaker creates a 15-foot-radius sphere of magical darkness on a point it can see within 60 feet. This darkness works like the darkness spell, except creatures inside it have disadvantage on saving throws and the speaker and its conjured ghasts are unaffected by the darkness.

## Speaker to the Darkness

*Guano stains the bat fur robe and flayed-skin cloak of this creature. Its mustache is braided with beads of carved bone and its balding head is circled in straw-like white hair.*

The speaker to the darkness wears a mask and a cloak of flayed skin over a robe of bat fur. Its bare feet are caked with dried guano, while its clothing is spattered with fresher samples.

***Priest of Camazotz, Demon Lord of Bats.*** The speaker to the darkness oversees the religious aspects of the derro bat cult, leading rituals and sacrifices, consulting with **Lord Camazotz** ([Tome of Beasts](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/creature/Kobold Press; Tome of Beasts.json)), and organizing expeditions to the surface for prisoners. It often squabbles with other derro priests and leaders over how to divide such prisoners between them. The howling winds of the outer dark soothe its troubled mind, reminding it of the great destiny before it and its ultimate gift to its **Lord Camazotz**: eternal darkness.

>
>***Crush.*** One creature grappled by the swolbold must make a DC 14 Strength saving throw, taking 21 (5d6 + 4) bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

## Swolbold

*From behind the collection of angry kobolds steps a creature the size of a dwarf, its bulging muscles flexing as its kobold-like snout twists into a terrible grin.*

***A Beast Among Kobolds.*** The swolbold is the brute of the kobold world, a hulking specimen among its smaller and more fragile cousins. Roughly the height of a dwarf but much wider, the rippling muscles of the swolbold betray its ferocious strength. In contrast to the sneakiness and cunning of the kobold, the swolbold is straightforward and devastating in combat.

***Bred for Destruction.*** Swolbolds are very rare, and their penchant for unthinking destruction has stumped sages. Some theorize that swolbolds have been bred by evil wizards in arcane experiments gone horribly wrong. Others state the dark gods revered by kobolds gift these monsters to tribes particularly fervent in their worship. Others still conclude that carefully crafted alchemy transformed normal kobolds into these beastly creatures. Regardless of the swolbold's origins, experts agree on one thing: you don't want to meet a swolbold in a dark, subterranean lair.

***Fighting Style.*** The physiognomy of the swolbold allows them to shrug off most mundane blows. Their preferred fighting style is to crush the life out of their foes, rather than stabbing and scuttling like their smaller cousins. Their girth makes fitting into normal armor difficult, so their tribal leaders often create piecemeal armor for them: scraps of metal plates held over vital areas with bits of leather or rope.

One or two swolbolds may accompany a larger force of kobolds, acting at the vanguard of an attack. The larger creatures act as battering rams and moving shields, allowing the smaller kobolds to use their ranged attacks and devious tactics to the greatest effect.

## The Barbed

*A brawny looking kobold brandishes a manticore spike driven through its scaled hand.*

***Leaders.*** The barbed are physically stronger than their brethren and bear the scars of living close to manticores. They are devoted to Mantik and believe he is a divine being who will lead them to victory over the drakes of the waste and the dragons of the mountains.

***Marked.*** The barbed are known by the large tail spike (from Mantik himself) driven through their wrist and hand. They are immune to the poison that still seeps from the spike.

>***Protect Me.*** When a creature the thief lord can see targets it with an attack, the thief lord can sidestep behind an ally within 5 feet of it, moving to an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the ally. The chosen ally becomes the target of the attack instead.

## Thief Lord

It takes more than a quick blade to lead thieves. The thief lord makes use of considerable personal charm and a keen mind to direct the efforts of its fellows. Most thief lords prefer to keep one foot in law-abiding society and one foot in crime, though which world receives the greater part of their attention varies. Paranoid of assassination attempts by rivals, the thief lord takes minute doses of various poisons daily and has developed resistance to such substances.

>- **Proficiency Bonus** +2
>___
>***Pheromones.*** The jeweled drone emits a sweet scent that empowers other tosculi within 15 feet of the drone. A tosculi that starts its turn within the area can add a d6 to one attack roll or saving throw it makes before the start of its next turn, provided it can smell the scent. A tosculi can benefit from only one Pheromones die at a time. This effect ends if the jeweled drone dies.  
>
>***Scintillating Carapace.*** While in bright light, the jeweled drone's carapace shines and glitters. When a non-tosculi creature that can see the drone starts its turn within 30 feet of the drone, the drone can force the creature to make a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw if the drone isn't incapacitated. On a failure, the creature is blinded until the start of its next turn.  
>Unless surprised, a creature can avert its eyes to avoid the saving throw at the start of its turn. If it does so, it can't see the drone until the start of its next turn, when it can avert its eyes again. If it looks at the drone in the meantime, it must immediately make the save.  
>
>### Actions
>***Multiattack.*** The jeweled drone makes three attacks. two with its claws and one with its scimitar.  
>
>***Claws.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 7 (1d6 + 4) slashing damage.  
>
>***Scimitar.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 7 (1d6 + 4) slashing damage plus 10 (3d6) poison damage. If the poison damage reduces the target to 0 hp, the target is stable but poisoned for 1 hour, even after regaining hp, and is paralyzed while poisoned in this way.  
>
>### Reactions
>***Protect the Queen.*** When a creature makes an attack against a tosculi hive queen, the jeweled drone grants a +2 bonus to the queen's AC if the drone is within 5 feet of the queen.

## Tosculi Jeweled Drone

*A wasp-like humanoid flits on humming wings. Its carapace gleams with bright jewel tones, flashing brilliantly in the light.*

In tosculi hive cities, powerful queens reign supreme, but even they have difficulty managing an entire swarm on their own. To extend their reach and authority, they rely on jeweled drones. More intelligent than most other tosculi, jeweled drones oversee individual aspects of the swarm and hive, managing the efficient order that constrains tosculi life. The jeweled drones produce powerful pheromones that help extend their authority and that also serve to forge nearby tosculi into a precise and deadly fighting force.

***Queen's Attendants.*** Jeweled drones are closest to the hive queens in both authority and physical proximity. They serve as advisors to the queen, bringing her news and information from all corners of the hive. It's not uncommon for queens to choose consorts from among the ranks of jeweled drones as well. Such favored wasp folk enjoy unparalleled influence, until the queen tires of and devours them

*Servants and lackeys of vampires, vampire thralls receive blood from their masters' veins periodically, granting them a number of benefits so long as they continue to receive their masters' blood.*

Vampire thralls are not themselves undead, though many are hopeful they soon will be. Ingesting humanoid blood is in no way beneficial to a thrall, but this fact has not prevented many from trying.

>***Howl (Recharge 5–6).*** The vanara releases a sonorous howl in a 15-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 18 (4d8) thunder damage and is deafened for 1 minute. On a success, the creature takes half the damage and isn't deafened.

## Vanara

*Wearing short pants and a colorful turban, this monkey-like creature howls a warning, its tan fur bristling.*

Quick and agile, vanara's long arms and prehensile tails are quite adept at many tasks. Their bodies are covered in fur, usually brown or black, but sometimes grey, white, or auburn. While they do bundle up in colder climates, most vanaras dress only in short pants or waist wraps and a colorful or plain white turban.

***Efficient and Supportive.*** Vanaras are a contemplative race that dwells in forests or along coastlines. They live in tribes or clans, which are self-sufficient and have little need for trade with cities. They are quite helpful to outsiders that seek assistance, however, for they believe that good deeds towards others will be returned.

***Sentinels of the Forest.*** Unlike their restless kapi cousins, vanaras are content with life in the forest and feel it is their duty to protect it. They communicate via rich, sonorous songs that can be heard for miles, warning those of ill intent not to tread in areas under their protection.

***Deeply Spiritual.*** Many vanaras spend hours meditating on topics that face their tribes or lands, seeking guidance from higher powers. They regularly gather to sing in deep, booming harmony in their own form of prayer to such higher powers.

## Void Cultist

Cultists are the most numerous void-touched; simple men and women taken and changed by the corrupt touch of the Void. Quite mad, they throw themselves into their filthy rituals and to certain death against their enemies with equal abandon. Void cultists show the corrupt nature of the Void in their bodies. Twisted and warped, they use these deformities as weapons against the enemies of the cult. While the cultists speak Void Speech, they lack the control to cause more than superficial pain and destruction with its vile syllables.

## Void Speaker

The most revered void-touched, the void speakers whisper antitruths in Void Speech, drawing power from the tainted unwords. They often began as wizards who stumbled upon some scrap of forbidden lore and studied it so deeply it consumed them. Now they form the leadership and direction of clandestine void cults. Wizards are no strangers to the power of words, and those who accept the gifts of the Void become formidable foes of all sane life. The void speaker can reshape reality with its tainted words, splitting the flesh of foes, driving them mad with fear, or hurling them bodily to the ground.

> ##### Void Speakers in Midgard
>Feared and exterminated by all life-loving people, the void speakers are often the founders of cults that turn entire villages to evil in the Western Wastes, the Red Wastes, or sometimes in the extreme north or south. Their goal is usually to chant praise of dark gods until those gods answer—and to pillage and plunder in an unholy war in the meantime.

On a success, the creature takes half the damage and is knocked prone but isn't pulled into the event horizon.

## Voidwracked Mage

Dabbling in void magic often leads to unexpected and horrific results. A voidwracked mage is a spellcaster whose reckless experimentation has accidentally fused it with a portal to the Void itself. The driving purpose of a voidwracked mage is to increase the total entropy of the multiverse by consuming creatures with the event horizon to which it is fused. A voidwracked mage often serves more powerful void-touched creatures.

> ##### Voidwracked Mages in Midgard
>Void magic often ends in spectacular disasters; the voidwracked mages are found almost entirely in the Western Wastes among the Dread Walkers and the dust goblins. Dust goblins of great age often aspire to the status of voidwracked mage, becoming living weapons against their tribe's enemies. Occasionally such a mage is found in Bemmea, Barsella, or (in one memorable case) Friula.

## War Chaplain

The proud clergy of the god of honor and war, war chaplains promote and revere feats of bravery and sacrifice, committing such acts themselves. Warriors and soldiers seek their blessings before battle, and mercenaries ask their guidance in selecting a potential employer. War chaplains are always willing to provide this blessing and to advise mercenaries. They are often quite canny in knowing how a particular battle is likely to proceed, not always through divine knowledge or visions but simply through long experience and a sense of an army's potential and morale. The most capable war chaplains are often invited to ride with the officers or dine with generals, though they stand slightly outside the chain of command—they serve their god first.

War chaplains are both quite aggressive in battle and aware of the boundaries between war and its victims. While most of their ministry is devoted to counseling soldiers and officers, ruling on cases of plunder, or enforcing discipline in the ranks, they find time to comfort citizens, children, widows, and others in the wake of war. The glories of combat do not blind them to their duties under the laws of war. War chaplains are also necessarily well-versed in a broad range of funeral rites and practices, for their faithful soldiers often follow more than one tradition.

>***Blessing of War.*** When an ally the war priest can see within 30 feet hits with a melee weapon attack, the war priest can make the weapon deal an extra 9 (2d8) radiant (good or neutral priests) or necrotic (evil priests) damage.

## War Priest

Priests lead a flock; some with words, and others by example. A war priest leads with words, actions, and no small amount of physical violence against its enemies. While a war priest leads the faithful, it also exemplifies the traits representative of its deity. The weapons may change, from the hammers and axes of dwarven gods to the swords of the elves to the shortswords of the halflings. Regardless of the deity, though, the ability to bring holy or unholy damage to the fight is the hallmark of the war priest. Unlike a war chaplain, a war priest is always counted among the commanders of an army and is often a personal adviser to the army's general. In some cases, the war priest also serves as a general.

>***Bite (Bat or Hybrid Form Only).*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 7 (2d4 + 2) piercing damage. If the target is a humanoid, it must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or be cursed with werebat lycanthropy.

>
>***Mace (Humanoid Form Only).*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. *Hit:* 5 (1d6 + 2) bludgeoning damage.

## Werebat

*A lean, muscled humanoid covered in short, velvet-like fur crouches on the rooftop, its long, membranous wings drooping to the ground like the sleeves of a long robe. Its face bears little trace of anything humanoid with large, pointed ears, needle-like teeth, black eyes, flaring nostrils, and dark fur.*

***Night Hunters.*** Werebats hunt by night, swooping down from the darkness on unsuspecting prey and leaving mutilated corpses behind, often partially exsanguinated. When hunting, a werebat often takes on the form of a hideous, human-sized bat with a wingspan the length of a horse.

***Idolatry or Isolation.*** In cultures that worship bat deities, werebats are often seen as holy creatures. They may occupy clerical roles in such societies, though their tendency toward malevolence drives them to use such positions to seek greater power. Werebats living in less convenient circumstances seek out isolated lairs overlooking remote settlements, moving frequently when their gory presence draws too much attention.

Regardless of their circumstances, werebats usually have a swarm of bats at their command.

***Telltale Features.*** Werebats in their humanoid form often display bat-like features; a flattened or upturned nose, tufts of dark hair topping pointed ears, or sharp teeth are common.

>
>***Scimitar (Gnoll or Hybrid Form Only).*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 7 (1d8 + 3) slashing damage.

## Werehyena

*The hyena's form shifts into that of a gnoll and then to something in between. In all three forms, blood drips from its filthy muzzle.*

***A Blessed Curse.*** Across worlds and in all their cultures, the gnolls have always revered the hyena. Those who suffer the curse of lycanthropy also exhibit it in the same way: the form of a werehyena. This is considered a rare and wonderful gift, as most gnolls who suffer this curse die the first time they change. Those who survive, however, are honored in their culture.

***A Demonic Affliction.*** In truth, the lycanthropy that werehyenas suffer is a demonic possession. The souls of these creatures have been forfeited to a demon lord. Only gnolls are able to survive this intact. If they spread this disease to a non-gnoll, the victim survives until the first full moon, after which it dies and turns into a demon gnoll under the demon lord's sway. The only way to save the victim is to cure the disease before the first transformation.

***A Terrible Cure.*** Normally a *remove curse* removes lycanthropy from a victim, but slightly more stringent efforts are needed to cleanse a werehyena's bite. While the *remove curse* spell is being cast, a demonic creature must be killed in the vicinity of the victim, and the victim must drink the demon's ichor. Only then is the lycanthropy removed permanently. Finding such a creature can be difficult and often means making deals with dark forces.

Like the rest of her clan, the inscrutable thoughts and actions of the derro witch queen may seem random and chaotic, but at their core the derro find themselves moving toward a common goal.

***Ruler and Servant.*** The witch queen looks different from other derro. Her pale skin and dark raven hair set her apart, as do her cold, black-pupiled eyes. These changes come over the witch queen upon the death of the previous witch queen, when the mad soul of the witch queen transfers from one host to the next. While outsiders may think the witch queen rules her clan, the opposite is true. The witch queen responds to the unfocused, rambling thoughts of each member of her clan. Her synchronicity with every member of the clan informs all her actions and decisions, making her the maddest of the mad.

>***Draconic Visage (1/Day).*** The wizard kobold magically creates a draconic visage in an unoccupied space it can see within 30 feet. The visage is a glowing, spectral head and neck, resembling a variety of dragon chosen by the kobold, that sheds dim light out to 10 feet. The visage lasts for 1 minute and grants the following benefits:  
>- A creature hostile to the wizard who starts its turn within 30 feet of the visage and who is aware of the visage must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to this effect for the next 24 hours.
>- The wizard gains immunity to the damage type dealt by the chosen dragon's breath weapon.
>- When the wizard uses this action, and as a bonus action on it subsequent turns, it can use the following attack:  
  - **Breath of the Visage.** *Ranged Spell Attack:* +6 to hit, range 120 ft., one target. *Hit:* 7 (2d6) damage of the type dealt by the chosen dragon's breath weapon.

## Wizard Kobold

*An aura of power, centered on a glowing purple crystal atop a short staff, crackles around this pale kobold and arcs across the horns on its headdress. A luminous, leering dragon face fades into being, ghostly and terrible, behind it.*

Wizard kobolds are among the most cunning and intelligent of the scaly kin. They turn their talent for manipulating arcane magic to study and formula, often getting their start with a stolen spellbook, or one purloined from the remains of an adventurer who met its end in a kobold trap.

***Draconic Channel.*** Wizard kobolds have made a fearsome reputation for themselves with their ability to tap into their draconic heritage through their magic. The wizard draws magic either from a patron dragon or an ancestral dragon figure, manifesting it as a magical effigy. This apparition lends its resilience to the wizard and brings terror and death to the kobold's enemies.

## Woodwose

*Broad-chested and muscular, this feral-looking man's torso is covered in a coat of thick, dark hair. His eyes are deep-set and black, and his beard is matted and tangled with bits of twig. His only clothes are a headdress and a loin cloth woven from ivy leaves.*

Woodwoses are hairy, near-naked wild humans of the woods who live close to nature, deep in the ancient forests where the boundary between the Material Plane and the lands of the fey becomes blurred.

***Hairy Climbers.*** Woodwoses are very hairy. Their bodies are covered in a thick coat apart from the faces, hands, and feet. Despite their heavy physiques, woodwoses are able climbers, allowing them to use the tallest trees of the wood as vantage points.

***Friends of the Fey.*** Bands of woodwoses can often be found following a **green knight of the woods** (see page 209) or other powerful fey, and they are usually on friendly terms with forest-dwelling elves. Stealthy hunters capable of casting druidic magic, woodwoses remain vigilant against orcs, **forest marauders** ([Tome of Beasts](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/creature/Kobold Press; Tome of Beasts.json), p. 205), over-zealous foresters, and any others who seek to harm the animals, trees, and plants of the woodlands. Their jet black eyes glow emerald green when they are angered. 

***Mysterious Origins.***  Woodwoses have lived in the remotest parts of the world's forests for centuries and are only remembered by most civilised societies in fireside tales. One far-fetched story says that the first wild men of the woods were human children who fled into the forest to escape a band of savage raiders and were raised by wolves or other wild animals. Another says they were normal men who were cursed with their hairy bodies and somewhat warped physiques by the **Queen of Witches** ([Tome of Beasts](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/creature/Kobold Press; Tome of Beasts.json), p. 194) for spying on her while she bathed beneath a woodland waterfall.

>### Reactions
>***Protection.*** When a creature the wyvern knight can see attacks a target that is within 5 feet of it, including a creature it is riding, the knight can use a reaction to impose disadvantage on the attack roll. The knight must be wielding a shield.

## Wyvern Knight

*Clad in armor and carrying a spiked lance, the knight grips tight to the reins of its wyvern mount. The knight snarls, goading its mount forward.*

For centuries, many realms have been safeguarded by knights on horseback, their advanced mobility and powerful steeds cutting through infantry lines like shears through cloth. But against the wyvern knights, even mighty cavaliers are little more than worms to be snapped up by a hungry starling. The wyvern knights are trained to ride domesticated war wyverns (see page 386), using their aerial mobility to perform countless roles on the battlefield from shattering cavalry charges to sowing chaos from behind enemy lines.

***Baal's First.*** A group of **elite kobolds**, calling themselves Baal's First Legion, works with a dragonborn wyvern knight commander. The kobolds themselves hang onto leather straps and buckle themselves onto the commander's war wyvern for swift transport across a battlefield. As arsonists, scouts, and ambushers, they've been extremely effective.

>- The yakirian's maximum and current hp increase by 10 for 1 hour.
>- The yakirian has advantage on Strength-based attack rolls and ability checks, as well as on all saving throws for 1 hour.

## Yakirian

*The chain armor and ritual knife of this burly yak man are stained with old blood, and its long horns are etched with intricate patterns.*

***Isolated Mountain Dwellers.*** Yakirians stand 7 feet tall and are covered in shaggy fur with two horns growing from their yak-like heads. Yakirians live in an isolated caste society that promotes efficiency and cooperation.

***Resilient Enlightenment.*** Yakirians are a spiritual people, following the teachings of Brother Ox (see page 24). Through his example, they maintain a balance between mind, body, and spirit.

***Heart Eaters.*** Yakirian ritually consume the hearts of humanoids and giants to absorb the creature's knowledge and strength, and to bolster their battle prowess. They also perform this as a funeral rite as the most respectful way to honor and preserve the knowledge and strength of the departed.

***Nemesis of Leng.*** While most of their population is nomadic, the heart of yakirian society lies on the remote plateau of Leng. Yakirians are a bulwark against the twisted creatures of Leng, and believe their primary purpose is to prevent the spread of that dark influence.

> ##### Variant: Schism Yakirian
>Yakirian culture is split. One side holds to the oath of enlightenment, while the other encourages devouring the souls of their enemies. This affords the yakirian greater power but destroys the victim's soul in the process. The different yakirian groups still work together other to oppose the remnants of Leng.
>
>A yakirian who follows the divergent philosophy gains the following trait.
>
>***Soul Consumption.*** When a schism yakirian consumes a creature's heart, it also consumes the soul. The duration of the benefits increases to 8 hours. In addition, the yakirian gains advantage on all attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws, and all attack rolls made against the yakirian have disadvantage. The soul is trapped within the yakirian for 24 hours, after which it is destroyed. If the yakirian dies before that time, the soul is released. While the soul is trapped, any magic used to revive the dead creature fails unless the caster succeeds on a DC 15 spellcasting ability check. Once the soul is destroyed, only a *wish* spell can bring it back.

>A schism yakirian has a challenge rating of 3 (700 XP).
