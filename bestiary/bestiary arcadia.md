## Garin Najis

To say that Garin Najis was born with a silver spoon in his mouth would be an understatement—start with platinum, and then change spoons for every bite. After a life of opulence, he should want for nothing, yet all he does is want. His path of avarice started early and only deepened.

Born to wealthy nobles who owned several emerald mines, there was never a moment in his upbringing where he felt lack or need. He bragged about how he walked around with uncut gems in his pockets in his days at the academy. When he came of age and his parents decided to teach him how to manage the mines, he was initially horrified. They exploited their miners for little pay and forced them to work in dangerous conditions under strict contracts that prevented departure.

Everything suddenly clicked into place for Garin. As it dawned on him that this exploitation was the reason for his wealth...he embraced it. But unlike his parents, whose zeal for hard capital was secular, Garin looked at his inheritance and saw it as his divine duty to Pta'u to expand, grow, and consume. He would never be satisfied. He convinced his workers that their labor in his service was a path to the divine. Their hard work, sweat, and tears would lead to countless rewards in the next life... and countless rewards in this life for Garin.

A prosperity preacher of the highest order, Garin keeps a close counsel of powerful, mercenary-minded adventurers and commands a loyal following of brainwashed cult-like laborers who literally die to hand him a freshly mined gem. Garin can be found most often managing his various enterprises, but as of late he has felt the itch of adventure and has taken to traveling in search of more resources (both material and humanoid) to exploit.

Garin never faces down an enemy without a well-prepared battlefield or plenty of minions. His primary strategy is to keep as much cannon fodder between him and his foes while simultaneously bolstering his legions and himself. He makes good use of his Prophet Motive feature to keep buffs on his allies and himself while using spells like *guardian of faith* and *spirit guardians* to control the battlefield to his liking. He is a coward at heart and will leave his minions to die if he sees the tides turning against him.

While he has these temporary hit points, Kryx can't revert to his humanoid form, and he gains one additional melee attack as part of his Multiattack action.

For the next minute, any creature in physical contact with the object takes 9 (2d8) fire damage when Kryx casts the spell. Until the spell ends, Kryx can use a bonus action on each of his subsequent turns to cause this damage again. If a creature is holding or wearing the object and takes the damage from it, the creature must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or drop the object if it can. If it doesn't drop the object, it has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks until the start of Kryx's next turn. Kryx must concentrate on the spell.   
>
>***Call Lightning (3rd Level Spell; Requires a Spell Slot).*** A storm cloud appears in the shape of a cylinder that is 10 feet tall with a 60-foot radius, centered on a point Kryx can see within range directly above him. The spell fails if Kryx can't see a point in the air where the storm cloud could appear (for example, if he is in a room that can't accommodate the cloud).  
>When Kryx casts the spell, he chooses a point he can see under the cloud. A bolt of lightning flashes down from the cloud to that point. Each creature within 5 feet of that point must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 16 (3d10) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. On each of Kryx's turns until the spell ends, he can use his action to call down lightning in this way again, targeting the same point or a different one. The spell lasts 10 minutes, and Kryx must concentrate on it.  
>If Kryx is outdoors in stormy conditions when he casts this spell, the spell gives him control over the existing storm instead of creating a new one. Under such conditions, the spell's damage increases by 5 (1d10).

## Valdek Karuul

Few survive a titan attack and live to speak of it. An elf born of the sea, Valdek Karuul always loved working on ships. The sea was his home, and sailors were his people. He signed on with a merchant vessel named the Ebon Crow that transported gems, foodstuffs, and passengers. One night, a massive behemoth of the sea attacked the Ebon Crow. The ocean titan Veldaza tore the ship to shreds with its claws and tentacles. Only Valdek survived—but he didn't escape unscathed. A claw from the beast dug into his back, imbuing the elf with Veldaza's residual magic.

As Valdek swam through the waves away from the monster, his own form grew. He suddenly matched size with sea lions and sharks, and he could harness spells that no mage he'd ever shipped out with knew.

Now Valdek wanders the sea under his own power, watching for pirates and those who would harm sailors, including the titan that gave him this magic. Sailors in Valdek's territory often tell tales of the time they were saved by a giant elf now dubbed the Titanic Guardian of the Sea.
