# Factions

Disfavor with a faction imposes disadvantage on all Charisma (Persuasion) and Charisma (Intimidate) skill checks made with that faction. In the case of Favors with large groups, you only gain this penalty when interacting with those of high station such as a general, a king, or the patriarch of a patrician family associated with that power.

* You may use a Favor to cancel a Disfavor from the same faction. This voids both the Favor and Disfavor immediately.

* You may spend a Favor with a given faction/group/individual (at GM’s discussion) to gain the benefits of a one-time expenditure of 3 fame with that faction/group/individual. You may spend two favors with the same factionBto gain the benefits of a 5-point fame expenditure.

Важный момент. Члены фракция делятся на регуляров и нерегуляров. Регулярные члены фракции работают за деньги на фракцию и получают урезанные бенефиты. Нерегуляры обладают большей свободой, и в зависимости от ситуации могут даже отказаться от задания.

Конкретная реализация зависит в каждом случае от конкретной игры, мастера, игрока и задания.
Пример. Белдора Арфист в СКТ - регуляр.

Персонажи в Лунном море и приключениях сезонных Лиги - регуляры.

Персонаж арфист в ОоотА, СКТ, Принцах Апокалипсиса - не регуляр.

Rank 3 (Stalwart) Downtime Activities
Members of the five factions that have achieved
rank 3 have access to the following special
downtime activities when adventuring in and
around Mulmaster.
Harpers: Arcane Amnesty
You have friends within the Cloaks—an order of
arcanists in Mulmaster—that are sympathetic to
the Harpers’ cause. You have advantage on any
social interaction checks to exonerate you or
anyone in your group for using restricted magic
in and around the city. In addition, you can
spend downtime days to have an arrested caster
freed from prison or harsh punishment. The cost
is 1 downtime day per level of the violating spell.
Order of the Gauntlet: Judge Friend
You are a dueling judge, and have overseen
many duels in Mulmaster. You have the ear of
friends within the dueling judge community, and
can call upon the services of a battlehardened
warrior to lend you aid. At the beginning of an
adventure or when appropriate, you can spend 5
downtime days to recruit a veteran (see
appendix B of the Monster Manual). The veteran
performs any tasks within reason and capability,
but parts ways with you after taking part in one
combat or at the end of the adventure.
Emerald Enclave: Secluded Haven
You have a secret place just outside the city
where you and your allies can rest, recuperate,
and find mounts. When you use the recuperating
downtime activity (see the Basic Rules or the
Player’s Handbook), you can apply the effects to
your entire group. In addition, at the beginning of
an adventure or when appropriate, you can
spend downtime days to borrow mounts (riding
horses, ponies, or mules) for yourself and your
group. The cost is 1 downtime day per mount
borrowed. All mounts must be returned at the
end of the adventure. If any mount dies during
the course of the adventure, you must pay half
its value in gold.
Lords’ Alliance: Hawk Association
You are part of the Hawks, the secret police of
Mulmaster. You maintain law and order through
intimidation and strongarm tactics. You can
coerce information from the common folk for
your benefit, gaining advantage on any
Charisma (Intimidation) checks to do so. Once
per adventure at the beginning of an adventure,
you can spend 3 downtime days to learn an
adventure secret. The Dungeon Master provides
you with a secret that only you know about the
adventure, and you gain advantage on all
checks to recall related information for the
duration of the adventure.
Zhentarim: Procure Illicit Goods
You have contacts among smugglers residing in
the ghettos of the city, who are able to procure
restricted and illicit items for you. At the
beginning of an adventure or when appropriate,
you can spend 2 downtime days to gain one of
the following items for the duration of the
adventure: carrion crawler mucus, serpent
venom, or a moldering scroll holding a 1st-level
spell of your choice. Then roll on the Procure
Illicit Goods table to see what happens as a
result of your dealings.
Procure Illicit Goods (Mulmaster)
d20 Result
1–3 You are caught red-handed and jailed
for 1d8 days. You do not gain the item.
You must spend additional downtime
days to cover this jail time, but you do
not spend your lifestyle costs for these
days. You can avoid jail by paying 50 gp
per day of jail time.
4–6 You are accosted by the city watch
while making the deal. You lose 100 gp
and begin the adventure at half your hit
point maximum, but you manage to
retain possession of the item.
7–12 You find a fence willing to sell you the
item, but it’s going to cost you. Make a
DC 10 Charisma (Persuasion) check. If
you succeed, you pay 50 gp for the
item. If you fail, you pay 200 gp for the
item.
13–18 You are able to swindle or fast-talk your
way into obtaining the item, gaining it for
free.
19–20 You manage to obtain one item for free
while attempting to steal another. Make
a DC 10 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand)
check. If you succeed, choose two
different items instead of one. You gain
both of the items for free. If you fail, you
instead gain one item for free.
Season 3 Rage of Demons/Hillsfar
Rank 3 (Stalwart) Downtime Activities
Members of the five factions who have achieved
rank 3 have access to the following special
downtime activities when adventuring in and
around Hillsfar and in the Underdark beneath
the city.
Harpers—Mental Fortitude. You are a
Brightcandle of the Harpers. Under the tutelage
of your faction-mates in Elventree, you have
learned the secrets of healing the mind. If you
are afflicted with any type of madness, you can
spend one downtime day to reduce your
madness level by 1, and to cure any short-term
madness or long-term madness that afflicts you.
You can do the same for allies, but the cost is
three downtime days per ally cured. You cannot
use this benefit to cure indefinite madness, and
you cannot reduce your madness level to 0 if
you are afflicted with indefinite madness.
Members of the five factions who have achieved
rank 3 have access to the following special
downtime activities when adventuring in and
around Hillsfar and in the Underdark beneath
the city.
Order of the Gauntlet—Investiture of the
Divine. You are a Whitehawk in the Order of the
Gauntlet, and have been a participant in prayer
circles and rites to combat the demons spilling
from the Underdark. You can spend ten
downtime days to gain an investiture of the
divine that lasts until your next long rest. While
your investiture is active, you can use a bonus
action on each of your turns to grant you or an
ally within 30 feet of you the ability to bypass
damage resistances on the next attack made
against a demon. This benefit does not bypass a
demon’s immunities.
Emerald Enclave—Madness Ward. You are an
Autumnreaver of the Emerald Enclave, and
know that the madness creeping to the surface
world from the depths of the Underdark is wholly
unnatural. By performing cleansing rituals and
warding areas where demonic madness has
been seen or felt, you and your companions can
bolster your resistance to that madness. For
each downtime day you spend, you can grant
yourself or an ally a madness ward that lasts
until your next long rest. A creature with this
madness ward can use a reaction to gain
advantage on a saving throw against madness.
A character can have only one madness ward
active at a time.
Lords’ Alliance—Rally the Troops. You are a
Stingblade of the Lords’ Alliance, dedicated to
helping the common folk stand strong against
the demonic influences pouring forth from the
Underdark. By spending ten downtime days to
rally the locals—whether surface dwellers or
Underdark denizens—you can call three
bandits (see appendix B of the Monster
Manual) to your assistance. By spending fifteen
downtime days, you can rally three bandits and
one bandit captain to your aid. These allies
perform any tasks within reason and capability,
but they part ways with you after taking part in
one combat or at the end of the adventure,
whichever comes first. If things are looking grim
and you do not already have these allies (and
have not already called them during the current
adventure), you can use a bonus action to
spend an additional five downtime days (for a
total of fifteen or twenty downtime days) and
have these allies immediately show up in a
place of the Dungeon Master’s choosing.
Zhentarim—Opportunist. You are a Viper of
the Zhentarim and are adept at slithering your
way into advantageous positions. Despite the
Red Plumes’ grip on trade in the region and the
chaos spreading as a result of madness in the
Underdark, you are in a perfect position to profit.
While you adventure, you are able collect
valuables without the other party members’
knowledge, then sell those valuables at a later
date. For each ten downtime days you spend
before an adventure, increase your gold rewards
from the adventure by 10 percent, up to a
maximum of 50 percent for that adventure.

acts, and provide provisions (represented by the
