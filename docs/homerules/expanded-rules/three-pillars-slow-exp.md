# Modified Three Pillar

This version of three pillar experience rewards players for exploration and social interaction, while maintaining the traditional character advancement scale and allowing the GM to reward XP for encounters.

Instead of rewarding a fixed amount, for Exploration and Social Interaction players receive a percentage of the XP required for them to get from their current level to the next \(calculated from the base XP of their level to the next, not including XP they've earned in between.\)

They may receive a higher or lower percentage depending on the their tier of play compared to the magnitude of their accomplishment.   

## Gaining Levels

Players gain levels according to the normal PHB Character Advancement table.

# Exploring

For discovering Items, Locations or Knowledges each player gains 5% for a goal at their tier, 5% additional for every goal from a tier above, none for a goal below their tier.

## Founding of item


\| Tier   \| Goal                                                                          \|

\| 5 \| A single art object or gem worth 5,000 gp or more, or a major very rare item  \|

\| 6 \| A single art object or gem worth 50,000 gp or more, or a major legendary item \|

## Location

A location's tier depends on the importance to your campaign, measured by the scope of its discovery or liberation's impact:

\|  Tier \| Goal                                            \|

\| ----- \| ----------------------------------------------- \|

\| 1     \| A location important to a small town or village \|

\| 3     \| A location vital to a kingdom                   \|

\| 5     \| A location important across the world           \|

\| 6    \| A location of cosmic importance                 \|

## Knowledge

## Riddles, Puzzles or Trap

# Social

## Allied NPC

\|  Tier \| Goal                                                                                     \|

\| ----- \| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \|

\| 1     \| An NPC with influence over a small town or village, or the equivalent                    \|

\| 2     \| An NPC with influence over a city or the equivalent                                      \|

\| 3     \| An NPC with influence over a kingdom, continent, or the equivalent                       \|

\| 4     \| An NPC \(including a deity\) with cosmic significance or influence across multiple worlds. \|

## Role Play

This modified Three Pillar method also rewards players for inter-party role play. The difficulty of inter-party role play should remain fairly constant throughout all tiers of play, so unlike the other categories in this method it is not awarded based on tier. Instead, it is awarded for specific group activities.

When the party interacts in character during a session, each member gains 5%. If the interaction is only partially in character, they gain 2%. If they create a story-changing or divergent moment, they gain an extra 5%.

Here are some examples of these interactions \(obviously party interaction situations are not limited to these\):

* The party argues in character.
* The party comes to a decision in character.
* The party solves a mystery or puzzle in character.
* Some party members conspire to play a trick on another party member
* Some party members confront other party members about a problem or secret.
* The party convinces an NPC to give them information that the NPC previously did not want to give, a significantly lower price on an item, or another form of important help.
* More than half the party gains inspiration or role plays their traits, ideals, bonds, or flaws.
* The party agrees to take a quest from an NPC in need.  

## Social Encounters


# Combat

## Standard Combat

Standard Combat Encounter for XP is Deadly for max level of any of party members and it's give party 5% of XP for next level. If Encounter Difficulty was higher then Max Difficulty of next Tier (1-6), then party get another 5% .

Repeated Encounters can't give any XP if only they haven't Legendary Monster.
