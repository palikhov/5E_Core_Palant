Creature: The name of the creature according to the most recent MM.

Part: The parts of the creature commonly used for other secondary purposes. Some creatures will have many useable parts and others will have few. Creatures with no useable parts are usually incorporeal or disappear upon death.

Most Common Uses: These are the most common uses for the listed part. Alchemy uses are potions, medicine, spells, etc... Trophy use is a common display of power, wealth, or courage. Practical use is defined as all-purpose non-magical products; like standard armor or weapons.

Value: GP value of one useable lot. In a battle, a creature suffers damage across its body. This price represents a unit of useable, undamaged parts. Most dead creatures will only have one lot of each part category. There may be two eyes but the price is for a useable lot of dragon eyes.

DC: This is the difficulty level of harvesting the part. Some parts are extremely difficult to harvest safely and intact. Most of the time this DC is based on DEX but the DM is free to use a different ability. STR may be used to cleave off a Naga head, while DEX would be needed to extract a poison gland.
Notes: A failed DC check will always result in a useless, damaged part. Some parts carry addition risk of injury during their extraction. A harvester can be poisoned, electrocuted, turned to stone, etc...There is no save allowed.
