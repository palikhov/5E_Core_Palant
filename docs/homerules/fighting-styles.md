## Fighting Style

You adopt a particular style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the following options. You canâ€™t take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again. 

### Archery
You gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls you make with ranged weapons. 
### Canny Defense
While not wearing armor, your AC equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Intelligence modifier. You can use shields and still gain this benefit.
### Defense
While you are wearing armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC. 
### Defensive Duelist
While using a one-handed weapon while leaving your off hand completely free (including not holding a shield), any time you are the target of a melee attack you may use your reaction to gain a +2 bonus to your AC until the beginning of your next turn. 
### Dueling
When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon. 
### Great Weapon Fighting
When you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for an attack you make with a melee weapon that you are wielding with two hands, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll, even if the new roll is a 1 or a 2. The weapon must have the two-handed or versatile property for you to gain this benefit. 
### Knife Fighter
Any time you successfully hit with a dagger or knife you deal +2 damage. Additionally, if you have a hand free you may draw up to two daggers as part of any attack. 
### Protection
When a creature you can see attacks a target other than you that is within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on the attack roll. You must be wielding a shield. 
### Pugilist
Your unarmed strike now deals 1d4 + your Strength modifier in bludgeoning damage. As long as you have a free hand, any time you take the Attack action, you can make an unarmed strike as a bonus action.
### Two-Weapon Fighting
When you engage in two-weapon fighting, you can add your ability modifier to the damage of the second attack. Additionally, you can draw or stow two one-handed weapons when you would normally be able to draw or stow one.
