# AEGIS OF ASSAULT

3rd-level conjuration

Casting Time: 1 reaction, which you take when a creature within range hits one of your allies with a melee attack Range: 30 feet

Components: V, M (a weapon)

Duration: 1 round

With a flash of light, you bring instant vengeance to the attacking enemy. As part of the reaction used to cast this spell, you choose to do either one or both of the following:

•	Teleport to an unoccupied space within range, as long as that space is not farther away than you are now from the creature that made the triggering attack.
•	
•	Make one melee weapon attack against the attacker if it is within reach. You can use your spellcasting ability instead of your Strength for the attack and damage rolls of this attack if you choose. If the attack hits, it deals an extra ld4 radiant damage.
•	
If you are unable to do either one, the spell ends. Otherwise, after the triggering attack is resolved, the creature who made that attack has disadvantage on attack rolls against creatures besides you until the end of its next turn.

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the range increases to 60 feet, and the radiant damage increases by ld4 for each slot level above 3rd.

# AEGIS OF ENSNARING

3rd-level enchantment

Casting Time: 1 reaction, which you take when a creature within range hits one of your allies with a melee attack Range: 30 feet

Components: V, M (a weapon)

Duration: 1 round

Your magic ensnares an attacking enemy, compelling it to attack you instead of your ally. The creature that made the triggering attack must roll a Charisma saving throw before that attack is resolved. If it fails, you teleport it to an unoccupied space within 5 feet of you. It then makes the triggering attack against you instead, comparing the same attack roll to your Armor Class to determine whether it hits or misses you.

Whether the saving throw succeeds or fails, after the triggering attack is resolved, the attacking creature takes 1d4 psychic damage and has disadvantage on attack rolls against creatures besides you until the end of its next turn.

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the range increases to 60 feet, and the psychic damage increases by ld4 for each slot level above 3rd. 

# AEGIS OF SHIELDING

3rd-level abjuration

Casting Time: 1 reaction, which you take when a creature within range of you hits one of your allies with a melee attack

Range: 30 feet

Components: V, M (a weapon)

Duration: Instantaneous

You protect your ally with a gleaming barrier of invisible force. Until the end of tire turn, the target of the triggering attack gains resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage, as well as a +5 bonus to AC, including against the triggering attack.

After the triggering attack is resolved (whether it hits or misses), the creature that made the attack takes ld4 force damage and has disadvantage on attack rolls against creatures besides you until the end of its next turn.

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the range increases to 60 feet, and the force damage increases by ld4 for each slot level above 3rd.
