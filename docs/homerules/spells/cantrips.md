As part of the action used to cast this spell, you must make a melee weapon attack against one creature within the spell's range, otherwise the spell fails. On a hit, the target suffers the attack's normal effects, and you exchange a moment of silent, instinctive communication that expresses your personal challenge. Before the beginning of your next turn, the target has disadvantage on the next attack roll it makes that does not target you. Also, if the target willingly moves more than 30 feet away from you 
or makes an attack that suffers disadvantage from this spell, it immediately takes 1d8 psychic damage, and the spell ends.  

This spell's damage increases when you reach higher levels.
