## Базовый подход к изменению маневров

Маневры Арканиса переводим в маневры battlemaster-а из PHB. То же самое делаем с тактическими маневрами Тактика (Tactician из Arcanis Campaign Setting). При этом Тактика вводим как дополнительный архетип.
Resolve dice заменяем на superiority dice.
Уточняем формулировки во избежание разночтений. Сразу прописать RAI толкование.

When you take the Attack action and attack with a melee weapon that you’re holding in one hand, you can use a bonus action to attack with another melee weapon that you’re holding in the other hand. You don’t add your ability modifier to the damage of the bonus attack, unless that modifier is negative. If either weapon has the thrown property, you can throw the weapon, instead of making a melee attack with it.	Dual Wielder feat

You can use two-weapon fighting even when the one-handed melee weapons you are wielding aren't light.

### Commander's Strike
When you take the Attack action on your turn, you can forgo one of your attacks and use a bonus action to direct one of your companions to strike.

### On My Mark
Sometimes it’s best to lead by example. As part of an attack action, you may spend 1 tactical point to grant a single ally within 30 feet who can hear and see you advantage on their next attack roll against the creature you attack. If your ally successfully hits with this attack they deal an additional 1d6 damage. This damage increases to 1d8 when you reach 5th level, 11th level becomes 1d10 and finally, 1d12 at 17th level.

### Strike the Rod
You can put the fear of a training sergeant into your allies, helping them to shake off lesser fears. Whenever one of your allies becomes frightened, as a reaction you can help them regain their composure. You spend 1 tactical point and all friendly creatures within 60 feet who can hear or see you can make a new saving throw to shake off any effect which has resulted in the frightened condition. If the effect that granted the frightened condition does not grant a saving throw, your allies must make a DC: 20 Charisma saving throw to remove the frightened condition.	

### Tempting Target
By making yourself a target for an attack, you force your opponent to overextend, leaving a perfect opening for your allies. When you take the Attack action, you may spend 1 tactical point as a bonus action to force a creature within your reach to make a Wisdom saving throw. If your target fails its saving throw, all friendly creatures who saw the attack gain advantage on their next attack roll against your target. Regardless of the result of the saving throw, if the target attacks anyone other than you during its next turn it suffers disadvantage on their attack roll	

### Warning Shout
You warn your allies to dive for cover! When a friendly creature within 60 feet who can hear and see you is the target of a spell, you can use your reaction to shout a warning to them. You spend 1 tactical point and that creature gains advantage on their saving throw against the triggering spell. If the spell has no save your ally gains resistance against the triggering spell’s damage instead.
