# Research

##  Lore Research

You seek through tomes of lore and folios of letters, collections of journals and the scribbled notes of sages and scholars for some piece of important lore. Each Topic has a given DC - the more obscure the lore, the higher the DC. This DC is what it takes to simply know that fact using a normal Skill check. If no one knows it, then research is necessary. Researchers should add their full Skill bonus to this roll, with additional researchers adding only their Intelligence bonuses.

Everyday Lore \(DC 10\): +15% • 1gp • 1 hour. Lore that even those without any real training are likely to know. Common Lore \(DC 15\): +10% • 1 gp • 1 hour. Common lore among those who are trained in the discipline in question. Uncommon Lore \(DC 20\): +0% • 10 gp • 1 day. Lore known most commonly to those with great knowledge in the discipline. Rare \(DC 25\): -10% • 25 gp • 1 day. Lore considered rare even among the sages of this discipline. Very Rare \(DC 30\): -20% • 50 gp • 3 days. Lore likely to be known only to those at the pinnacle of learning in this discipline. Legendary \(DC 35\): -30% • 100 gp • 5 days. Lore unlikely to be known by even the finest of sages, usually requiring extensive libraries and weeks of research to uncover. d100 Result 10 or lower Failed Research.

## Magical Research 

You engage in extensive research, experimenting with any number of magical principles and theories in an attempt to expand your understanding of the Art. You must choose what you are seeking to research, whether a new spell or the formula of a new magic item. The level of the item being researched imposes a modifier to this roll. In order to research a formula, a researcher must be of the level needed to either learn the spell or create the magic item. Each research roll also costs a base amount to even make the roll at all, though this cost can be modified by the result gained. The researcher adds his total Arcana, Nature, or Religion bonus to these rolls, depending on the item or spell in question.

If you are researching a spell of 4th Level or lower, or a magic item of Rare quality or lower, you succeed at finding the formula. If your goal is higher than that, reduce the cost of this Research roll by 10%, and gain +25 to your next roll. 81-99 Breakthrough Progress.

You succeed at finding the formula you seek, no matter its complexity. Reduce the cost of this Research roll by 50% \[edit\]Rare and Unique Spells The above mechanics assume that the spells being researched are common spells.

Rare Spells: If creating a spell that is unique to a character or organization, or simply rarely discovered or heard of, research rolls gain a -20 penalty to the research roll, reducing the penalty by 5 for every spell level the target spell is below the highest the researcher can cast. Unique Spells: Creating a spell entirely from nothing, based entirely on the researcher's own innovation, is a -30 penalty, reduced by 5 for every spell level the target spell is below the highest the researcher can cast. Additionally, move the time each research roll takes up one step. \[edit\]Magic Items If the researcher actually has in his or her possession an example of a given magic item, reduce the research time at each roll by one step \(one week becomes five days\). Success on this roll results in the creation of a schema, or "formula" for creation of that kind of magic item. Schema take up a number of pages, just like spells do, based on their rarity. Common items take up 1d4+1 pages, Uncommon take up 1d4+3, Rare take up 1d4+5, Very Rare take up 1d4+8, and Legendary take up 1d4+9.

# Learning New Spells

A mage gains access to new spells in one of two ways: he can either research them or he can study spells that he finds. Either of these approaches allow him to understand the spell in question.

## Researching Spells

Automatic Research: As mages advance through their levels, they are assumed to constantly be researching, studying, experimenting and discovering or awakening new magical techniques and understandings. These form a body of ongoing "research". At each level, a mage may add 2 new spells to his spellbook. These spells must come from the list of common spells, or from spells whose formulae the wizard has had a chance to read but not copy.

There is no cost to scribe these spells.

Additional Research: In addition to the normal, ongoing but painstakingly slow research that goes on for most wizards, others also maintain more immediate research projects, as detailed in the Downtime page. Once A Spell is Learned: Once a spell has been successfully researched, it must be immediately scrivened into a spellbook to be prepared.

Even if this doesn't happen immediately, the insights and notes are there: they just have to be set down and codified into something useful.

If more than a week passes between successfully researching the spell and writing down, the mage must make an Intelligence check \(DC 5 + 1 per week that has passed\) and the amount of time needed to scribe the spell. Failure on this roll results in wasted time, and 1d6gp worth of wasted scrivening materials.

## Copying A Spell

The other way to learn new spells is to copy and already-finished formula, whether one that is written out in another mage's spellbook or one that has been imbued onto a spell scroll.

Another's Spell Book: Whether a mentor's spellbook lent for the purpose of copying, or an enemy's taken as a trophy of war, a mage may copy a spell out of another spellbook. This process takes a number of hours equal to the level of the spell in question.

Once this time passes, the mage now knows the spell as though he'd just successfully finished researching it, and can move on to scrivening it in his spellbook. This spell need not be scrivened into the mage's spellbook. If he continues to have access to the written form of the spell he studied already, he may simply prepare the spell from that book, rather than also add it to his own. This is the reason so many mages collect the spellbooks of their foes and end up with vast libraries: it is expensive to both scribe spells, so it is often easier \(and cheaper\) to simply keep the other spellbook on hand to learn from. Many mages will consolidate the best of their trophies' contents into singular traveling spellbooks and the like sometimes.

Spell Scroll: Perhaps the easiest of the methods, it literally takes only a single round and no materials in order to divine the formula of a spell from a spell scroll on which it is written. Using this method does consume the spell scroll as though its spell had been cast, however.

The downside is that there is no room for lolly-gagging - the mage must immediately scribe it into his spellbook. If even an hour passes between the reading of the scroll and the beginning of the scrivening, the spell is lost. Scrivening New Spells

By whatever method is used, once a spell is understood by a mage, he may now copy it into his spellbook.

No roll is involved to do so.

This takes one hour per level of the spell to be added. \(Note that if copying another's spellbook, the hours spent experimenting during that process count as time towards this total.\) This requires the expenditure of 25gp per level of the spell to be added.

Once both these requirements have been met, the spell is added to the character's spellbook.

A newly added spell takes up a number of pages in a text equal to 1d4+level of the spell in pages.

This is halved if the spell is being scribed into a folio, or doubled if being scribed into an octavo.

Spells Cantrips: 30 gp each Higher Level Spells: 50 gp per spell level each A quarto spellbook is the standard for most wizards. They are usually 12 inches in height by 9.5 inches in width. A quarto spellbook can be purchased for 75 gp per 100 pages, with a practical maximum \(in terms of binding strength\) of 300 pages. The page count modifier for the quarto is 100% \(i.e. unmodified\). The so-called "traveling spellbooks" are octavo in size, measuring 9" x 6". These can be purchased for 40 gp per 100 pages, with a practical maximum of 200 pages. The page count modifier for the octavo is 200%. Finally, "sanctum spellbooks" are larger spellbooks - highly impractical to transport, save as cargo - are called folio sized tomes, measuring 15" x 12". These sell for 150 gp per 100 pages, and can be bound in books of up to 500 pages. The page count modifier for the folio is 50%. Covers Basic spellbook prices assume simple leather covers, which are rarely "hard" leather - they tend to be softer leather covers that often tie shut.

Other Leathers: A spellbook covered in "decorative" leathers such as buckskin, fish scale, shark- or snake-skin or goat- or wyvern-hide are possible for an additional 20gp. Those covered in "fine leather" such as dragonscale, eel- or stingray-skin, behir- or bullette-hide, giant snakeskin or displacer beast- or unicorn-hide are also possible, for an additional 40gp. Most of these are hard leather covers, though a skilled craftsman can make them hard or soft as the customer desires. Wood Covers: A spellbook covered in "decorative" woods - such as apple, ash, ebony, hornbeam, oak or many of the more common woods - can be had for an additional 15gp. Covers of rarer woods such as chime oak, laspar, roseneedle pine, shadowtop and similar specimens can be had for 25gp extra. On the other hand, books that are covered in scrap wood \(often untreated and poorly constructed\) reduce the base price of the spellbook by 5%. Metal Covers: Spellbooks covered in "decorative" metals such as brass, bronze, copper, iron, silver or steel cost an additional 35gp. Those bound in electrum, gold, mithral, platinum or a lesser metal treated with everbright or blueshine cost 75gp \(and softer metals such as gold are almost always plating rather than full solid covers, for strength if not cost\).

Adornments

Decorations and other pieces of art may improve the quality of the final book's cost.

Gilding: Silver gilding costs an additional +10% of the Base Cost, while gold gilding on the pages costs an additional +20% of the base cost.

Precious Metal & Gem Accents: This costs the cost of the materials used \(precious metals and gems\), plus an additional 10gp for the design work and incorporation \(5gp for octavos, 20 gp for folios\).

Carvings, Tooling and Other Artwork: This can cost anywhere between 5gp for a simple tooling into leather, carving/burning into wood or etching into metal, all the way to several hundred gold pieces for full cover pieces lovingly wrought by a skilled craftsman.

Practical Additions

Sealing Cover: Only available on wood or metal covered books, the covers are designed so that when the book is closed, portions extend over the pages and fit together, closing like the lid on a box. The fastener easily closes it well, giving it additional resistance to wear and tear. It is also very easy to fit a lock into the cover. This costs an additional 20gp for octavo, 30gp for quarto and 50gp for folio spellbooks.

Key Lock: A lock is set into the cover. If the book does not have the sealing cover addition \(above\), the other end of the locking mechanism is in a strap of leather which extends from the back cover. When locked in place, it is sealed \(the leather is quite difficult to cut without damaging the book\). The key lock's price includes the small lock and a pair of keys that unlock it. These locks are priced according to how difficult they are to pick: 25gp for DC 15, 50gp for DC 20, 100gp for DC 25.

Puzzle Lock: Like the key lock, except in order to unseal it, the lock requires the solving of a strange puzzle made up of grooves and sliding mechanisms that not only require brain power to solve, but make them nigh unpickable \(Lock Picking DC is 5 higher than the DC to solve them\). Anyone who is taught the trick for them gains a +5 to their Intelligence checks to open it. Each attempt to open the lock takes 30 minutes \(or 5 minutes for those who've been taught the lock solution\). These locks are priced according to how difficult they are to solve: 35gp for DC 15, 70gp for DC 20, 150gp for DC 25.

Enchantments

Certain priesthoods or wizards can enact these enchantments.

Minor Properties: A spellbook imbued with a Minor Property. This costs an additional 150gp.

Beacon: Bearer can use a bonus action to cause the item to shed bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet, or to extinguish the light.

Compass: The bearer can use an action to learn which way is north.

Conscientious: When the bearer of this item contemplates or undertakes a malevolent act, the item enhances pangs of conscience.

Delver: While underground, the bearer always knows the item's depth beneath the surface and direction to the nearest staircase, ramp, or other path leading upward.

Diplomatic: Bearer gains the ability to speak, read, write, and understand a language.

Gleaming: The item never gets dirty or scuffed.

Guardian: Item whispers warnings to its bearer, granting a +2 bonus to initiative if the bearer isn't incapacitated.

Hidden Message: A message is hidden somewhere on the item. It might be visible only at a certain time of the year, under the light of one phase of the moon, or in a specific location.

Illusion: The item is imbued with illusion magic, allowing its bearer to alter the items appearance in minor ways. The item reverts to its true appearance when no one is carrying or wearing it

Key: The item is used to unlcok a container, chamber, vault, or other entryway.

Sentinel: Faintly glows when creatures of a certain race are within a 100 foot radius.

Song Craft: When this item is struck or used to strike a foe, its bearer hears a figment of an ancient song.

Temperate: Bearer suffers no harm in temperature as cold as -20 degrees Fahrenheit or as warm as 120 degrees Fahrenheit.

Unbreakable: The item cannot be broken, requiring special means to break it.

War Leader: Bearer may choose to amplify voice to be heard up to 300 feet clearly.

Waterborne: This item floats on water and other liquids. Bearer gains advantage on Strength \(Athletics\) checks to swim.

Wicked: When the bearer is presented with an opportunity to act in a selfish or malevolent way, the item heightens the bearer's urges to do so.

Arcane Locking: With a command word, the book seals as though by an arcane lock spell. The same word unseals it. \(Unless a book has a lock or sealable cover built into it, it cannot normally be affected by arcane lock.\) 250gp

Arcane Words: When the book is opened, words speak aloud, emanating from the book. This can happen everytime, or only if a command word is either spoken or not spoken. The words and volume \(from a whisper audible only to the one who opens it to the loudness of a large-lunged man shouting\) are chosen when it is enchanted. \(50gp\)

Immunity: The book is immune to damage of one type entirely. \(100gp + 50gp per additional damage type\)

Illusory Appearance: With a command word, the book can be made to look like another book entirely. The cheapest such enchantments make it look like a single alternate appearance, but more expensive ones can cause it to look like any other sort of book the one who speaks the word imagines, or even any inanimate object of roughly similar size. \(Single Appearance 100gp, Variable Appearance 200gp, Mutable Appearance 400gp\)

Levitating: When opened, the book can be commanded to simply hover in place, allowing the reader to work with both hands and still consult the book. This costs an additional 75gp.

# Running a Business

Successfully running a business means having the right people and putting time into the work done.

## Business Costs

The cost to run a business is made up of four things: Owner's Lifestyle + Employee Costs + Building Costs + Goods Cost

Owner's Lifestyle: A business of a given Lifestyle quality is assumed to cover as part of its expenses the Lifestyle costs of its owner - it is rather part of the point of running a business. Employee Costs: A business must have workers in order to run. Skilled workers cost 2gp per day \(60 gp per month\) and Unskilled workers cost 2sp per day \(6 gp per month\). Building Costs: If the business owner does not own the building in which he operates his business, he must also pay a rent. This is a monthly fee. Size of Floor, per Floor: Small \(10gp\) • Medium \(25gp\) • Large \(50gp\)

Business Costs Skilled Hirelings Unskilled Hirelings Goods Base Cost Farm 1 2 2gp Festhall 2 10 100gp Guildhall 5 3 5gp Inn, rural 5 10 30gp Inn, civic 1 5 80gp School 5 5 5gp Service, specialized 0 2 15gp Shop 1 0 100gp Tavern 1 5 25gp Temple, large 10 10 30gp Temple, small 2 0 5gp Trading outpost 4 2 30gp

Establishing a Business \(Downtime Action\) Setting up a business is a Downtime Action as well. This requires that the Business Cost of the business be calculated first. This is then used to establish the time and coin needed to Establish the business.

Time: Roll 1d4 per Skilled Worker the business must start with, and add +1 per Non-Skilled Worker to this total. If the Business runs at Squalid or Poor, halve this time. If the Business runs at Wealthy, double it. Coin: The cost to establish a business is one-half of its Monthly Cost. Once both time and coin are spent establishing the business, the business is open.

The Business Roll Business Roll: On the last day of each month, a business owner may make a business roll. A Direct Hand \(Bonus\): This gains a +1 per day of downtime the character dedicated to working on the business exclusively. Other characters may also lend help, granting a +1 per two days of dedicated assistance. Insufficient Employees \(Penalty\): If you do not have the proper number of employees to run your business, you gain a -1 to the roll per Unskilled missing, and -5 per Skilled. If you have Unskilled employees covering Skilled roles, that penalty becomes a -2 per Skilled employee missing. Skilled employees can easily cover Unskilled roles, however. Plentiful Employees \(Bonus\): If you have more employees than you need, your business can run more smoothly. For Skilled employees, gain a +2 if you hire more than you need; this becomes a +5 if you double the requirements or more. For Unskilled employees, gain a +1 if you hire more than you need; this becomes a +3 if you double the requirements or more. Advertising \(Bonus\): Hiring criers and putting up printed leaflets for your business can provide a boost. For each 1 gp you spend on doing so \(to a maximum of 3 gp\), you may add +1d4-1% to your roll. It is possible \(though rare\) for this to generate a negative number, the result of bad timing, lazy criers, and the like. Other Events \(Bonus or Penalty\): Other events occurring in or around your business can affect how it runs. Bonuses include city festivals, booking excellent entertainers, one's services or products becoming in fashion, and the like. Penalties can include violence or damage to the business, smear campaigns against your business, seasons where your services are less in demand, and the like. Quality: Each business is given a Quality, which describes at what Lifestyle most of their customers exist. It is easier to make coin on cheaper business ventures, but one can make larger profits. Squalid: Base cost of business is reduced by 50%. Gain a +10% to the Running a Business roll. Reduce any profit by 50%. Poor: Base cost of business is reduced by 25%. Gain +5% to the Running a Business roll. Reduce any profit by 25%. Modest: Profit, Running a Business roll and profits are normal. Comfortable: Base cost of business is increased by 50%. Gain -5% to the Running a Business roll. Increase any profit by 50%. Wealthy: Base cost of business is increased by 100%. Gain -10% to the Running a Business roll. Increase any profit by 100%. d100 roll Result 01-20 Disastrous Month: You must pay 150% of business's Total Business Costs for the month. 21-30 Hard Month: You must pay 100% of the business's Total Business Costs for the month. 31-40 Difficult Month: You must pay 50% of the business's Total Business Costs for the month. 41-60 Fair Month: The business covers its own Business Costs for the month. 61-80 Good Month: The business covers its own Business Costs for the month. You also earn a Profit of 1d6x5 gp. 81-90 Excellent Month: The business covers its own Business Costs for the month. You also earn a Profit of 2d8x5 gp. 91+ Windfall Month: The business covers its own Business Costs for the month. You also earn a Profit of 3d10x5 gp.

## Criminal Businesses

Business Costs Skilled Hirelings Unskilled Hirelings Goods Base Cost Burglary 1 0 10gp Drug Trade 1 5 100gp Fencing 2 10 50gp Smuggling 3 0 25gp Gang of Pickpockets 1 5 10gp Thugs & Legbreakers 1 2 5gp Criminal businesses can be more profitable, but can also result in being discovered by the law or running afoul of rivals.

Profits: Double the normal profits if a business is a criminal enterprise.

Dealing with the Law As a criminal enterprise goes through its business, it attracts the attention of the law.

Law Rating: Each neighborhood has a Law Rating, rated 1 - 100. Legal Attention: Each business has a running tally of how much attention it has garnered from the law. On each Running a Business check, add the result of the 1's die \(before modifiers\) to the business's accrued Law Results. Legal Reprisal Check: When a given business's Legal Attention rating exceeds the Law Rating of the neighborhood in question, it triggers a Legal Reprisal - roll on the chart below. Add the following modifiers to the check, based on the profitability of the business: Poor \(-20\), Moderate \(-10\), Comfortable \(+0\), Wealthy \(+10\), Aristocratic \(+20\) Reducing Legal Attention Rating: A character may spend active efforts to reduce the amount of legal attention his criminal enterprise is earning by one of two ways: subtlety and bribes. Subtlety: This scaling back the operation, increasing security, and being more subtle. The criminal chooses how much to reduce his Legal Attention rating by, and on his next Running a Business roll, he reduces his die roll by the same amount. Bribes: At any given time, the criminal may enact bribes to the Watch, as long as he has a Contact with the Watch, has Information Network \(Defense\), or has a Secret of knowing who in the Watch to bribe. With this, the criminal may pay a certain amount of gold and roll to reduce the amount of Legal Attention: for every 5gp paid out in bribes, the criminal may reduce the Legal Attention by 1d4. The price of the bribe is subject to a multiplier based on the Quality of the Business: Squalid \(x.25\) • Poor \(x.5\) • Modest \(x1\) • Comfortable \(x2\) • Wealthy \(x4\) Legal Reprisals

Roll Result 00-20 None: Rumors trickle about, but the Watch finds nothing worth investigating about you. 21-40 Peaked Interest: Investigations reveal enough to spark interest. Double Legal Attention gains for the next 1d6 checks. 41-55 Active Investigation: The law begins taking a closer look at your affairs. Gain +10 on your next Legal Reprisals check. 56-70 Special Interest: The law is fairly certain it has something worth noting on you. Gain +20 on your next Legal Reprisals roll, and double your Legal Attention gains for 1d6 months. 71-85 Interrogation: You are wanted for questions by the Watch. They begin looking to bring you in. 86-100 Arrests: You are wanted for arrest by the Watch. 100+ Raid!: Your operation is raided by the Watch.

Dealing with Rivals As a criminal enterprise grows and is successful, it attracts the envy of enemies and rivals. Each time a criminal business generates a profit, make a Rival Reprisal check.

Money Makers: Reduce rolls by -15% for Poor businesses, -5% for Modest businesses, +0% for Comfortable businesses, +10% for Wealthy businesses, and +20% for Aristocratic businesses. Dealing with Rivals \(Downtime Action\): For each day a character deals with rivals, reduce the check by 2%. Leery of the Law: Legal Attention can sometimes cause rivals to step more carefully, reducing Rival Reprisal checks.

# Establish Information Network

A character may cultivate an information network as a downtime action, deliberately seeking to find those who are either sympathetic or willing to take coin in order to provide the character with information. Networks are rated in size encompassed, from Neighborhood to Regional. Once a network is established \(at Neighborhood size\), the character can continue to expand that network. Each stage has a threshold of both time and gold necessary to get it to a given level. When work begins on a network by a PC, the DM should roll to determine what these thresholds are, but not reveal this information to the player. Taking this action, then involves investing both downtime and coin towards these goals, hoping to increase the size and utility of a given network.

* **Small:** Your network covers a small village or a single neighborhood in a larger community \(i.e. the Old Temple neighborhood\).
* **Modest:** Your network covers a town or a single district within a larger community \(i.e. the Castle Ward\). It can also encompass several villages across a wider area.
* **Large:** Your network covers the whole of a major city, or several towns and villages across a larger area.

# Utilize Information Network

Information networks serve a single purpose: to provide a source of information. Acquiring this involves "chasing down" your contacts, setting them to the task of what you're looking for, and then waiting to see what they bring back to you. This involves a roll on the following table, with the following modifiers:

* **Time:** For each day less than a tenday of chasing leads \(-1% per day less than 10\)
* **Size:** Small \(-10%\) • Modest \(+0%\) • Large \(+10%\)
* **Coin Spent:** Inquiries cost 1d10 gp \(x.5 for Small, x2 for Large\).
  * For each gp spent below this, gain -1%. For each gp spent above it, gain +1% \(max +10%\)
* **Specific Info:** If you are seeking specific information, there is a chance your network might discover it. This is considered a Secret, but your network takes a modifier based on the scale of the Secret: +10% for Minor Secrets • +0% for Moderate Secrets • -10% for Major Secrets
  * Minor Secrets: These secrets are considered embarrassing or personal. They do not endanger either life or social standing, but knowledge of them can be a source of embarrassment.
  * Moderate Secrets: These secrets are considered scandalous or devastating. They do not endanger the life or freedom of the one they are about, but they do threaten his social standing.
  * Major Secrets: These secrets are considered dangerous or illegal. Open knowledge of them could result in danger to the one the secret is about.

| d100 roll | Result |
| :--- | :--- |
| Below 20 | **False Information:** Bad information is passed to you, whether deliberately by an upset informant or fed to your network by someone scheming. You gain a Rumor and a Secret, but the Secret is false or incorrect. |
| 21-30 | **Lost Informants:** You do something to lose informants - get them killed, chased from the city, or placed under close scrutiny such that they cannot help you any more. Either way, you lose 2d10 days and 2d10 gp from your Required Time and Required Gold Pieces investments. |
| 31-40 | **Upset Informants:** You do something that causes your informants to become upset with you - embarrassing them, revealing their identities, etc. You lose 1d6 days and 1d6 gp from your Required Time and Required Gold Pieces investments. |
| 41-50 | **Nothing Useful:** You don't get any real useful information from your informants. |
| 51-65 | **Scuttlebutt:** You gain a Rumor. |
| 66-85 | **Of Interest:** You gain two Rumors. |
| 86+ | **Secrets:** You gain 1d3 Rumors and a Secret. |

## Sow Network Rumors (Downtime Action)

If you have an information network, you can direct them to spread a rumor. This mimics the "Sowing Rumors" downtime action, except that the network itself takes the time to spread it, without you having to do anything during that time yourself. This still takes the normal amount of time and cost, but frees you up to do other things. You must simply spend 1 day establishing the rumor with your people.

## Types of Information Networks



 Sources of information can be extremely valuable. Entire groups often know things that any given individual might not. The exact nature of the information is usually based on the make-up of the group: street and criminal contacts usually know what's going on in the shadows, while noble contacts are aware of happenings in the aristocratic sphere. Some kinds of information networks available:

Bureaucratic: This category relates to the bureaucratic and judicial operations of the city, from low-level clerks to the doings of the Magistrates and Masked Lords. 

Criminal: This category relates to the activities of the city's criminal world, from low-level pickpockets to gangs to fences, usurists, and criminal compacts. 

Diplomatic: This category relates to the city's interactions with other nations and city-states, and the governments thereof. 

Defense: This category relates to both the city Watch and Guard, and to their inner workings as well as what activities and events that concern them at the moment. 

Mercantile: This category touches on the doing of industry and mercantile life, including information about the Guilds as well. 

Nightlife: This category covers events at the myriad nightlife locations in the city, from taverns to inns to festhalls, as well as theaters, artistic performances, festivals and similar events. 

Racial: This category covers information about one of the peoples of the city - dwarves, elves, and other demihumans - who do not make up the majority of the population. 

Religious: This category covers information about things going on in temples and in religious life in the city in general. 

Street: This category covers the rough lives of a city's populace, from beggars and the homeless to those who simply work hard for poor earnings.

## The Rewards of Information

There are two core rewards gained through the use of information networks: secrets and rumors.

* **Secrets:** These are core pieces of vital information, as assured as any whispered lore can be. They are usually valuable and immediately useful, either revealing pertinent information of use to one, or at least to someone else \(which can then be sold\).
* **Rumors:** Rumors are more common and less assured. They may hint at interesting events, warn of future occurrences, suggest strange goings-on or simply tell of current events that may be manipulated for one's gain. They are far less reliable, and rumors tend to be worth nothing in coin \(although it's not uncommon to trade rumors among one's fellows\).
