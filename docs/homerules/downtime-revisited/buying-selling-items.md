# 1. Buying and Selling Items

## 1.1. Mundane Items

## 1.2. Finding a mundane item

It is assumed that finding a mundane item is quite easy, so no checks are required.

The availability of a mundane item is determined by the size of the settlement, however. Settlements may not have the economy required to sell mundane items above a certain price, and it may be impossible to for players to sell items above a particular price in that settlement because of a lack of funds or demand. Availability is determined by the item's base price in the WotC books, with limits detailed in the table below.

Additionally, settlements will turn away players who seek to spend more gold than a particular amount, because it will destroy the local economy. This is detailed in the Purchase Limit in the table below.

Settlement Item Availability & Purchase Limit

Settlement Size Availability Price Limit Purchase Limit

Thorpe 50 gp 500 gp

Hamlet 200 gp 1,000 gp

Village 500 gp 2,500 gp

Small town 1,000 gp 5,000 gp

Large town 2,000 gp 10,000 gp

Small city 4,000 gp 25,000 gp

Large city 8,000 gp 50,000 gp

Metropolis 16,000 gp 100,000 gp

(See p.34 of the CEM) All mundane items with additional special properties added on to them are considered "Masterwork" Items. The base item is priced as a mundane item with an additional price for each masterwork property.

## 1.3. Magic Items

---

### 1.3.1. Finding a magic item

The availability of magic items for sale is determined by the settlement size. Additionally, buyers in settlements will only buy items up to the local availability. In the table below, the percent chance of a magic item of that rarity being available in that settlement size is listed. To determine if an item is available, roll a percentile die. If the number rolled is at or below the percentage, it is available.

Magic Item Local Availability by Settlement Size

Size Minor, Common Minor, Uncom Major, Uncom Minor, Rare Major, Rare Minor,

Vry Rare Major,

Vry Rare Minor, Legend Major, Legend

Thorpe 50% 25% - - - - - - -

Hamlet 75% 45% 25% - - - - - -

Village 80% 55% 45% 25% - - - - -

Sm Town 85% 65% 55% 35% 25% - - - -

Lg Town 90% 75% 65% 45% 35% 25% - - -

Sm City 95% 85% 75% 55% 45% 35% 25% - -

Lg City 95% 95% 85% 65% 55% 45% 35% 5% -

Metro 100% 95% 95% 75% 65% 55% 45% 25% 5%

Even if an item is available in a settlement, first the PC must make an Intelligence or Wisdom (Arcana) check to determine if they know about the item at all, and second the PC must be able to find the item.

In settlements of size "Small town" or smaller, the PC is assumed to be able to find any item that is available. For any larger settlement, the PC must make an Intelligence or Charisma (Investigation) check to determine if they can find the item. The DC of these checks relies on the rarity of the item, as detailed in the table below. The DC of the investigation check may be modified by local culture and economy at the GM's discretion.

Magic Item Knowledge & Investigation DCs

Rarity Difficulty Class

Common 5

Minor, Uncommon 8

Major, Uncommon 10

Minor, Rare 12

Major, Rare 15

Minor, Very Rare 17

Major, Very Rare 20

Minor, Legendary 22

Major, Legendary 25

Artifact 30

Looking for a special item takes time. Any time a PC makes a successful Investigation check to find an item, it takes 2 hours to find the item. Each shopping day is 8 hours long (assuming normal business hours.) Other PCs may aide the PC in their search to give them advantage on the check, but that consumes 2 hours of the aiding PC's shopping time as well.

### 1.3.2. Buying a magic item

Magic items prices are quoted according to their rarity, along with some degree of randomness, and the local economy. Usually items are more expensive in cities, and less expensive in small towns. The asking price is halved for consumables.

Magic Item Price by Rarity (in gold pieces)

Rarity Range Avg Asking Price\*

(Low is 75%, High is 125%)

Common 50 - 100 50 + 1d50

Minor, Uncommon 101 - 300 100 + 1d200

Major, Uncommon 301 - 500 300 + 1d200

Minor, Legendary 25,001 - 37,500 25000 + 1d12500

Major, Legendary 37,501 - 50,000 37500 + 1d12500

## 1.4. Haggling

### 1.4.1. Buying

1. Either the NPC or the PC proposes a starting price. NPC will propose the local asking price.

a. The NPC has an undisclosed minimum price, and will not sell below that price. This is 75% of the lowest possible local asking price.

2. The PC makes a Charisma or Wisdom (Persuasion) check and optionally role plays their argument for a lower price.

a. The DC of this check is determined as follows, assuming that mundane items have a local availability of 100%:

Base DC 10 + NPC's Wisdom Modifier + Local Availability Modifier (10 - Local Availability % rounded down / 10)

3. The DC is lowered by 2 for good role playing, or 5 for outstanding role playing.

4. For each point the PC beats the DC, the NPC will offer a compromise of a 5% discount on the asking price. If that brings the price down to or below the PC's requested price, the NPC makes the deal. A nat 20 adds a 10% discount.

5. If the PC chooses to counter-offer, rinse and repeat, but the DC of each successive counter-offer increases by 2.

### 1.4.2. Selling

1. The PC or the NPC proposes a starting price. NPC will propose the local offered price.

a. The NPC has an undisclosed maximum price, and will not buy above that price. This is 85% of the highest possible asking price.

2. The PC makes a Charisma or Wisdom (Persuasion) check and optionally role plays their argument for a higher price.

a. The DC of this check is determined as follows, assuming that mundane items have a local availability of 100%:

Base DC 15 + NPC's Wisdom Modifier - Local Availability Modifier

3. The DC is lowered by 2 for good role playing or 5 for outstanding role playing.

4. For each point the PC beats the DC, the NPC will offer a 5% increase on the starting price. If that brings the price up to or above the PC's requested price, the NPC makes the deal. A nat 20 adds a 10% increase.

5. If the PC chooses to counter-offer, rinse and repeat, but the DC of each successive counter-offer increases by 2.
