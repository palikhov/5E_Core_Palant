## Intelligent Creatures

Intelligent creatures are creatures that have a value of Intelligence of 6 or more. If such a creature is used as a mount, it acts independetly and can also attack as one of it's actions, as stated in the official rules. Intelligent creatures are independent creatures. Indeed there can be communication between the creature and it's master, however the creatures acts independently and thus have a turn of their own. This applies to also to riden mounts. These creatures are controlled by the DM. 

{% hint style="info" %}
NOTE: The only exception for this rule is the mount from the Find Steed spell. Due to the nature of the spell, that mount is controlled by the PC. Whether intelligent or not, each creature is still a beast at heart. It might disagree with the rider going in a certain direction such as jumping great heights. The DM might ask the PC to make a particular check whether to remain mounted or maybe the creature just runs off. 
{% endhint %}

Intelligent creatures might challange their master more then non-intelligent creatures, especially when the mount is being asked to do something that might hard for it, it considers dangerous or maybe something that it fears. 

## Death of a Mount or Companion 

Mounts roll for death saves. A dead mount can be resurrected if the requirements for a ressuraction spell are met. This applies also the companion creatures. Potions Potions and other consumables work as intended even on mounts. But so do the harmful effects of negative potions and poisons. 

## Owned Stable Creatures in Sessions 

As your character is represented by a character sheet so are animal companions. Whenever you purchase a mount a character sheet is provided to you by the stable keeper DM. If you acquire a mount by different means then you should discuss it with the stable keeper DM and a character sheet will be drawn for your mount. During a session the player has to control the mount's token the same way he does with his own PC. Any action that the mount does also has to be stated by the PC. The DM will treat the mount as if it was another PC. This is required for companion creatures as well. 

## Companion Needs 

Just like a normal PC, mounts and pets have basic needs. They need: Food and Water to survive Rest after a long day To breathe Someone to take care of them Food and Water is either brought along before the adventure started or else it can be scavanged while in session. Most of the time it will be easy for the mount to be sustained while on an adventure, however some enviroments \(such as deserts or frozen landscapes\) will make it very hard and might possibly starve your mount. Normal exhaustion rules apply if a mount is not sustained. 

Food and Water Needs 

| Creature Size | Food per Day | Water per Day |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Tiny  |   1/4 pound |   1/4 gallon |
| Small  |  1 pound | 1 gallon |
|   Medium | 1 pound |  1 gallon |
| Large  | 4 pounds  |   4 gallons |
| Huge | 16 pounds  | 16 gallons  |
| Gargantuan  | 64 pounds |   64 gallons |

Official Ruling from the D&D Player's Handbook 5e 

Resting after a long day is a big must if you want your mount to remain healthy. They will suffer normal exhaustion effects if they fail to rest or are being pushed over the limit. Breathing is a rather obvious need. Depending on the nature of the mount, different mounts can breathe in different enviroments and cannot in others. Sometime a PCs has to leave his mount behind if the mount cannot breathe in a certain enviroment he wants to explore. This takes us to the following need. Someone to take care of the mount is needed, especially if the mount is not Intelligent. As discussed before, most of the time the PC has to provide nurishment for his mount. If in danger, the PC needs to protect his mount. Most mounts cannot really fend of for themselves but are a very valuable asset when guided by someone. All of the above applies also for companion creatures. In town, adventurer owned mounts and beasts can be left at the stables were all their needs will be looked after. Stables are discussed in the next chapter.

## Riding a mount with no saddle 

No saddle while mounting means that both the beast and the rider and uncomforable. The rider does not have anything that supports him on his mount. Any check done by the PC to remain mounted is done at a disadvantage. Any attack preformed by the PC will be at a disadvantage. While in combat, the rider has to perform a check to remain mounted if the mount moves and the rider does any other action other then try keep steady

## Combat Mechanics 

In this section we are going to discuss the combat mechanics of a mounted PC and his mount. 

### Mount Actions in Combat 

A non-intelligent mount can take three different types of actions in combat, while an intelligent one can also attack. 

#### Dash. 

A mount can take this action to move twice his normal movement speed. 

#### Disengage. 

When disengaging a mount can move without triggering attacks of opportunity. \(Homebrew\) The rider will still provoke an attack of opportunity.\* 

#### Dodge. 

The mount can take the dodge action as normal PC or NPCs can. However, only creatures attacking the mount itself will get disadvantage on attack rolls and only the mount will get advantage on Dexterity saving throws. The rider is not affected. 

### Area of Effect on Mounted Creatures 

When a mounted PC and his mount are inside the Area of Effect of a spell or effect, the rider can be affected too. If HALF the squares that make up the mount's token are inside the are of effect, and that effect affects in a 3D spectrum \(not only the ground\), then both rider and mount are effected. 

### Ranged Attacks while Mounted 

Riders doing ranged attacks while mounted will have disadvantage on the attack roll. This also applies to both ranged weapon attacks and ranged spell attacks.

### Animal Handling 

Animal handling is a vital skill when it comes to mounts. A rider needs to be good with animals if it wants to ride one. If a character does not have proficiency in Animal Handling, all rolls related to keeping control of the mount and related will be at a flat DISADVANTAGE, no matter all the other roll modifiers. You still get the +/- modifier related to Animal Handling.

Note: A mount summoned by SUMMON STEED does not require proficiency in animal handling since the nature of the spell. 

### Keeping Control of the Mount 

At the start of every turn, a mounted creature has to succeed a DC 10 Animal Handling check. This check is straight forward. If the character has proficiency in Animal Handling then he rolls with advantage. If the character does not have Animal Handling, he rolls with disadvantage. If he fails the Animal Handling check then he must succeed DC 10 Dexterity saving throw \(modifiers from saddle's apply\) otherwise he will be knocked prone 5ft away from the mount and take 1d6 bludgeoning damage. The mount will dash as far as possible away from it's rider. That will be the end of the rider's turn. If the rider succeeds the Dexterity saving throw, he will land on his feet 5ft next to the mount. He will still have his turn, but the mount will still be spooked off.

## Melee Reach 

Mounted combat adds a 3 Dimenstional element to combat. Every creature has his own height. If you ride on top of a creature, you are standing on that creauture's back, hench elevated from the ground by that creature's height. Each mount has a height value stated in it's character sheet. That value is the distance the rider is standing above the ground when riding the said mount. 

Mounted character melee weapon without "REACH" attribute:

Mount Size Cannot hit 

Medium None 

Large Tiny or smaller 

Huge Medium or smaller 

Gargantum Large or smaller 

Colossal Gargantum or smaller

Mounted character melee weapon with "REACH" attribute: 

Mount Size Cannot hit 

Medium None 

Large None 

Huge Medium or smaller 

Gargantum Large or smaller 

Colossal Gargantum or smaller 

Note: These melee range restrictions also apply when a creature of the stated size wants to attack the rider who is standing on a mount.

For example a medium or smaller sized creature, wielding a melee weapon without the 'Reach' attribute, cannot hit the rider of a Huge or bigger mount.

# BATTLE FORMATIONS

Battle formations are specific combat maneuvers and positioning which grants some benefits or hindraces on the battlefield. From the simple circle formation to the complex testudo, all of them require coordination and some training to be performed. Every formation requires an Intelligence check to be performed, assigned by the DM, that can be done by the commanding officer or by the lowest intelligence member if the group is improvised. A failed check wastes the action and movement of the entire group. A long standing military unit has advantage to the formation, and a newly formed one or one composed by chaotic-aligned creatures has disadvantage to the roll. New Skill: Military training. A character with this skill can apply its proficiency bonus to Intelligence checks made to direct or teach a formation, train people in basic units, recall lore about fortifications, strategy and battle tactics or about ranks and offices in an army. This skill can be learned by Fighters, Paladins and Bards, or people with the Soldier, Noble or Knight backgrounds.

## Arrow Volley 

Difficulty: Easy

If at least ten archers are in the same line, they can release a high, arcing volley of arrows as an action. Rather than aiming at a specific target, they concentrate their arrows in an area, striking anything here. The creatures under an arrow volley must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity Save or being struck by 1d6 arrows which deal their normal damage without Dexterity modifiers. A testudo formation or a high shield wall protect as normal. Because they fire in a high arc, they can ignore any form of horizontal cover, such as horizontal shield walls or trenches. 

## Cavalry Charge 
Difficulty: Average 
Cavalry charges are shock tactics. A cavalry charge starts with a dash from the horses with a polearm such as a lance automatically wins initiative, and makes an attack when enters in its weapon’s reach. If it hits, the weapons doubles the damage dice \(EG: a lance in a cavalry charge deals 2d12+str. modifier piercing damage\) and the target must succeed on a Strength Saving Throw or being knocked prone and trampled by the mount. If more than half the cavalry units succeed on trampling their targets, it is considered a successful charge, and the enemy formations are broken. The targets must succeed a DC 15 to 20 \(if the cavalry is at about the same number of the defenders) Wisdom saving throw or being Frightened and flee of the battlefield.

The cavalry charge needs relatively flat, featureless terrain and cannot be performed on a difficult terrain, such as going up a hill or a forested plain. Also, infantry units can prepare for a cavalry charge if they have reach weapons and a disciplined formation such as a phalanx. If the phalanx readies an action to engage, they act first and the charging cavalry takes double damage and must succeed a Strength saving throw or being dismounted and knocked prone. 


## Cavalry Dash

Difficulty: Average A cavalry dash can be done only by trained horsemen and mounts. A cavalry dash has the same effects as any dash action, and doubles the movement of the mount. Any action with an area of effect (such as an arrow volley or  fireball) requires an Intelligence check with a DC of 8 + 1 for every 10 feet covered dashed or fail. This way, a warhorse cavalry moving 120 feet has a DC of 20. Also, even when the check is successful, the cavalry gains Advantage in dexterity saving throws. 

## Circle/Square Formation

Difficulty: Easy Creatures on a circle formation move at half speed but cannot be flanked. It is one of the easiest defensive formations. Line Difficulty-Very Easy The line is the base formation. Creatures in a line don’t hinder each other’s attacks and can focus fire and prepare to receive a charge. The main advantage of the line is its difficulty to be flanked, the protection of the rear ranks and the possibility to focus fire effectively. A line can move at their standard movement, Parthian Circle Difficulty: Average A Parthian Circle is a fast archer’s cavalry formation. The cavalry can use a reaction to move up to their horses’ speed when an enemy tries to approach to melee range or use a spell. Also, enemy projectiles have disadvantage to reach the formation. 

## Phalanx

Difficulty: Hard

As an action, a phalanx formation crams several creatures in a tight polearm formation at the cost of speed and attack capability. A phalanx reduces the movement speed by half, but allows cramming twice as much fighters in the same space. The phalanx must attack with polearms or spears, or do it at disadvantage. Any creature attacking frontally a phalanx does it at disadvantage, and automatically provokes opportunity attacks from anyone on reach if it doesn’t take the Disengage action. A phalanx can be combined with a shield wall or testudo for maximum defensive effectivity. 

## Shield Wall

Difficulty: Easy Anyone on the front rank of a shield wall has all the benefits of half cover; anyone in the second rank has three-quarters cover, and anyone beyond that has total cover. This formation reduces the speed of the creatures forming it in 10 feet, and attacks from weapons without a long shaft \(like spears or battleaxes\) are made at disadvantage. If the creatures pass the Saving Throw, they receive no damage from effects that require a Dexterity saving throw. Use: This is an effective formation to minimize the effects of area of effect spells, such as fireballs, as the first ranks may fall, but the second and third don’t. 

## Skirmish Formation 

Difficulty: Easy 

If the soldiers in a formation are concerned about large area effects, they sometimes advance at their speed every round and then ready an action to disperse if they hear the warning. When a formation disperses, the soldiers as a reaction can move up to their speed away from the center of the formation, and everyone else moves to a space not adjacent to any other soldier. This dispersal can help to reduce the casualties from a catapult or ballistae projectile or a powerful area of effect spell, such as a fireball. Even if they are in the center of the effect, the creatures have advantage in Dexterity saving throws as they are prepared to receive the spell, as if they had taken the Dodge action, although none of the other benefits applies. The main disadvantage of this practice is that tight groups of soldiers, such as a line formation, have advantage against the dispersed formation. Creatures in a very close formation, such as a phalanx, have disadvantage in the formation check. 

## Total Cover 

Difficulty:Average 
As an action, a group of creatures with shields spends all its movement and form an improved shield wall which grants total cover and advantage on Strength saves in one direction. A group in total cover cannot attack, automatically fails Dexterity saving throws and has disadvantage on Wisdom \(Perception\) checks that rely on sight. If the creatures already are in a shield wall formation, it only takes a reaction to form it. Use: The Total Cover is the poor man’s testudo formation, as it doesn’t need as much training to use. Creatures with proficiency on shields can use it at a command to protect themselves against projectiles. 

## Testudo 

Difficulty Very Difficult 

Trained creatures can spend an action to perform a testudo \(a bonus action if they are already in a phalanx or shield wall formation\). This formation consists on several creatures to form a close formation akin to the shield wall, but with a “roof” of shields too. Creatures under a testudo have total cover against any ranged attack or spell, and the same benefits of a shield wall against melee attacks or spells. Creatures inside a testudo halve their speed, and their attacks are made at disadvantage. Use: The testudo formation is the most effective defensive formation, but it has its weakness: it is very slow, and it is very easy to flank. Also, as the maneuver is highly coordinated, it is impossible to use it without proper training and coordination \(such as a soldier background, military training or the fighter class\): only professional soldiers such as hobgoblins can use it. Chaotic creatures are impossible to coordinate, and neutral creatures form a testudo in twice the normal time. Besides, creatures in a testudo formation have problems to attack enemy formations. Besides, a testudo can be easily broken by massive solid projectiles, such as a catapult’s fire, a ballista missile or a giant’s rock. Against such weapons, the soldiers forming the testudo automatically fail any dexterity saving throw. 

## Wedge

Difficulty: Average 

A wedge formation is used primarily for attack other formations. A wedge formation consists on a reinforced center to break the enemy lines and two “wings” to prevent being outflanked. The wedge has advantage against static or line formations on the first attack. Also, the units moving inside an enemy formation don’t provoke opportunity attacks from them. Use: This formation is usually used by heavy cavalry but also by heavy infantry to engage against enemy lines. Its main weakness is the dependence on the central column of attack. If the formation is pinned down, it can be broken easily and the enemy may flank it.
