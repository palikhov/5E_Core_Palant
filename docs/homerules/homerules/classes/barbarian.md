## Barbarian
### Path of the Possessed 
In enclosed, sweltering huts across the Known Lands, select 
members of a tribe endure a days long ritual that tests 
the limits of their strength and fortitude. Of the few that 
survive, one is chosen by the shaman to become the vessel 
for a specific spirit of the land. Purified and ritually scarred 
with elaborate swazons favored by the spirit, the chosen 
warrior then either accepts it as their companion and 
mentor or discovers that the spirit can be a pernicious and 
invasive presence, exerting its will like a rider upon their 
mount. 
Shamans perform these rituals due to visions of future 
perils that must be countered or, in the case of some 
Ehtzara, to satisfy a bargain made with the spirit. The 
union thus forged is unbreakable, as the soul of the warrior 
and the spirit become inextricably entwined, with some 
Beltinians warning that the link cannot be broken even 
at death. Even so, many see being chosen as a host for the 
spirit to be a great honor and spend their lives trying to 
satisfy the overpowering urgings of the spirit. For their part, 

the spirit is ruled by a single emotion or desperate purpose 
and will push their flesh mount as hard as possible to satisfy 
their insatiable drive. 
Race Restrictions
The Path of the Possessed is a Primal Casting class, as 
such dwarves, elorii, kio, ss’ressen, val may not choose this 
archetype. 
Fury and Power
Your spiritus imperare has granted you the ability to cast a 
small number of primal spells, but only when you rage. 
Spell Slots
When you choose this path at 3rd level, you gain 1 spell 
slot. You gain another spell slot at 11th level, and at 19th 
level. These spell slots are of a spell level equal to half your 
level in this class, up to a maximum of 5th level. 
You can cast spells when you are raging, but only if 
you use the spell slots and spells granted by your spiritus 
imperare. While raging, you may maintain concentration 
on spells cast with this feature but lose concentration when 
your rage ends. 
You regain all expended spell slots from this feature when 
you finish a short or long rest.
Spells Known
You know the spells granted by your spiritus imperare. 
Spellcasting Ability
Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your spiritus 
imperare’s spells, so you use your Charisma whenever a 
spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use 
your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw 
DC for a spiritus imperare spell you cast and when making 
an attack roll with one.
Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus +  
your Charisma modifier
Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + 
your Charisma modifier
Spellcasting Focus
You are considered your own primal spellcasting focus 
when casting spells from your spiritus imperare’s spell list.
The Jealousy of Spirits
Spiritus imperare are jealous spirits. If you have or take 
levels in any class or sub-class that grants you a spirit 
patron, your spiritus imperare becomes your spirit patron.  
If you have the Pact Magic feature, you can use your spell 
slots from that feature while raging.
Spiritus imperare (Dominant Spirit)
Starting when you choose this path at 3rd level, you attract 
the attention of a savage, nearly feral spirit. Your spiritus imperare grants you spells and spell slots, as well as other 
abilities at 3rd, 6th, 10th and 14th level in this class. Any 
ability gained from you spiritus imperare that calls for a 
saving throw uses your spell save DC.
Your spiritus imperare also exacts a price from you. You 
must abide by the conditions specified in the price of your 
spiritus imperare, or it will withdraw its power. This might 
mean losing access to the abilities it gives you or your spells.
Spirit of Hatred 
Usually taking the form of a wolf, shark or wasp, your 
spiritus imperare is ruled by hate, commonly aimed at a 
race, nationality, or profession. Although you may not share 
the same animosity, the spirit within you sometimes gets 
the best of you, making you say and do things to show its 
displeasure. 
Whispers of Hate (Price): You or your GM must choose 
a race, nationality, or profession. You find it very hard 
to treat a creature from your chosen race, nationality, or 
profession with any level of respect. Unless you and your 
spiritus imperare share the same animosity, you know that 
this hatred is from it. 
You suffer disadvantage on all Charisma checks when 
dealing with the subject of your hate. You may make a DC 
15 Wisdom check to try and suppress your hatred, letting 
you make Charisma checks normally for 1 minute. If you 
fail this check, you must enter a rage and lash out at the 
subject of your hatred.
Spirits of Hatred’s spells
The Spirit of Hatred gives you following spells: 
Spell Level Spells
1st Hellish rebuke 
2nd Dragon’s roar*
3rd Mantle of unassailable flame*
4th Fire shield
Blinded by Hate
Beginning at 3rd level, you may give yourself to the hate 
within. As a bonus action, choose one creature within 30 
feet that you can see to become the focus of your hate for 1 
minute. 
If you attack the focus of your hate using your Reckless 
Attack feature, you may forgo the advantage you gain on 
your attack roll and deal an additional 1d8 damage instead. 
This damage is the same type as your weapon.
While you have a creature selected as the focus of your 
hate, you cannot benefit from Reckless Attack when you 
target any other creature with an attack.
Once you use this feature, you cannot use it again until 
you complete a short or long rest. 

Hateful Gaze
Beginning at 6th level, you gain double your proficiency 
bonus on all Charisma (Intimidate) checks. Also, as an 
action, you may turn your abhorrence-filled gaze on a 
creature you can see within 30 feet. 
The creature must make a Charisma saving throw and 
if they fail, they have disadvantage on the next attack they 
make that targets you. They also have disadvantage on the 
next saving throw they make to resist the effects of a spell 
you cast, if cast within 1 hour. 
If your target succeeds on its saving throw, it is immune 
to your Hateful Gaze for 1 day. Undead, constructs and 
creatures that cannot see are immune to this feature. 
Petrifying Gaze
Beginning at 10th level, any time you hit a creature with 
a melee attack you may, as a reaction, stare own, shaking 
them to their core. They must succeed in a Wisdom saving 
throw or become stunned until the end of your next turn. 
You may use this ability a number of times equal to your 
Charisma modifier (minimum of 1), regaining all expended 
uses at the completion of a long rest.
Consumed by Hate
Starting at 14th level, when you rage you become fully 
consumed by hate and ignore wounds that would fall a 
lesser person. 
While you are raging, you cannot be charmed or 
frightened. In addition, at the start of your turn you gain 5 
temporary hit points.
When your rage ends, you gain 1 level of exhaustion. 
Spirit of Heroism 
These spirits appear as eagles, falcons or lions and urge 
those who bear them to be true Heroes. These furies take 
up a cause and fight for it, regardless of risk and heedless of 
the cost. A fury with this spiritus imperare is consumed and 
obsessed by their righteous cause. 
Righteous Cause (Price): Choose a heroic cause. This 
cause can be things like destroy infernals, protect arcane 
casters from the Harvesters, seek out cults of the Silence 
and destroy them, or defend the people of Coryan from the 
threat of the gar. 
When presented with an opportunity to champion your 
cause you will do everything in your power to complete it. 
If you rage during such an occasion, you cannot willingly 
end your rage as a bonus action unless you make a 
successful DC 15 Wisdom check.


Spirits of Heroism spells
The Spirit of Heroism gifts you with the following spells: 
Spell Level Spells
1st Righteous fury*
2nd Magic weapon
3rd Beacon of hope
4th Freedom of movement
Righteous Blows
Starting when you choose this spirit at 3rd level, you find 
that when you rage you are infused with the unyielding 
righteousness. While raging, your melee attacks deal 
additional radiant damage equal to your Constitution 
modifier.
Righteous Defence
Beginning at 6th level, creatures provoke opportunity 
attacks from you any time a friendly creature within 5 feet 
of you is struck with a melee attack by a creature adjacent to 
you.
Strength of Will 
Beginning at 10th level, while raging you are immune to 
the charmed and frightened conditions. Additionally, if you 
are stunned you may immediately use your reaction to end 
the condition.
Righteous is my Cause 
Starting at 14th level, any time you rage while in pursuit 
of your cause you project a 20-foot radius aura of 
righteousness, infusing your allies with fury. All friendly 
creatures within your aura cannot be frightened and are 
blessed as if under the effects of the spell. Once you use this 
ability you may not call upon it again until you complete a 
short or long rest.
Spirit of Savagery 
Taking the form of badgers or wolverines, spirits of savagery 
revel in bloodshed and wild frenzy. Those who bear these 
spirits love nothing more than to feel the splash of warm 
blood over their faces, and seeing the light dim in their 
victims’ eyes. 
Unbridled Savagery (Price): Your spiritus imperare 
demands blood, a gift you are more than willing to give. 
While you are raging, when you reduce a creature to 0 
hit points, you must kill them. You will not simply knock 
someone out to spare them. 
You may attempt to fight this bloodlust. When you 
reduce a creature to 0 hit points, if you make a successful 
DC 15 Wisdom check you suppress your bloodlust and 
may choose to spare your target. If you do, your spiritus 
imperare is disgusted with you and ends your rage instantly. 
If you fail this check, you must kill your target. 

Spirits of Savagery’s spells
The Spirit of Savagery gifts you with the following known 
spells: 
Spell Level Spells
1st False life

Starting when this spirit is chosen at 3rd level, when you 
engage in two-weapon fighting, you can add your ability 
modifier to the damage of the second attack. Additionally, 
you can draw or stow two one-handed weapons when you 
would normally be able to draw or stow one.
Also, while you are raging and engage in two-weapon 
fighting, if you reduce a creature to 0 hit points you may, as 
a reaction, take the Dash action.
