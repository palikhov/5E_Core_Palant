# Fighter (Arcanis)

## Fighting Style

You adopt a particular style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the following options. You can’t take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again. 

### Archery
You gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls you make with ranged weapons. 
### Canny Defense
While not wearing armor, your AC equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Intelligence modifier. You can use shields and still gain this benefit.
### Defense
While you are wearing armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC. 
### Defensive Duelist
While using a one-handed weapon while leaving your off hand completely free (including not holding a shield), any time you are the target of a melee attack you may use your reaction to gain a +2 bonus to your AC until the beginning of your next turn. 
### Dueling
When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon. 
### Great Weapon Fighting
When you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for an attack you make with a melee weapon that you are wielding with two hands, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll, even if the new roll is a 1 or a 2. The weapon must have the two-handed or versatile property for you to gain this benefit. 
### Knife Fighter
Any time you successfully hit with a dagger or knife you deal +2 damage. Additionally, if you have a hand free you may draw up to two daggers as part of any attack. 
### Protection
When a creature you can see attacks a target other than you that is within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on the attack roll. You must be wielding a shield. 
### Pugilist
Your unarmed strike now deals 1d4 + your Strength modifier in bludgeoning damage. As long as you have a free hand, any time you take the Attack action, you can make an unarmed strike as a bonus action.
### Two-Weapon Fighting
When you engage in two-weapon fighting, you can add your ability modifier to the damage of the second attack. Additionally, you can draw or stow two one-handed weapons when you would normally be able to draw or stow one.

## The Tactician

### Strategic Mind
You have a particularly sharp mind for tactics, possessing the ability to quickly adapt your stratagem to the flow of battle. With this insight, you can guide your allies, allowing
them to position themselves and gain advantage where once there was none.

During combat, whenever a friendly creature that can see or hear you begins their turn within 60 feet of you, you can
gains a Command die, a d6, which they can spend when performing actions in pursuit of your suggested tactic. A suggested tactic must be a specific task such as ‘shove that creature’, ‘cast a spell at that ss’ressen’, ‘withdraw from melee’, or ‘attack that target’, not “kill them all” or “win this battle!”.
Once within the next 10 minutes, your ally can add your Command Die to any attack roll, ability check, damage roll, or saving throw made in pursuit of your suggested tactic.
Your ally can wait until after they roll a d20 before deciding to use the Command die, but must decide before the GM says whether the roll succeeds or fails. Once the
Command die is rolled, it is lost. A creature can have only one Command die at a time. If your ally does not perform the suggested tactic or is somehow unable to do so, the die
is returned to your command die pool after 10 minutes. For example, if you suggest that your ally knock a guard prone, they can only use your Command die on attack rolls or
ability checks to knock down the guard. If for some reason that guard is killed or already knocked prone by the time your ally’s turn comes up, the die is not spent and returned to your pool.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (a minimum of once). You regain any expended uses when you finish a short rest.
Your Command die changes when you reach certain levels in the fighter class. The die becomes a d8 at 5th level, a d10 at 10th level, and a d12 at 15th level.

### Student of History 

Once you reach 3rd level you gain proficiency in the History skill. If you were already proficient with History, you add double your proficiency bonus on all ability checks that benefit from your proficiency in the History skill.

### Tactical Maneuvers
At 3rd level you learn three Tactical Maneuvers, from the list presented below. You learn an additional maneuver when you reach 7th, 10th, and 15th level. Tactical Maneuvers are powered through the use of tactical points. Additionally, anytime you gain a fighter level you may switch one of your Tactical Maneuvers for another.
If any of your Tactical Maneuvers requires a saving throw, that saving throw is equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + Intelligence modifier.

### Tactical Points
You gain 3 tactical points to power your Tactical Maneuvers. You gain an additional tactical point upon reaching 7th, 10th, and 15th level in the fighter class. You regain all spent tactical points after completing a short or long rest.

### Tactical Maneuvers

**Brutal Ambush:** When you and your allies catch an enemy by surprise the results are simply devastating. When you attack a surprised creature, you may spend 1 tactical point as a reaction to grant all friendly creatures within 30 feet who can hear or see you advantage on their next attack roll before the end of their next turn.

**Distracting Strike:** With an attack, you draw a creature’s attention, allowing your allies to disengage safely. When you hit a creature with a melee attack, you may spend 1 tactical point to prevent that creature from taking reactions until the end of your next turn.

**Hammer and Anvil:** You set up a combined attack, trapping your opponent between you and your allies. As an action, you may make a single melee weapon attack and, if you hit, you may spend 2 tactical points to force that creature to make a Wisdom saving throw. If your target fails, they immediately provoke an opportunity attack from any single friendly creature of your choice that is adjacent to the creature you struck.

**Knight’s Move:** You position yourself and an ally into an advantageous position. Immediately after making an opportunity attack, you
may spend 1 tactical point to allow a single friendly creature within 30 feet who can hear and see you to instantly move
15 feet.

**On My Mark:** Sometimes it’s best to lead by example. As part of an attack action, you may spend 1 tactical point to grant a single ally within 30 feet who can hear and see you advantage on their next attack roll against the creature you attack. If your ally successfully hits with this attack they deal an additional 1d6 damage. This damage increases to 1d8 when you reach 5th level, 11th level becomes 1d10 and finally, 1d12 at 17th level.

**Rallying Cry:** You call upon your allies and inspire them to greater acts of heroism. As an action, you may spend 2 tactical points to grant all friendly creatures within 60 feet who can hear or see you a number of temporary hit points equal to 1d10 + your Intelligence modifier. These temporary hit points fade away after 1 minute.

**Stand your Ground:** With a shout, you command your allies to set themselves to receive a charge. When a creature moves within 10 feet of you or an ally within 30 feet of you, as a reaction you can call out to your allies to be ready for an attack. You spend 1 tactical point and all friendly creatures within 30 feet who can hear or see you gain resistance against bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from non-magical weapons until the end of their next turn.

**Strategic Maneuver:** In battle, positioning is everything. As a bonus action, you may spend 1 tactical point to let a
friendly creature within 60 feet who can hear or see you use their reaction to move up to their speed. 

**Strike the Rod:** You can put the fear of a training sergeant into your allies, helping them to shake off lesser fears.
Whenever one of your allies becomes frightened, as a reaction you can help them regain their composure. You spend 1 tactical point and all friendly creatures within 60 feet who can hear or see you can make a new saving throw to shake off any effect which has resulted in the frightened condition. If the effect that granted the frightened condition does not grant a saving throw, your allies must make a DC: 20 Charisma saving throw to remove the frightened condition. 

**Tempting Target:** By making yourself a target for an attack, you force your opponent to overextend, leaving a perfect opening for your allies.
When you take the Attack action, you may spend 1 tactical point as a bonus action to force a creature within your reach to make a Wisdom saving throw. If your target fails its saving throw, all friendly creatures who saw the attack gain advantage on their next attack roll against your target. Regardless of the result of the saving throw, if the target attacks anyone other than you during its next turn it suffers disadvantage on their attack roll

**Warning Shout:** You warn your allies to dive for cover! When a friendly creature within 60 feet who can hear and see you is the target of a spell, you can use your reaction to shout a warning to them. You spend 1 tactical point and that creature gains advantage on their saving throw against the triggering spell. If the spell has no save your ally gains resistance against the triggering spell’s damage instead.

### Cry Havoc

At 10th level, when rolling initiative, you may spend 1 tactical point to grant all allies who can see or hear you within 60 feet advantage on their initiative roll. Once this feature is used it may not be used again until you complete a long rest.

### Crescendo of Violence
Once you reach 15th level any time you score a critical hit you instantly regain a use of Strategic Mind or 1 tactical point (your choice).

### Tactical Awareness
Upon reaching 18th level if you start combat with no uses of Strategic Mind or no tactical points, you instantly recover one of each.
