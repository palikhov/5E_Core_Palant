Literacy: Among the human populace literacy is not a given. In fact, for the majority of the populace “knowing your letters” is a rarity. It is not uncommon for someone to be able to speak many languages and simply be unable to read or write in any of them. As such literacy has become a soft social meter which displays either tutoring or noble blood.
There are four ways to gain literacy; race, background ,giving up a known language, or aquiring the linguist feat.
Both dwarves and elorii have strong traditions of education and gain literacy through their racial heritage. Some backgrounds grant literacy and if you choose a background which oes not grant literacy you may become literate by giving up
one of your known languages.
Gaining literacy makes you literate in all your known languages.
