SPECIAL ALLIES

8 “Who made this thing?? Why did it suddenly show up here? Nono, don’t attack it, I think it’s on our side. Someone give it a com-
mand!”
9 What rules you use for an Antipaladin are up to you, there are many solutions online.

Congratulations! You rolled well on your follower chart 
and attracted a special ally! Allies are like followers in 
that they approve of what you’re doing in the world 
and want to help, but allies are powerful beings, often 

more powerful than your character. They cannot be 
ordered around, and they can be unreliable. Find your 
alignment on the chart below and roll a d12 to see 
which cool beastie shows up to help you out.
