Simple 
Warfare
Some groups want to resolve a big battle, but aren’t 
interested in managing units and just want to know 
“who wins?” For those folks, we present this classic 
solution, which can resolve a battle of any size in a 
few minutes.
Step One: Army Strength
Determine the army strength of each army by adding 
up the costs of their units. Special units with no cost are 
worth 400 points. Units who have suffered casualties 
from previous battles but which are not diminished 
contribute their full value to the total. Diminished units 
contribute nothing. 
Step Two: Force Advantage
Now that we know which army is stronger, we need to 
know: by how much? That means we do a little math. 
Subtract the smaller army’s total from the larger. Then 
divide the difference by the smaller force. This gives us 
a percentage measuring how much stronger the stron-
ger army is. This is the stronger army’s force advan-
tage

## Step Three: Strategic Advantage
We need to know all the strategic advantages each 
army has based on the circumstances of battle. Include 
all that apply from the table on the left:

## ## Step Four: Combat Roll
Each side rolls percentile dice. This is their combat roll.
## Step Five: Advantages
Both sides add their strategic advantage to their combat 
roll. The larger army also adds their force advantage.
Step Six: Victory and Defeat
The army with the larger total is the victor. The differ-
ence is the degree of victory.

## ## Step Seven: Casualty Determination
Now we figure out which of your units will inflict casu-
alties. Use the chart below to determine which of your 
units inflicted casualties, and roll dice for them based 
on each unit’s size. 

## Step Eight: Inflict Casualties
Inflict casualties. Distribute the casualties you suffered 
among your units according to the Order of Battle: 
Levies, then Infantry, then Archers, then Cavalry, 
then Flying.

## Step Nine: Retreats
Determine retreats. If an army loses all their infantry, 
they immediately retreat. If both sides retreat, neither 
side wins objectives.14 Either side can, at this point, 
choose to retreat and quit the field, granting the oppos-
ing side a victory and yielding any objectives. If either 
side retreats, the battle is over. Otherwise, return to 
step one, and fight another battle.

 # Anatomy of unit
## Name and Keywords 
Every unit has an evocative name. The Ironheart  Defenders. The Blood Moon Infantry. The 7th Imperial  Legion. These names are purely flavor.  Our Ironheart Defenders have the following key- words: Dwarf (ancestry), Seasoned (experience),  Medium (equipment), and Infantry (type). Each key- word has an associated chart (See Creating Your Own  Units, page 235) showing you which bonuses you get  from each keyword.
## Ancestry 
You can find a chart listing several likely ancestries  you might need and the unit bonuses they confer on  page 235. Any ancestry you find in the core rules, any  species or monster, could be fielded as a unit, and King- doms & Warfare will list many more. My players once  fought an army composed of jellies and oozes when  they failed to stop the cults in the Temple of Primor- dial Chaos.

## Experience
Experience describes both how much fighting the unit  has seen and how well trained they are. The levels of  experience are:

• Green: Soldiers with any training, but who  have seen no action. Levies who survive a  battle automatically convert into Green Infan- try.  

• Regular: Normal soldiers. A unit of volunteers  who’ve been well trained by seasoned com- manders can begin as Regular, and a typical  large army is mostly composed of Regular units. 

• Seasoned: Troops who’ve seen more than  one battle and lived to tell the tale. Well  versed in warfare, probably been exposed to  stuff that really challenged their morale, like  battle magic. 

• Veteran: Troops who have seen several battles  and know what to expect in warfare. They  are resilient and versed in tactics used to  break morale. 

• Elite: Soldiers who haven’t just seen a lot of  battle and survived, but have trained and  executed complex maneuvers under extraordi- nary conditions. Elite troops require a degree  of flexibility in thinking and improvisation  rarely found in normal soldiers, even veterans.

•Super-elite: The most highly trained and bat- tle-hardened units. These are typically shock  troops, orders of knights on horseback. Small  units capable of surviving for long periods  behind enemy lines.

Experience affects a unit’s Attack (their ability to  successfully execute an offensive maneuver) as well as  their Toughness (their ability to withstand a successful  attack without taking casualties). But mostly a unit’s  experience affects their Morale: their ability to with- stand punishment and endure confusion on the battle- field without becoming afraid or—just as bad—getting  so disorganized that they can no longer fight effectively. 
Equipment How heavily armed and armored is the unit? The  ranks are:

• Light: Leather or no armor. Some troops are  lightly armored because they’re peasants.  Some are lightly armored because it grants  them greater mobility, allowing them to be  deployed quickly into a distant battle.  

• Medium: Hide or a chain shirt. 

• Heavy: Breastplate and shield, or chain mail.  Maybe ring mail—we don’t get really picky  about exactly where each armor combo falls  on this scale. 

• Super-heavy: Full plate mail, heavy weapons,  and the training to use them effectively.

Equipment grants bonuses to the unit’s Power (the  effectiveness of their weapons) and Toughness (their  ability to withstand a successful attack without suffer- ing casualties). 

Type What kind of unit is this? How does it fight? More than  any of the other keywords, type defines the unit and  affects all of its stats. It also defines which units are legal  targets, as described in the Order of Battle (page 239). 

• Levies: Unsoldiers. Levies have no experi- ence level and always have Light equipment.  They are peasants forced to fight by cruel  masters, or willing to fight to defend their land.  They’re basically crap at everything, but they  perform a critical function: they absorb casu- alties, allowing your better-trained units to  keep fighting longer. If they survive, they can  become Green Infantry! Levies usually disband after a couple days’  battles. They do not stick around for weeks  waiting to fight, they have farms to tend. Once  they disband, must convince them to fight all  over again. You cannot pay upkeep to maintain  them as a standing army. 

• Infantry: The meat (possibly literally, depend- ing on whom you’re fighting) and potatoes  of your army. Very limited in whom they  can attack. 

• Archers: Typically archers. Could be javelin- throwers if you’re talking Bronze Age dudes.  Can basically attack anyone. 

• Cavalry: Highly mobile troops deployed to  flank the enemy and hit them where they’re  not defended.  • Airborne: Flying units! That’s right! 

• Fortifications: Keeps, towers, and temples  are all fortifications (see Strongholds as For- tifications on page 9), but so too can a hill  or a wall be one. Any terrain feature one side  can defend or occupy. Typically, defending  a fortification grants the defending units a  Morale bonus.  

• Siege Engines: Typically catapults and trebu- chets, but also monsters like treants, if pressed  into service.



# SIZE

How big, in numbers, is your unit? This is the unit’s  Size, which is represented by a casualty die placed on  its unit card. A unit begins a battle with its casualty die  on its highest face (e.g., “6” for a d6, “8” for a d8). A  unit’s die is decremented—reduced by one—each time  it fails a Morale check and each time an attacker succeeds on a Power check against it. Your army only has one card for a given unit. So  if your army has a lot of Regular Heavy Human Infantry, to pick a random example, you won’t have several  cards all with the same stats. Instead, that unit gets a  larger casualty die. The largest casualty die is a d20,  which represents a very large unit7 that can suffer  many casualties before it breaks or is slaughtered.  

## ATTACK AND DEFENSE 

When your unit attacks an enemy unit, you roll a d208  and add your unit’s Attack. To succeed on the attack,  the result of your roll must equal or exceed the enemy’s  Defense, a measure of both the quality of their gear  and their relevant training. 

## #POWER AND TOUGHNESS 

If your unit succeeds on its attack, it’s time to see  whether your unit is strong enough, and well-trained  enough, to inflict meaningful casualties. Any successful attack will have some consequences,  but when you’re dealing with hundreds of soldiers,  one or two of them dying isn’t significant. Toughness  represents both their literal physical toughness and the  quality of their gear. A successful Power check against  a unit means they will suffer enough casualties to dec- rement the casualty die and, depending on the shape  the unit is in, this may cause a Morale check! 

# MORALE

Morale is a unit’s most important stat, since lots of  things in battle can prompt a Morale check. Unit abili- ties or battle magic that forces a Morale check will list  the DC in the text of the ability or spell. If your unit  is diminished (page 240), just taking casualties can  prompt a Morale check. Failing a Morale check decrements the unit’s casu- alty die. As far as your unit’s effectiveness is concerned,  there’s no difference between losing morale and  losing soldiers.  NO HIT POINTS Your character will be attacked many times over the  course of an encounter. Some attacks miss, some hit. The same is true for the units in your army.

 A hit does not always mean your character dies,  though. Each attack roll begets a damage roll, and it  is only after many successful attack rolls and many  damage rolls that your character finally drops. The same is true for the units in your army. But because A: you are already playing a character  with hit points and doing math every time you take  damage and B: you’re maybe running several units at  once, we do not burden you with doing math over and  over again for your character and all your units. Instead, a successful attack check against a unit  prompts a power check, in which the attacking unit  checks to see “Was the strength of our attack enough to  overcome the enemy’s Toughness?” A common reaction to this system is “Why are there  two attack rolls?” There aren’t! There’s one attack roll  and one damage roll. There’s just no math associated  with the damage roll.

# CREATING YOUR OWN UNITS 

Using the following rules, you can build your own units  with some ancestry options found in most campaigns.  Start by picking a row from each of the following  charts. As you go, write down the total for each stat  (Power, Toughness, etc.) on a blank unit template (page  263). Remember that Levies have no equipment  rating or experience rating. They’re just Levies. Defense and Toughness both start at 10. Step One: Ancestry Choose an ancestry below and add its stat bonuses to  the unit card. Then find the traits of the unit’s ancestry  on the next page and add them to the unit card.

## Step Two: Experience 

Next, choose an experience level and add the bonuses  listed to the unit’s card. 

## Step Three: Equipment 

Now do the same thing with equipment. 

## Step Four: Type 

And then type. Levies and Cavalry both have traits  listed below that can be added to their unit card if you  want to make it easier to remember during battle. Cavalry units gain Charge and can engage. 

### Charge: 

Cannot use while engaged. A Charge is an  attack with advantage on the Attack check. It inflicts  two casualties on a successful Power check. The  charging unit is then Engaged with the defending unit  and must make a DC 13 Morale check to disengage. Levies are always diminished. 

## Step Five: Size Choose a size. This can dramatically affect the unit’s  final cost. 

UNIT SIZE SIZE COST MODIFIER 
1d4 0.66× 1d6 1× 1d8 1.33× 1d10 1.66× 1d12 2×

9 The Defense and Toughness bonuses are added to 10 on the unit card, but for this step we only need the bonuses. 

## Step Six: Calculating Cost 

Now that you’ve filled out the unit card with all its stats,  it’s time to calculate its cost. This can be the literal cost  to buy the unit in gold pieces, in the case of mercenar- ies, or just the cost used to balance encounters and  calculate upkeep. First, add up the bonuses to Attack, Power, Defense,  and Toughness,9 and add double the total bonus  to Morale.  Then, multiply this total by the Cost Modifier from  the unit’s Type, and then multiply it by its Cost Modifier  from Size. Multiply this result by 10.  Add the cost of all the traits of the unit’s Ancestry.  Finally add a flat 30 points. 

## Mercenaries
Mercenaries12 are troops loyal only to the coin you pay  them. They can be bought for gold equal to their unit  cost, but their upkeep is double that of a normal unit  you recruit by rolling on your follower chart. Ancestry and Attitude You can buy units with the same ancestry as your char- acter with no extra cost. However, units from other  cultures have their own attitude toward working for  a puny human, or treacherous elf, or whatever your  character’s ancestry might be, as described on the  chart below.

10 This makes everything scale with the cost of traits and helps differentiate otherwise similar units that would end up with identical costs  but not identical utility. 11  This allows us to have very feeble species like kobolds with negative values without throwing the whole thing off. 12  Great game.


## Attitude Chart

Below is an example Attitude chart, one  designed to reflect the common biases the clas- sic fantasy ancestries have toward each other.  You are encouraged to make your own, reflect- ing your world’s history. Also, you could just  as easily make a chart with nations or cultures  instead of ancestries.
The chart is mirrored across the diagonal, so you can  use it in either direction. Find your character’s ancestry  in either a row or a column, and then index it against  the ancestry of the unit you wish to buy. Allied (A): This unit has its normal cost to buy  and upkeep. Friendly (F): This unit costs 25% more to buy  and upkeep. Neutral (N): This unit costs 50% more to buy  and upkeep. Hostile (H): You cannot buy this unit.
Through good roleplaying and negotiation, though,  you can change the attitude of a particular leader or  army toward your character. Ambassadors An ambassador (page 96) allows you to buy units  from their ancestry as though they were friendly. If  the ambassador’s presence in your court leads to a  formal alliance and a signed treaty, then units with that  ancestry are treated as allied. Unit Upkeep and Improvement Depending on the scenario, the units you command  may naturally disband after the battle, such as Levies,  or return to their homes, like a unit of elves who come  to your aid in a time of dire need. But units you recruit  from your stronghold or buy with cash require upkeep.  A unit must be paid a tenth its cost each season.  Not all this cash goes into the soldier’s pocket—much  of it is paying for food and training and repairing  their gear. A unit that has not been paid for a season suffers dis- advantage on Morale checks. A unit that has not been  paid for two seasons disbands. Improving Unit Equip- ment

## IMPROVING EQUIPMENT
A unit’s equipment (Light, Medium, Heavy, Super- Heavy) can be improved once per season by paying  gold pieces equal to the difference in cost between the  new and old unit.

## IMPROVING EXPERIENCE
A unit’s experience (Regular, Seasoned, etc.) can be  improved by one level after they survive two battles  without breaking morale or retreating. It takes a week  of training at a keep (or at a barracks if you have a cap- tain follower) and costs gold pieces equal to the differ- ence between the new and old unit.

## IMPROVING SIZE
You can field several infantry units, or several cavalry  units for instance, but you can only field one unit with  identical keywords. You may fight a battle with Human  Veteran Light Infantry and Elf Veteran Light Infantry,  but not two units of Human Veteran Light Infantry.  If you roll on a follower chart and get an identical  unit to one you already have, just increase the first  unit’s size by one step. Once per season, you can spend gold to increase  a unit’s size by one step. The cost is the difference in  price between the old unit and the new unit.
13  There’s very little battle magic in this book, mostly in the codices. I didn’t want to overwhelm folks. 

## Narrating the Battle
We’ve done our best to give units abilities with evoca- tive names, but at the end of the day it’s still the GM’s  responsibility to narrate what happens after an attack  fails or a unit disbands. Of course, you can enlist the  players in this cause! They can narrate their units’  actions while you narrate the enemy units’.  A unit that fails an attack might be described as surg- ing forward, smashing into the opposing units, but the  enemy’s shields repulse the attackers. Archer units fire  a volley of arrows into the air and the recipients fail to  deploy shields in time; dozens of soldiers are cut down  by arrow-fire. In the end, however you do it, the raging  battle should evoke resounding clash of arms, routs,  victories and reversals. Now that we understand the basic rules, and we’ve  looked at a sample unit and talked about how it func- tions, let’s fight a war!  BATTLE Setup Place all the unit cards involved in the battle on the  table where everyone can see them.  Feel free to let players with no units control any  extra units the party has recruited. The Encounter While the PCs are fighting the bad guys, their armies  are clashing nearby. Outside the castle walls, or in a  nearby field, or on a hill. Roll initiative and set up your encounter normally,  and run it as you would any other. Issuing an Order On a player’s turn, they may issue one order to a fresh  allied unit. The default order is “Attack!” A unit may  have other possible orders, as described on its card. Each turn, the GM may issue an order to a number  of enemy units equal to the number of players. The  GM may choose to have all enemy units act when the  main villain acts. Or “give”  units to several different  enemy characters to act at different points in the ini- tiative order. Using battle magic13 also counts as issuing  an order. Issuing an order to a unit exhausts it. An exhausted  unit cannot carry out an order again until it is refreshed. All units begin the battle refreshed. Once all units are  exhausted, all units are immediately refreshed.

### Attack 
Choose an attacking unit and a legal defending unit,  as follows.  
Levies: Can be attacked by any units.  
Infantry: Cannot be attacked by infantry while  levies are on the field.  
Archers: Cannot be attacked by infantry or levies  while allied Infantry is still on the field.
Cavalry: Cannot be attacked by infantry or levies.  Archers attack cavalry with disadvantage. Cavalry can  only attack every other round, unless engaged. All Cav- alry have the Charge maneuver (see below). Aerial: Can only be attacked by archers and aerial  units. Can attack any unit. Fortification: Can only be attacked by siege engines. Siege Engine: Can attack infantry, levies, archers,  and fortifications. Cannot be attacked, except by aerial  units, while any allied infantry, archers, or cavalry are  still on the field.
ROLL AN ATTACK CHECK: Roll a d20 and add your unit’s Attack bonus. If the  result equals or exceeds the defending unit’s Defense,  the attack succeeds, which prompts a Power check. Rolling a 20 on an Attack check is a critical hit and the  attacking unit makes two Power tests against the target. Power For your unit to inflict a casualty, you must make a  Power check against the defender’s Toughness. Roll  a d20 and add your unit’s Power bonus. If the result  equals or exceeds the defending unit’s Toughness, you  inflict a casualty! Decrement the defender’s casualty  die by one. If its casualty die already shows “1” and takes a casu- alty, remove the unit from the battle unless it is rallied. Rally Any unit that would be removed from battle can be ral- lied. Their commander makes a DC 15 Morale check.  On a success, the unit remains in the battle with its  casualty die at “1,” but it cannot be rallied again. On a  failure, the unit is removed from battle.

## Diminished 

Once a unit loses half its size—for example, if its d6  casualty die reads “3” or less—it is diminished.  While diminished, it must make a DC 15 Morale  check each time it suffers a casualty. If it fails, it  immediately suffers another casualty. Levies are always considered diminished. 

### Charge

Some units and all Cavalry have a special attack  maneuver called Charge. A Charge is an attack with  advantage on the Attack check. On a successful Power  check, a Charge inflicts two casualties, and the charging  unit becomes engaged with the defending unit.  

### Engage and Disengage

Some attacking units can engage a defending unit.  While engaged, both units may only attack each other.  Unless otherwise specified, the attacking unit can  choose to disengage as an order. The defending unit  cannot disengage. As an order, the attacking unit can  make a DC 13 Morale check to disengage on a subse- quent turn. An engaged unit cannot Charge. 

### Ordering a Retreat

Either side might decide the battle is not going their  way and wish to preserve as much of their army as  possible. You may want to use your army in another  battle, or hope that reinforcements are coming, but  also even in defeat, having a working (though diminished) army under your command improves your posi- tion in negotiations drastically more than not having an  army anymore. Therefore you can, on your turn, order your entire  army to retreat. You can only give this order when all  of your side’s units are frwesh. All of your units imme- diately make a Morale check and are removed from the  battle, ending the battle. The retreating army suffers  any consequences of defeat and the normal penalties  for failing the Morale check made to retreat. However, you army may be unable to retreat because  of their position and circumstance. They might be on a  hill surrounded by an enemy, for instance, or backed  against a sheer cliff, or boxed into a canyon. This is  mostly at the GM’s discretion and is detailed further in  Kingdoms & Warfare.

# VICTORY AND DEFEAT

The GM will determine the victory conditions for a  battle, but here are some typical situations:


• If the enemy leader is defeated, the army  immediately disbands. 

• If the players are defending a fortification  and it falls, their peasant levies disband, their  allies (i.e., units who pledged aid for roleplay- ing or diplomatic purposes) retreat, and any  remaining units must immediately make DC  15 Morale checks. At this point, if the players  don’t call the retreat, they’re basically going to  grind their army into nothing. 

• If either side loses all their infantry, their  remaining units retreat.  

• If the PCs are defeated in battle, their army dis- bands. It can, later, reform depending on the  consequences for losing the encounter.

As with encounters, we hope and expect the players  will win battles, and they usually do. Enemy armies  quit the field because their commander is dead. Enemy  leaders may surrender because their army is about to  be eradicated.  But just as in encounters, we have to deal with the  edge case of players losing. The heroes’ army may be  ground into dust, the heroes may suffer a TPK. These  things should be unlikely, but they’re possible. Defeat If one army is defeated (i.e., all its units have been elim- inated or quit the field), the characters on the winning  side gain a bonus action each round, which can be used  to make an attack or cast a spell with casting time of  “one action.” This represents the morale bonus the winners gain  for defeating the losers and helps lead the encounter  more rapidly to its natural conclusion.
