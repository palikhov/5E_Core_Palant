Harvesting Organs to Create Magic Items

THE ALCHEMY TEST: Once a creature dies, its organs 
begin to decay. You must act within minutes5 of death 
to harvest anything useful. A monster corpse has 
four useful components—described below—and each 
requires an alchemy test to harvest. 
An alchemy test combines two skill checks: first an 
Arcana check to determine if you know where the 
organs are and the best way to harvest the component, 
then a Medicine check to extract and preserve the 
component without destroying it in the process.6 It’s 
like a mini skill challenge.
The DC of the Arcana check to locate the organs 
and remember the best way to extract them equals 8 + 
the challenge rating of the creature you’re operating on.
The DC of the Medicine check to perform the 
surgery and extract enough useful material without 
destroying it depends on the organ in question and 
the challenge rating of the creature, as shown in the 
Alchemy Test table.

RECIPES: Crafting a magic item requires a recipe. A 
sword, +1 isn’t merely a normal weapon with bless cast 
on it during its forging—it requires special metals. For 
potions, unique admixtures must be chemically pre-
pared. Scrolls require rare inks. In some cases, the item 
can only be made under special circumstances, like 
during a specific phase of the moon.
In all these instances, it’s assumed your follower 
knows how to procure just enough of these special 
materials to craft the item in question. How they 
get these materials is a trade secret, but i



The Alchemist

Alchemists are primarily useful for brewing potions, 
but many are also lorecrafty and well versed in obscure 
uses for various materials. Yes, an alarm spell requires 
a bell, but do you know what happens if you use a 
crystal bell crafted by an elf maiden? I don’t, but your 
alchemist might!


THE EYES OF THE BEAST:  
POTION OF INVISIBILITY TO MONSTERS  
(UNCOMMON)
With the preserved eyes of a creature your alchemist 
can make a lesser form of the potion of invisibility. This 
is an uncommon potion requiring a spellcaster of at 
least 3rd level.
The potion takes just as long to craft and costs just 
as much as a potion of invisibility (reduced by the 
alchemist’s crafting bonus), but it only grants invisibil-
ity against exactly the kind of creature the eyes were 
harvested from. A black dragon’s eyes make potions of 
invisibility to black dragons. Not all dragons or even all evil dragons. A potion of invisibility to goblins will not 
work against bugbears or hobgoblins, and a potion of 
invisibility to lizardfolk will not work against troglo-
dytes. Unless, of course, you are a generous GM.

THE BRAIN OF THE BEAST:  
POTION OF MONSTER CONTROL (VERY RARE)
If the rarest and hardest of all organs to harvest and 
preserve—the brain—is brought to an alchemist, they 
can craft the very rare potion of monster control.
This powerful item distills the magics of the spell dom-
inate monster into a potion anyone can drink. Crafting 
this item requires the services of a 7th-level spellcaster. 
Consuming the potion acts just like casting the spell, 
but it only works against the kind of creature whose 
brain was used to make the potion. Also, the target does 
not gain advantage if you are fighting it, and its dura-
tion is 1 hour.

The Blacksmith

THE SMITHY: Your blacksmith can forge magic arms 
and armor. Like with the alchemist, this requires the 
blacksmith to have some knowledge of the nature of 
magic, but they don’t need to be a wizard, thanks to 
the incredibly potent arcane power held within a crea-
ture’s blood.
The smithy allows your blacksmith to craft magic 
arms and armor 10% cheaper and faster than normal 
per level of the smithy.
What items your smith can forge depends on which 
organs you bring!

The Captain

THE CAPTAIN’S SHOP: THE BARRACKS
The first thing your captain does is supervise construc-
tion of a barracks. Your barracks temporarily upgrades 
the experience level of some number of units by one—
Green units become Regular, Regular units become 
Seasoned, etc. 
Your barracks can upgrade a number of units equal 

The Farmer
to its level. It begins at 1st level (one unit affected) 
and can be raised using the Improvement rules to 5th 
level (5 units affected). The units affected are chosen 
at the start of a battle and cannot be changed until the 
next battle.


THE MARKET: Farmers represent a substantive tech-
nological improvement over hunting and gathering. A 
farm with crops and domesticated animals can produce 
many times the food required to sustain the farmer’s 
family. The excess is traded via carters who regularly 
pass through and buy and sell at the local market.
Taxing this commerce provides income for the lord 
of the stronghold. The stronghold produces 100 gp per 
season per farmer on your land.
Farmers also enjoy having a place to drink ale, talk, 
and relax after a hard day’s work before they return 
home to their families. This place is called a tavern, and 
thus is a small town born. 

The Mason
Getting a stronghold built in the first place requires a 
mason, probably several. It’s perfectly natural for one 
to stay around after the thing is done and continue in 
the lord’s service, going from a hired hand to a perma-
nent fixture. 

THE QUARRY: If you attract a mason, there must be a 
quarry somewhere nearby. This is the equivalent of the 
artisan’s shop. The quarry starts at 1st level, and the 
lord can improve it like any other shop.
Having a mason on staff means you pay nothing to 
repair your stronghold after a siege. Your mason will 
make free repairs worth 250 gp per quarry level per 
week. A 3rd-level quarry therefore makes free repairs 
worth 750 gp per week (250 × 3 per week). 
Like carpenters, masons decrease the cost of improv-
ing your stronghold by 10% per quarry level. This cost 
decrease can be combined with the carpenter’s benefit.

The Miner
If you’re lucky enough to place your stronghold near a 
source of metal—which, it turns out, you did if you attract 
a miner—such as a natural cave or a valley dug by an 
ancient river, you can extract metal near the surface.
An experienced miner can survey the terrain in a 
moment and tell what kind of rock you’re on, what 
kind of ore can be found underneath, and how long 
it will take and costly it will be to extract. They bring 
with them their own experienced crew and often their 
families. As many as thirty men and women could be 
working your mine by the end of the first season.

THE MINE: The ore extracted from your mine is valu-
able, and you can sell what you don’t use in improving 
your stronghold and the weapons and armor of your 
units. A mine produces 500 gp per season.
In addition, a mine improves the Equipment of 
some number of your units by one level—a Light 
unit becomes Medium, Medium becomes Heavy, etc. 
This bonus can be applied to one unit per mine level, 
as it includes the time and cost of maintaining their 
improved equipment.


The Sage
Every artisan carries with them a long list of skills and 
traditions that help them craft their wares. But for the 
sage, knowledge isn’t a means to an end—knowledge is 
an end unto itself. 
Each sage is not only an expert in a wide array of 
obscure subjects, but also part of a large network of 
fellow sages, scribes, and librarians, a constant and 
largely secret flow of information going back and forth.
Your sage grants you access to the Sage background 
ability. If your sage doesn’t know the answer to your 
question, they know where the answer can be found.

THE LIBRARY: Give your sage a week to search the 
library and cross-reference the various scrolls, tomes, 
and codices within, and they can give you secret knowl-
edge of the enemies you plan to fight.
Obviously, you’ll need to tell your sage what foes 
you’ll soon go up against. If you know exactly the kind 
of monster you’re about to fight, and your sage has the 
time to do the research, you gain one of the following 
advantages in combat against that type of creature:
• You have advantage on your next attack roll 
against such a creature.
• You negate one resistances of such a creature 
on your next attack roll against one.
• Such a creature has disadvantage on its next 
saving throw against your spells or abilities.
You can use the chosen advantage on a number of 
attacks equal to the level of your sage’s library, after 
which you must take an extended rest (page 15) to 
recharge this ability.
Your sage also knows the location of the nearest 
codex. It may be hidden in a ruin within a few miles of 
your stronghold, or it may be a hundred miles away in 
the library of the king’s archmage. But your sage knows 
its whereabouts.


The Spy
An establishment lets you know what’s going on in the 
local area. What the other nobles, guilds, churches, and 
secret societies are up to. But stare too long into the 
abyss, and you may notice it stares back.


The Tailor
A tailor’s job is literally to make you look good. They 
are experts in fashion and keep up to date on all the 
latest trends, not just in clothing but also style and taste 
and manners. 
Having a tailor in your retinue means you not only 
look good, but you also know how to act, know better 
how to create the reactions you’re looking for in your 
allies and your enemies. Subtle changes to appearance 
and behavior act as a force multiplier for your natu-
ral charisma.
Not every regent yearns for a good tailor. The bar-
barian considers such finery a sign of the corrupt and 
decadent cancer men call civilization. But many rulers 
consider a good tailor a necessity. 

THE TAILOR’S SHOP: With a tailor in your retinue, you 
can, as a reaction, replace the result of any Charis-
ma-based skill check with a 12 (before adding bonuses). 
This can be done a number of times equal to your tai-
lor’s shop level after which you must take an extended 
rest to refresh this ability. 



THE NETWORK: Your spy makes it much harder for 
your enemies and even your allies to know what you’re 
up to. Your spy increases the DC for agents spying on 
you by 3 plus 1 per level of your spy’s network. 
In addition, your spy knows which nearby folk 
might be interested in signing on to your service. Each 
time you roll on your followers chart, the spy lets you 
increase or decrease your roll by up to 3 plus 1 per level 
of your network. By this method you gain some mea-
sure of control over whom you recruit.
