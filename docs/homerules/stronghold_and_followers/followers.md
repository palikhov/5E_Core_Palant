Certainly you don’t have to build a stronghold to attract followers. Follow¬ers can be a reward for any number of famous deeds or accomplishments. If the heroes save the town or rescue the blacksmith, they might well attract some followers!
Backstories
Attracting followers means lots of new characters in your game, and that can be a lot of work for the GM, inventing backstories for everyone. We’ve done our best to shoulder some of that burden by giving exam¬ples of the many followers someone could attract, but we don’t know enough about your setting to describe an orc ambassador, for instance, without making a lot of assumptions that would conflict with many settings.
So that means the GM has to invent and describe the warlocks or stone giants who show up, and for some GMs that’s a lot of fun! It’s neat to have these seeds prompting you to create. “Ooh, a unit of light cavalry shows up! I wonder where they’re from?”
But this can also be a pain the butt depending on what kind of GM you are or even what mood you’re in. So you can always just ask the player who rolled to describe their new follower to you. This can be a lot of fun for them and make them feel more part of the creative process.
Of course, some players won’t like this. For some players, if they invented it, then they know it’s not real and the illusion of reality fails. As you play with folks you’ll learn which players are which.
But it’s perfectly legitimate to crowdsource these followers. Ask the player who rolled to describe their follower. Ask another player to! Make them part of the process and part of the fun. Of course, you’re still the GM, so you’ll still have to approve it.
 
UNITS
A local military company arrives and pledges service to the PC. These soldiers are usually from nearby kingdoms that recently suffered a defeat in battle, or they served a noble who was overthrown, and they’re hoping that pledging service to you will lead to long¬term employment and new victories.
Your character still has to pay the upkeep for these units, but you don’t need to pay the cost to recruit them. Units recruited in this way have the same ancestry as the owner of the stronghold. Attracted Airborne units are typically riding griffons or giant eagles, at the GM’s discretion.
What Can I Do with Units?
I think the number-one use of military units, at least at first, is defending your new stronghold against those who resent this upstart and scheme to take it all from you.
But once that’s over with, you can send your new army off to tame local lands or start conflicts with nearby regents to acquire new territory and resources. Armies are used to project power to take over nearby territories or defend allies. Feel free to be proactive and put your army to work.
RETAINERS
Since your character is an adventurer, it’s not at all sur¬prising that other, less famous adventurers hear the tales of your character’s deeds and show up pledging service. These are called retainers and have their own rules.
Each retainer must be of lower level than your PC. If your PC built or acquired a stronghold at an unusually low level (say, below 7th), just adjust the result of the roll downward.
The Baron of Tor awards Sir Razallax the deed to Greywall Keep. Sir Razallax is a 5th-level paladin and, upon completing renovations and defend¬ing the keep, he rolls a 49 on the Paladin Follow¬ers chart and gets a 7th-level warlord. Because this follower is higher level than Sir Razallax, it is automatically lowered to 3rd level.
Retainers are not PCs. A skinwalker is not a druid, it’s an NPC who was taught a very narrow range of druid abilities. It cannot do most of the things a druid can do. If you find yourself regularly expanding a retainer’s abilities, if you think this skinwalker should be able to heal, since druids can heal, it’s probably better to just use a druid. 
Cool, but Not Too Cool!
Remember, this is a lower-level follower pledging ser¬vice to a regent. They shouldn’t have more or better magic items, but they can be cool. They can be neat or fun to run. Memorable. You don’t want your high-level NPCs to outshine the players and steal their thunder. But a follower who’s cool and memorable validates the player! “Obviously I am pretty awesome,” the player thinks, “if I have a follower like this.”
Followers obey their regent. They want to serve. They do not take the lead. GMs, if you find your player relying overmuch on advice or action from a follower, I recommend you have that follower defer. “Your Grace, you have seen so much more of the world than I. It would be absurd for me to advise you in this matter.”
Lieutenants
I think the first best use for your retainer is to act as your lieutenant who runs the show while you are away from your stronghold. Your lieutenant is a trusted advisor whom you can rely on to do your bidding and carry out your orders. Because they are yours to run, lieutenants let you take Demesne Actions even while you’re off adventuring .
You can also play your lieutenant as a PC should your current one die or if you want to focus on two import¬ant things at once.
Troubleshooters
If you attract more than one retainer, you now have a team who can travel your demesne righting wrongs, enforcing the law, and otherwise solving the lesser problems you are now too high level, and too important, to deal with personally.
Between your PC, your lieutenant, and any trouble¬shooters you attract, you could end up with an entire party to yourself to go on adventures with!
Simpler Than Player Characters
Running a PC is actually quite a lot of work compared to almost any other kind of game we play. They’re incredi¬bly well detailed, with weapon proficiencies and skills and class abilities and six stats with modifiers, maybe spells, and, by the time they’ve got a stronghold, over 50 hit points. Fifty is a lot of anything to track, and we don’t think of it that way because we’re used to it, but it boils down to “You’re going to be doing a lot of addition and/or subtraction between now and going uncon¬scious.”
But it’s our character—we want that level of detail. It reflects how important the character is to us and how complexly we view them.
Do we need that same level of detail for a sidekick? For some people, yes, because with that detail comes flexibility and options, and with that comes power. And many players hate the idea that if only they’d spent more time reading what this second character could do, the second character—and maybe the rest of the party—would still be alive.
This system trades power and flexibility for ease of use. Retainers have many fewer options, but they’re still pretty useful and, most of all, easy to run along with your character. Retainers are like their PC coun¬terparts, but with simpler rules.
There is one type of retainer for each class specialty, but these followers are not PCs and do not have PC stats. They sometimes have access to different skills, saving throws, or abilities.
Hard to Kill
You cannot attract a follower equal to or greater than your level, so by definition your followers are always lower level than your PC. Because of this, followers need to be tougher than a PC of equivalent level, so they can survive combat alongside their higher-lever buddy. To do this, retainers ignore damage (and there¬fore healing) below a certain threshold. In fact, retain¬ers don’t have hit points at all!
Health Levels, Not Hit Points
When the party cleric asks, “Okay, how much damage has everyone taken,” and everybody at the table looks at their character sheet, you know you’re in for a ride.
Because depending on the habits of the players, they may already have to do some math. If a player keeps a running total of their current hit points, then they’ll have to subtract that from their max hit points to give the cleric an answer.
Then on top of this, the cleric inevitably asks, “Well, okay, but what is that compared to your total?” Because obviously “30 damage” can mean very different things to different characters and at different levels. So the cleric wants to know what percentage of your health you have left. But no one ever asks that—that would mean even more math.
In reality, both numbers are important to the cleric! You may have taken a large percentage of damage but a low amount of damage, and that will inform the cleric’s decision on whom to heal.
Having to also do all that same nonsense for your follower is more work than we should need to do just to have a cool buddy. We’re busy people.
So, retainers do not track hit points, but rather health levels. A retainer has health levels equal in number to their Hit Dice or level. Each time a retainer is hit by an attack, they make a Constitution saving throw. The DC is the average damage from the attack .
If they succeed, they take no damage. If they fail, they lose one health level per die of damage from the attack. If they lose their final health level, they drop unconscious and use the normal rules for dying.
Our 5th-level exarch is with her 7th-level PC and the rest of the party. They’re fighting two earth elementals, which is a reasonable battle for five 7th-level PCs.
The elemental hits our exarch with a slam attack.
Its average damage is 14 points, so our exarch makes a Constitution saving throw against DC 14. She succeeds, so nothing happens. Notion¬ally, she’s taken some damage, but not enough to worry anyone. If she had failed, she loses one health level and has 4 remaining.
Pretty simple. One roll, check off a health level box if you fail. Move on.
Healing
Retainers regain a health level after each short rest, and each die of healing used on them recovers one health level. We can imagine that any attack that hits a retainer does some damage, just not enough to matter— likewise, the presence of abilities like lay on hands can recover some damage, just not enough to move the needle. So save that healing for your PC friends.
Initiative
Retainers act when you act. If your retainer has higher Dexterity than you, you gain +1 to your initiative rolls.
Armor Class
A retainer has light, medium, or heavy armor. The specific armor they’re wearing is a detail below this systems’ level of abstraction.
•	Light armor is AC 13.
•	Medium armor is AC 15.
•	Heavy Armor is AC 18.
Abilities
A retainer has a primary ability. They gain +4 to any ability checks with primary abilities, and they gain +2 to all other ability checks.
Skills
A retainer has primary skills. They gain +5 to skill checks with primary skills, and they gain +2 to all other skill checks.
Saving Throws
A retainer gets +3 to all saving throws, and an extra +3 to saves with a primary ability.
They save against spells just like PCs do, but if they succeed on a save, they lose health levels equal to half the original number of dice. So a retainer who saves against a fireball (8d6) loses 4 health levels.
Ancestry, Perception, and Movement
The GM chooses the ancestry (elf, dwarf, human, etc.) of the retainer, which determines their Perception, movement, and special abilities.
Actions
Adventuring followers get all the regular actions PCs do. They can move and act, and they get reactions and bonus actions and attacks of opportunity.
Additionally, all retainers begin with a signature attack they can perform each round. If granted extra attacks, these are always their signature attack. As they gain levels, they unlock special actions (usually spells for spellcasters). Each special action can only be used once per encounter, and each is limited in the number of times per day it can be used.
The DC of a special or signature attack is listed in its description.
At 7th level, retainers can take two signature attacks per round.
Attacking
Making an attack roll for your follower is just going to slow everything down, and if you want to do that, you don’t need these rules—you can just run your follower using PC stats and rules.
If your PC hits an enemy, your follower hits with their signature ability, even if you and your follower are attacking different targets. Your success inspired your follower.
If you miss, or if you simply don’t attack on your turn, then you make an attack roll for your follower . For 
these purposes, a spell that deals damage or prompts an enemy to make a saving throw counts as an attack.
Adventuring followers get +6 to hit with their attacks. This doesn’t change. At the GM’s discretion, you could improve this bonus by 1 at 5th and 7th level.
Spells and DCs
Adventuring followers’ spells and actions that require a saving throw start with DC 13 at 3rd level, improve to DC 14 at 5th level, and finally improve to DC 15 at 7th level. If a retainer makes a spell attack, it uses the same +6 retainers get to all attacks.
Gear
Unless provisions are specifically made otherwise, a retainer has the same gear as a starting PC of their class. For example, a berserker has the same gear you would expect to find on a 3rd-level PC barbarian.
Experience
Your retainers level up once every two times your PC levels up, capping out at 7th level. They gain special actions at 5th and 7th level.
Magic
Adventuring followers can use magic items like anyone else! A +1 longsword increases their attack and damage by 1, and +1 armor increases their AC by 1.
One happy side effect of having followers is you can always pass your obsolete items on to them. Low-level items, once useless as treasure for high-level charac¬ters, now have a use!

Leaders
The character who recruited the retainer is called their leader. This term is referenced in various actions and abilities.

Artisans
It takes many skilled workers4 to build a keep or a tower or a theater. Commonly, one of these skilled laborers, impressed with the lord’s demeanor, will offer to serve the lord permanently, becoming a member of their reti¬nue, living in the stronghold or the surrounding village after the rest of the workers return to their towns.
Each artisan in the lord’s service either grants the lord some benefit or improves the stronghold in some way.
Where Do Artisan Followers Come From? Newly minted regents inspire people, but they also present an opportunity for other people to fulfill here¬tofore thwarted ambition.
The mason who sets up shop in a fighter’s keep was probably one of the folks who helped build it. It takes several masons to build or restore a keep. One of them naturally assumed a leadership position over the others, was trusted by the nascent lord, and stayed on when the project was done. The mason probably has family in a nearby town. Some of them might move to the village that slowly accumulates around the lord’s keep.
A tailor who joins a lord in their wilderness strong-hold may be a local townsperson seeking greater glory, the opportunity to serve a baron or a count! Or they may be someone from the nearest big city who’s tired of serving folks who don’t appreciate their handiwork, hearing tell of a newly landed noble building a keep, and decides it is better to be a big fish in a small pond than a little fish in the great wide ocean. The tailor from the big city brings with them all the prejudices of civilization, but also all the knowledge that comes with it, knowledge of court intrigues and fashion.

Most artisans come with their own shop, which they set up for free and which starts at 1st level. You can pay to improve it based on the Artisan Shop Improvement Table. This process takes four months (one season), and you cannot pay more to speed this up. The maximum shop level is 5.
Harvesting Organs to Create Magic Items
If you’ve got a blacksmith, a scribe, or an alche¬mist waiting back at your stronghold, suddenly the corpses of the creatures you defeat in combat become bags of useful organs! Not just a smelly reminder of your triumph.
With some corpses of magical creatures, normal people with no levels in a spellcasting class can craft magic items, because the files are in the computer...er, the magic is in the creature, in its organs. A dragon obviously can’t fly under its own caloric power, that’s ridiculous. It is a magical creature, and by the careful harvesting of its organs, you can distill some of that magic for your own use. In all cases, use the normal rules and requirements for crafting magic items. The artisan follower simply reduces the time and cost.
In each case, a spellcaster is needed to imbue the item with the requisite magical power. The caster isn’t using a specific spell, merely the arcane talent and magical knowledge necessary to manifest the item’s ability.
THE ALCHEMY TEST: Once a creature dies, its organs begin to decay. You must act within minutes5 of death to harvest anything useful. A monster corpse has four useful components—described below—and each requires an alchemy test to harvest.
An alchemy test combines two skill checks: first an Arcana check to determine if you know where the organs are and the best way to harvest the component, then a Medicine check to extract and preserve the component without destroying it in the process.6 It’s like a mini skill challenge.
The DC of the Arcana check to locate the organs and remember the best way to extract them equals 8 + the challenge rating of the creature you’re operating on.
The DC of the Medicine check to perform the surgery and extract enough useful material without destroying it depends on the organ in question and the challenge rating of the creature, as shown in the Alchemy Test table. 
A given corpse can only withstand one alchemy test before it’s unusable.
RECIPES: Crafting a magic item requires a recipe. A sword, +1 isn’t merely a normal weapon with bless cast on it during its forging—it requires special metals. For potions, unique admixtures must be chemically pre¬pared. Scrolls require rare inks. In some cases, the item can only be made under special circumstances, like during a specific phase of the moon.
In all these instances, it’s assumed your follower knows how to procure just enough of these special materials to craft the item in question. How they get these materials is a trade secret, but it typically involves relying on a network of fellow craftsmen they established before joining your employ.
Generally we don’t worry too much about which rec¬ipes an artisan follower has access to. Their job is to save you time and money—all the other requirements must be met normally—but the GM could rule that the artisan comes with a handful of recipes and make find¬ing other recipes part of adventuring!
Goran the Smith offers his services to Lady Hal- frid. When she asks what services he can pro¬vide, he mentions repairing armor and forging weapons, and he discreetly mentions that if she knows a mage, he has the knowing of crafting javelins of lightning passed down from his grand¬father’s father. A very useful inheritance!
 
The Alchemist
The alchemist is to the wizard as the blacksmith is to the fighter. Closely related disciplines that nonetheless require so much specialized knowledge it’s function¬ally impossible to be a master at both.
Alchemists are primarily useful for brewing potions, but many are also lorecrafty and well versed in obscure uses for various materials. Yes, an alarm spell requires a bell, but do you know what happens if you use a crystal bell crafted by an elf maiden? I don’t, but your alchemist might!
Many wizards began life as alchemists in service to a lord. Eventually frustrated by the limits of what alchemy can do, they set out to learn proper magic!
THE LABORATORY: The laboratory allows your alche¬mist to craft potions 10% cheaper and faster than normal per level of the laboratory. The alchemist is not a wizard or sorcerer but understands the principles of magic well enough to duplicate their effects while making potions.
The kinds of potions your alchemist can make depend on the monster organs you bring them!
THE EYES OF THE BEAST:
POTION OF INVISIBILITY TO MONSTERS (UNCOMMON)
With the preserved eyes of a creature your alchemist can make a lesser form of the potion of invisibility. This is an uncommon potion requiring a spellcaster of at least 3rd level.
The potion takes just as long to craft and costs just as much as a potion of invisibility (reduced by the alchemist’s crafting bonus), but it only grants invisibil¬ity against exactly the kind of creature the eyes were harvested from. A black dragon’s eyes make potions of invisibility to black dragons. Not all dragons or even all

POTION OF INVISIBILITY TO MONSTERS (UNCOMMON)
With the preserved eyes of a creature your alchemist can make a lesser form of the potion of invisibility. This is an uncommon potion requiring a spellcaster of at least 3rd level.
The potion takes just as long to craft and costs just as much as a potion of invisibility (reduced by the alchemist’s crafting bonus), but it only grants invisibil¬ity against exactly the kind of creature the eyes were harvested from. A black dragon’s eyes make potions of invisibility to black dragons. Not all dragons or even all
evil dragons. A potion of invisibility to goblins will not work against bugbears or hobgoblins, and a potion of invisibility to lizardfolk will not work against troglo¬dytes. Unless, of course, you are a generous GM.
THE BRAIN OF THE BEAST:
POTION OF MONSTER CONTROL (VERY RARE)
If the rarest and hardest of all organs to harvest and preserve—the brain—is brought to an alchemist, they can craft the very rare potion of monster control.
This powerful item distills the magics of the spell dom¬inate monster into a potion anyone can drink. Crafting this item requires the services of a 7th-level spellcaster.
Consuming the potion acts just like casting the spell, but it only works against the kind of creature whose brain was used to make the potion. Also, the target does not gain advantage if you are fighting it, and its dura¬tion is 1 hour.

The Blacksmith
A skilled blacksmith is one of the most valued and useful members of any town. Metal is difficult to extract from the ground, almost as difficult to process, and the ability to repair metal or beat it into a new and useful shape is akin to sorcery. Indeed, the blacksmith’s trade secrets are as closely guarded as any wizard’s tome.
A blacksmith is a great help when building your stronghold, but mostly for nails! Many stone fortifica¬tions benefit from wooden frames to hoist stones or build scaffolding, and these things need lots of nails. The amount of time a smith actually spends on weap¬ons and armor in a normal village can be close to zero. Of course, a PC’s blacksmith is a different story...
 
THE SMITHY: Your blacksmith can forge magic arms and armor. Like with the alchemist, this requires the blacksmith to have some knowledge of the nature of magic, but they don’t need to be a wizard, thanks to the incredibly potent arcane power held within a crea¬ture’s blood.
The smithy allows your blacksmith to craft magic arms and armor 10% cheaper and faster than normal per level of the smithy.
What items your smith can forge depends on which organs you bring!
THE BLOOD OF THE BEAST: ARROWS OF SLAYING
The alchemy test needed to make arrows of slaying depends on the CR of the monster in question, as described in The Alchemy Test (page 83). The number of arrows you get is also based on the CR of the monster. Very powerful monsters yield only a single arrow. Crafting the arrows requires the services of a 9th-level spellcaster.
If a player asks, “Why there aren’t more of these things out in the world?” remind them that there are few people out there with the necessary skill (alchemy), opportunity (adventuring), and resources (stronghold with appropriate follower), and even then, you only get a handful of arrows, and of course they are spent once shot!
You might make the arrows of slaying look markedly different from normal arrows. When one of my play¬ers found an arrow of orc-slaying, I described it as “the White Arrow,” and it was made of bone. The player had no idea what it was, but they were fighting lots of orcs!
When they finally faced off against Bonebreaker Dorokor and said, “I fire the White Arrow!” it was a dramatic moment indeed, as the players gasped and waited to see what it might do. And the White Arrow did not disappoint!

THE SWORD WITH BLOOD IN THE BLADE:
SLAYING WEAPONS
At the lord’s request, the smith can use vials of monster blood to enhance the bonus of a newly forged magi¬cal weapon.
While crafting a magical weapon with the slashing property, if the blacksmith quenches the blade of the weapon in the blood of a monster, this produces a slaying blade with an extra bonus to damage based on the kind of monster. Crafting the weapon requires the services of a 3rd-level spellcaster.
The alchemy test needed to make a slaying weapon depends on the CR of the monster in question, as described in The Alchemy Test (page 83). Using the blood of multiple monster types dilutes the for¬mula, giving no bonus against any monster type to the weapon.
Lady Sariel brings her smith, Dyfan, a bladder full of lizardfolk blood. Because Lady Sariel is a cleric, and therefore a spellcaster, she can assist Dyfan in crafting a sword of reptile slaying that, when complete, is a +1 sword that does an extra 3d6 damage versus lizardfolk and snake men.
EXAMPLE BLACKSMITH: URR THE ONE-HANDED
Technically he’s one-armed, but calling him the "one-elbowed,” while accurate, would be much less dramatic. Urr is a half-orc smith who learned the trade from his mother’s father. The lack of an arm doesn’t seem to inhibit his skill. His smithy is littered with frames and devices he’s cobbled together to hold items in place and act as his left arm. But typically he’s found in his smithy aided by young apprentices. For some reason the boys and girls of the local village love Urr. He treats them like adults and makes small toys for them, and though he barks and scowls they know he feels affection, not malice, toward them.
"I went to visit my father’s people once, as a boy. They took my arm as payment for time spent among the men of fields and farms. So if you’re plannin’ on using it against the ores of the hills, then aye. I’ll make the weapon for you. Beat the dents out of that armor, too. Do whatever you ask because you give me a place to work, and you don't look at me different to anyone else. That earns you my labor. ”
The Captain
The experienced soldier tired of campaigning abroad, the watch commander sick of fighting endless crime in the big city. Any captain used to command might retire their post when they hear tell of a new lord or lady with a keep or tower to defend.
Like other artisans, captains sometimes come from local villages the heroes saved. More than other arti¬sans, the captain knows how hard an adventurer’s job is. Respects them. If you saved the village from the conspiracy of lizardmen in the swamp, the local watch captain may well decide it would be better to serve you, than continue taking abuse from the town council, none of whom have ever lifted a sword. Captains like serving characters who act, rather than deliberate.
A captain can also serve ably as your lieutenant if you haven’t yet rolled a retainer. Your captain will serve your domain while you adventure, protecting your interests and negotiating on your behalf to the best of their ability.
Like all followers, the captain is loyal, but unlike the others, there’s iron in the glove. With the power and authority to wage war, you may return to find your keep under siege. Its only defense: the strategy and tactics of your captain.
A captain does not automatically come with an army! It’s entirely possible to recruit a captain in spite of having no troops, no army for them to lead. This is of little concern to the captain, they’re certain you will need an army eventually, especially now that you’ve raised this lovely stronghold. Captains make excellent lieutenants, running your demesne while you are adventuring abroad.
THE CAPTAIN'S SHOP: THE BARRACKS
The first thing your captain does is supervise construc¬tion of a barracks. Your barracks temporarily upgrades the experience level of some number of units by one— Green units become Regular, Regular units become Seasoned, etc.
Your barracks can upgrade a number of units equal to its level. It begins at 1st level (one unit affected) and can be raised using the Improvement rules to 5th level (5 units affected). The units affected are chosen at the start of a battle and cannot be changed until the next battle.

EXAMPLE CAPTAIN: CAPTAIN HORBLACK
Captain Edmund Horblack served another local lord until he died, leaving no issue, and nearby barons sacked his keep and divided his land.
Now Captain Horblack, veteran of several cam¬paigns, sees the opportunity to throw in with a younger lord who’s less likely to fall prey to the machinations of the local nobility.
In his mid-thirties with a short crop of jet-black hair, Horblack is a fit and energetic captain who believes in shouting loudly and drilling con¬stantly. The soldiers love him. "This is proper soldiering,” they think.
"I’ll whip ’em into shape sire, you leave it to me. Ahh, I’ve seen worse in Lord Armigen’s command and he won three battles, and all in the same day! You got yourself four able companies here, mi'lord. We’ll get the herald to make 'em a device. Something to wear, show off the colors. Does wonder for a soldier's spirit, knowin’ 'e belongs to a company in the service of a proper lord. Not a mercenary band fightin’ for pay.
‘I’ll run the lot of ’em while you’re gone. Leave everything to me, sire. You won't recognize 'em when you get back! They’ll be on parade smart and know their drilling and their marching. You’ll see, sire. And if anyone should come pokin’ around while you’re gone, thinking the master's away it's time to play, they’ll get four companies of pike in their face and the scars to remember us by!"

The Carpenter
You can build a stone keep or castle without the aid of wood scaffolding, but you wouldn’t want to. A wood- wright’s frames, blocks and tackle, scaffolding, all help your laborers, making ten men work like fifty.
And of course, many of the structures in and around a stronghold are made of or use wood in their walls and frames. A thirty-foot-tall hollow cylinder of stone is a granary. Put some joists, frames, two floors, and some stairs in, and now you’ve got a tower that folk can live in!
THE CARPENTER'S SHOP: Carpenters lower the cost to build and upkeep siege engines by 10% per level of their shop, and they let you improve your stronghold 10% faster per level of the shop.

EXAMPLE CARPENTER:
ARRANEL THE WOODWRIGHT
Arranel is a young lady of barbarian descent with long black hair. She arrives at your stronghold with her brother and sister, Caden and Talwyn both much younger than her. Caden and Talwyn are too shy to talk to strangers but love working for their older sister and can always be found beavering around her woodshop.
Like the mason or blacksmith, Arranel is a woman of few words. Only comfortable talking about her work, she prefers to let her craftsman¬ship speak for her.
‘It'll take a lot of wood, but we’re surrounded by forest. This place’ll be clear for three miles in every direction by the time we're done. Good though. Make it hard for anyone to sneak up on this place. We’ll start with the watchtower. Don’t want to get interrupted by Sir Pelliton bringing his Illriggers up here without us knowing it. I’ll need a whole team. Hope you brought more than a few coppers out of that ruin."

As carpenters harvest the trees around your strong-hold, exposing fertile earth, farmers come to work the land. They bring with them trade, roads, order. With-out farms and farmers, your stronghold is just a myste¬rious tower in the middle of the forest, little known and avoided by locals. With farmers, it’s the beginning of a town. Part of the great network of civilization.
The buildings, shops, and homes we associate with a village begin as a market, temporarily erected by the local farmers at the crossroads by the stronghold. From here they sell their excess production, the taxes of which benefit the lord, which benefits everyone.
THE MARKET: Farmers represent a substantive tech-nological improvement over hunting and gathering. A farm with crops and domesticated animals can produce many times the food required to sustain the farmer’s family. The excess is traded via carters who regularly pass through and buy and sell at the local market.
Taxing this commerce provides income for the lord of the stronghold. The stronghold produces 100 gp per season per farmer on your land.
Farmers also enjoy having a place to drink ale, talk, and relax after a hard day’s work before they return home to their families. This place is called a tavern, and thus is a small town born.
 
EXAMPLE FARMER:
WILLEM THE BALD
Willem is the aged patriarch of a large family. His wife, five children, and eight grandchildren help him work a large farm with many modest herds of animals (chickens, cows) and several fields of crops. Willem’s farm is so large he acts, maybe rightly, as a minor lord of his own. Though in his late seventies, he still wakes with the dawn and works ’til sundown.
"Wolves and the lot, we can handle 'em. We had goblins year before last. The boys took care of them. But these bandits. They’re smart. Well supplied. Got mages and priests I hear tell. My lord, I think this is the tip of a spear. They’re not testing me and mine. They’re testing you. Seein' how you’ll react. You want my advice? You hit 'em back. Hard. Teach 'em who rules here." 


The Mason
Getting a stronghold built in the first place requires a mason, probably several. It’s perfectly natural for one to stay around after the thing is done and continue in the lord’s service, going from a hired hand to a perma-nent fixture.
THE QUARRY: If you attract a mason, there must be a quarry somewhere nearby. This is the equivalent of the artisan’s shop. The quarry starts at 1st level, and the lord can improve it like any other shop.
Having a mason on staff means you pay nothing to repair your stronghold after a siege. Your mason will make free repairs worth 250 gp per quarry level per week. A 3rd-level quarry therefore makes free repairs worth 750 gp per week (250 x 3 per week).
Like carpenters, masons decrease the cost of improv¬ing your stronghold by 10% per quarry level. This cost decrease can be combined with the carpenter’s benefit.
Lord Kenway’s stronghold has both a 5th-level mason’s quarry and a 5th-level carpenter’s shop, so he can improve Castle Dalrath 50% faster and 50% cheaper.
 
EXAMPLE MASON: GALDER OF CHALK
Galder is an old man, blind in one eye, from the nearby town of Chalk. Naturally takes charge of any group of workers. He’s easy to get along with, laughs a lot—though typically at other masons’ poor workmanship. Galder works hard during the day and expects a pint of ale at the end of it. He likes dwarves and thinks better of a stronghold if there’s at least one dwarf around the place. He thinks their presence makes the stones healthier.
"Well now you see this wall here? All fieldstones. Limestone, some sandstone. Travertine. Looks like they started with granite and gave up!" he wheezes, laughing. "Can do some work. Clean the place up. Fixing that tower though, gonna need a proper quarry. Means sending off to Malle near the high city. Take some time, need some workers. Won’t be secret. Everyone will know we’re fixing this place up. Hope you’re prepared for the attention!" 

The Miner
If you’re lucky enough to place your stronghold near a source of metal—which, it turns out, you did if you attract a miner—such as a natural cave or a valley dug by an ancient river, you can extract metal near the surface.
An experienced miner can survey the terrain in a moment and tell what kind of rock you’re on, what kind of ore can be found underneath, and how long it will take and costly it will be to extract. They bring with them their own experienced crew and often their families. As many as thirty men and women could be working your mine by the end of the first season.
THE MINE: The ore extracted from your mine is valu¬able, and you can sell what you don’t use in improving your stronghold and the weapons and armor of your units. A mine produces 500 gp per season.
In addition, a mine improves the Equipment of some number of your units by one level—a Light unit becomes Medium, Medium becomes Heavy, etc. This bonus can be applied to one unit per mine level, as it includes the time and cost of maintaining their improved equipment.


    EXAMPLE MINER: ZORAN STEELEYE
The dwarf Zoran Steeleye is famous among his people for his ability to look at a distant hillock, or the way rainwater cuts through a valley, and tell what precious ores—if any—might be found beneath the earth.
"Aye, we’ll handle the spalling and the vanning. You’ve got a nice source of running water here, so if the miller don’t put in a waterwheel, we’ll set up for a sluice. No, we don't need no guard. We know what kinds of things be found in the pits of the world. Me brother and his family are in on this job, and he and his boys fought gob¬lins, kobolds, all manner of beastie. We’ll let you know if there’s anything down there we can't handle. Broke through to a tomb, once! That was something to remember.
'You should know, sire: seam like this...it's valuable. Folk will hear tell of it. Every time we strike ore like this, and I mean every time, someone comes to take it. So you best be ready to defend it. You got you a keep, a retinoo. Time you muster some troops. Levies won’t do it, sire. Gotta be proper soldiers, or say goodbye to all this precious ore." 

 
The Sage
Every artisan carries with them a long list of skills and traditions that help them craft their wares. But for the sage, knowledge isn’t a means to an end—knowledge is an end unto itself.
Each sage is not only an expert in a wide array of obscure subjects, but also part of a large network of fellow sages, scribes, and librarians, a constant and largely secret flow of information going back and forth.
Your sage grants you access to the Sage background ability. If your sage doesn’t know the answer to your question, they know where the answer can be found.
THE LIBRARY: Give your sage a week to search the library and cross-reference the various scrolls, tomes, and codices within, and they can give you secret knowl-edge of the enemies you plan to fight.
Obviously, you’ll need to tell your sage what foes you’ll soon go up against. If you know exactly the kind of monster you’re about to fight, and your sage has the time to do the research, you gain one of the following advantages in combat against that type of creature:
•	You have advantage on your next attack roll against such a creature.
•	You negate one resistances of such a creature on your next attack roll against one.
•	Such a creature has disadvantage on its next saving throw against your spells or abilities.
You can use the chosen advantage on a number of attacks equal to the level of your sage’s library, after which you must take an extended rest (page 15) to recharge this ability.
Your sage also knows the location of the nearest codex. It may be hidden in a ruin within a few miles of your stronghold, or it may be a hundred miles away in the library of the king’s archmage. But your sage knows its whereabouts.
 
EXAMPLE SAGE:
BERYAN TREWARTHEN
Unknown to anyone save her family, the elf maiden Beryan Trewarthen has run away from the Orchid Court of her uncle and aunt and now controversially offers her services to a local lord. Obviously she senses some impending danger which the elven court—typically—ignores. She has left the timeless world of her elf kin to join you and aid you in your quests.
Tall and willowy with long blonde hair, she is easily mistaken for a human woman, and indeed many of the folk in your service take her to be a human like them, seeing her as they do rarely and then only through the window of the tower you built for her and her library.
“The knowledge you seek exists and moreover I know where it can be found. It is the Codex Incab- ulum, the Tome of Binding Demons. Whosoever holds the Incabulum is said to be warded against all demonic violence. It was written by Marcus Gaius Orestes in the 101stst year of the Age of Conquest. It has disappeared and resurfaced sev-eral times in the past thousand years, but to my certain knowledge it now resides with the arch vizier of the pharaoh in the Infinite Desert. I also happen to know the desert is not infinite, but that knowledge is less obscure."


The Scribe
Fingers stained black with ink, the scribe is not an author but a craftsman. Part tanner, part alchemist, the scribe spends their time curing hide for vellum and mixing rare chemicals for inks.
In a pretechnological world, the ability to read and write is neither common nor particularly valued. Her¬alds post and read proclamations, a constable or reeve might be able to read enough words in the typical legal document to make it out, but otherwise the act of letter-writing is reserved for priests and wizards and educated city-folk.
Scribes therefore also act as aides for diplomatic communications. When the lord wants to send a mes¬sage to their allies, the scribe is summoned.
Scribes are expected to be conversant in many written languages and capable of translating at least between Common, Elvish, and Dwarvish, sometimes Draconic, and sometimes rare and obscure or dead languages found in the kinds of tomes recovered from ruins and dungeons.
But of course the most valued use of a scribe for the adventuring lord is the crafting of scrolls!
THE TANNERY: Magical scrolls require rare and unique chemicals to make inks as well as special tanning tech-niques to cure the vellum in a tannery. All parchment is made from cured animal hide, but vellum is espe¬cially durable, resistant to both flame and water, and well suited to holding the unique inks used in a magical scroll without running or fading over time. A scribe would never consider inking onto paper. A paper scroll wouldn’t survive long in the conditions the typical adventuring lord is used to.
If a spellcaster of appropriate level is present for at least an hour, a scribe can craft a magic scroll in a frac¬tion of the time it would take a wizard or sorcerer to do it alone. The time and cost are both reduced by 10% per level of the tannery.
THE HEART OF THE BEAST: SCROLLS OF PROTECTION AGAINST MONSTERS (UNCOMMON)
If you present your scribe with the heart of a monster, they will be delighted. The opportunity to craft a scroll of protection against monsters is a rare privilege—it’s a chance to pay you back with something that might save your life.
Similar in all other ways to the rare scroll of protec¬tion, the scroll of monster protection only works against the exact species of monster the heart was harvested from. The heart of a black dragon (the recovery of which takes hours) allows for the crafting of a scroll of protection from black dragons. Not all dragons or even all evil dragons!
 
Because the scroll is uncommon, it can be crafted faster and cheaper than its more useful and rarer sibling. Scribing the scroll requires the services of a lst-level spellcaster.
EXAMPLE SCRIBE:
DEMELZA THE BLACK-FINGERED
Well, she has black fingertips, what do you expect? And the sobriquet helps distinguish her from Demelza the Miller’s Wife.

Demelza is hardy and stout, a condition she attributes to hours spent in her shop bent over her inks. Her husband is Callum the Baker, and while they are a notoriously happy couple, nei¬ther is allowed in the other’s shop for fear of one’s coated fingers contaminating the other’s chemical processes.
"Black gods, where did you come by this lovely? Oh come to mother, darling! Wait don't tell me, let me guess...it's the heart of a...mmm...big, looks like a flying beastie, and you’re not a one to kill a griffon or a pegasus. A manticore! Hahah, you killed one'a them flying lion scorpion mon¬strosities that plague the hills! Well leave it to old Demelza, dearie. I mean, your ladyship. You’ll not be bothered next time you come across one of these buggers, I’ll tell you that for nothing. I’ll boil this one up right away. Have to dust off the cauldron..." 

The Spy
An establishment lets you know what’s going on in the local area. What the other nobles, guilds, churches, and secret societies are up to. But stare too long into the abyss, and you may notice it stares back.
THE NETWORK: Your spy makes it much harder for your enemies and even your allies to know what you’re up to. Your spy increases the DC for agents spying on you by 3 plus 1 per level of your spy’s network.
In addition, your spy knows which nearby folk might be interested in signing on to your service. Each time you roll on your followers chart, the spy lets you increase or decrease your roll by up to 3 plus 1 per level of your network. By this method you gain some mea¬sure of control over whom you recruit.

EXAMPLE SPY: PICK
Pick is a tall, thin man with burns all down the left side of his face. He habitually spins a plectrum— the pick from which he gets his name—adroitly between his fingers, though he has never been seen with an instrument.
He is cold, efficient, and utterly committed to the destruction of those who would plot against you.
They know you came up from Ringwell with some¬thing. They don't know what and they know you don't know either. They won't try to take it from you—between you and your friends, they know how that gambit would end. So.they're going to make a play for Maiden Trewarthen. They will rightly conclude that if they can neutralize her, your ability to identify the artifact in question will be greatly hampered if not completely eliminated.
'What do you mean, ‘What am I going to do?' I'm going to make sure they get what they want. Their assassins will come expecting to find a tall, blonde elf woman in your library. And they will find one, and they will kill her. They’ll report back that she’s dead, and that will buy us...oh, l should think at least a season's work uninterrupted By which time the real hlaiolen Trewarthen will have unlocked the secrets of the artifact in question, and by the time they realize they assassinated a double, it will be too late. This, by the way will also secure hlaiolen Trewarthen's safety as, once the secrets are unlocked she will no longer present a threat. They won't try for her again.
'Don't give me that look. This is why you pay me. bo you can sleep at night."

The Tailor
A tailor’s job is literally to make you look good. They are experts in fashion and keep up to date on all the latest trends, not just in clothing but also style and taste and manners.
Having a tailor in your retinue means you not only look good, but you also know how to act, know better how to create the reactions you’re looking for in your allies and your enemies. Subtle changes to appearance and behavior act as a force multiplier for your natu¬ral charisma.
Not every regent yearns for a good tailor. The bar-barian considers such finery a sign of the corrupt and decadent cancer men call civilization. But many rulers consider a good tailor a necessity.
THE TAILOR'S SHOP: With a tailor in your retinue, you can, as a reaction, replace the result of any Charis¬ma-based skill check with a 12 (before adding bonuses). This can be done a number of times equal to your tai¬lor’s shop level after which you must take an extended rest to refresh this ability.
EXAMPLE TAILOR:
MISTER MARKENSWORTH
Mister Markensworth is of average height but gaunt, his skin showing a greyish pallor. He cups his right elbow in his left hand while he speaks, and he often places a finger to his lips as though silencing himself lest he be openly critical of your fashion choices. He is of indeterminate age, could be anywhere from 44 to 74, and for as long as he’s been in your service, you’ve never seen the man eat.
"Mi'lady of course you want to be intimidating and yes we agree that a lightning bolt usually has the last word in such matters, but spells are precious! Or so we’ve been told. Much less expensive is the right word in the right place, with the right demeanor. Now, for instance, that dress you’re wearing. Little better than sackcloth. Yes I know you recovered it from an elven temple, but did you consider it was lying there, disused, for a reason? If you’ll only allow us, we’ll make you a new outfit with wider shoulders, perhaps some discreet padding here and here, and a cinched waist to reinforce mi’lady’s already quite imposing figure. With this dress, mi’lady, your merest whisper becomes an order. They will be compelled. ’’

AMBASSADORS
The rulers of some nearby culture know about you and your new stronghold and demesne, and they want an alliance. That, of course, may take some time and nego-tiation, so in the meantime they’ve sent an ambassador!
Ambassadors allow you to purchase units from their ancestry as though they were friendly (see Ancestry and Attitude on page 238).
If you are ever awarded units you didn’t buy, by roll-ing on a follower chart or adding a keep to your castle for instance, then the new units can be from the ambas¬sador’s ancestry if you wish.
An ambassador is a representative not only of another species, but another government. An orc ambassador isn’t a representative for all orc-kind—they represent a specific tribe of orcs. Their goal is to eventually sign an accord, either officially or unofficially, but for now they’re happy just having a representative in your court who can advise you and ideally pave the way for a more lasting alliance.
These are rewards. Not enemy spies. They are dip-lomatic opportunities for the player, part of the reward for building a stronghold. Players may be suspicious of 
this stranger who arrives promising military aid cheap, but you should encourage them, even tell them explic¬itly if necessary, “This ambassador will work with you.”
Of course, this could present some amazing nar¬rative and roleplaying opportunities down the line if events unfold that drive a wedge between the PC and their ambassador, but as long as this is a natural devel¬opment of events, and the player understands this, it should be fine.
ALLIES
You might end up rolling on the Special Allies chart (page 67) based on your alignment and attract some¬thing really interesting like a black dragon or a sphinx! Or a stone giant!
Unlike followers, allies don’t actually work for you, as they are often way more powerful than your charac¬ter. You can’t give them orders and expect them to obey. But they are interested in helping you. They are local personalities who’ve been watching your development, they approve, and they arrive interested in doing you a favor.
