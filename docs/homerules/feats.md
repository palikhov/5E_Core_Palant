# Feats 
Warriors across the Forgotten Realms have spent years perfecting the art of combat. Over the years, masters
of various weapons and styles of combat have taken on apprentices and formed schools to pass on their techniques.
When you join a combat school, by taking the Combat School Training feat, you gain the journeyman benefits of that combat school. You gain the master benefits once you take the feat a second time. Once you join a combat school, you cannot join another one until you are a master in your first combat school.
Most combat schools have prerequisites that must be met before you join them. You can join a combat school at the same time as you meet its prerequisites.

All combat schools grant a mixture of maneuvers and techniques, as well as some physical training. Combat schools require specific weapons or combinations of weapons. You cannot use the maneuvers or techniques from a combat school unless you are both proficient in and wielding the school’s specified weapons.

Combat schools use resolve to power their maneuvers and techniques. If a maneuver or a technique requires a saving throw, your combat school will tell you how to determine the DC.

Maneuvers: These are the signature moves of a school and require the expenditure of resolve dice. You can use only one maneuver per attack.

Physical Training: When you first join a combat school, you can increase one of your attributes, reflecting the training you receive. 

Techniques: These are the skills of a school. They do not require resolve dice and grant a passive benefit if you are using the combat school’s weapons.

**Resolve:** Martial maneuvers and techniques require cunning, strength, timing and panache, all of which are represented by resolve dice. Resolve dice are d6’s. You recover all expended resolve die after completing a short or long rest.

When you take the Combat School Training feat a second time to become a master in a combat school, your resolve die increases to a d8.
```
## Combat style feats

**Stance:** You may only utilize one stance feat at a time. You must use a bonus action to enter a stance and you can switch stances as a bonus action.
The following core feats are now treated as (stance) feats:
• Dual Wielder
• Great Weapon Master
• Polearm Master
• Shield Master
• Sentinel

Tier: Some feats possess more than one rank of abilities (initiate, journeyman, and master). When you first take a btiered feat you learn the initial abilities. You may take the feat a second and then third time to learn the journeyman and master level abilities. 
```
# Combat School Training

**Prerequisite:** You cannot have the Personal Combat Style feat, and you must meet the prerequisites of your chosen combat school.
```
You have gained acceptance into a school that teaches a combat style.
```
When you first take this feat, you must choose a combat school to join and you gain 2 resolve dice. Combat schools are found at the end of this chapter. You must be proficient in the weapons your chosen school teaches and you must wield those weapons to gain any benefits from your chosen school. You gain the **first tier (journeyman)** benefits of your chosen school.

You may take this feat again to gain the **next tier (master)** benefits of your chosen school. When you take this feat again to become a master of your chosen school, your resolve die changes to a d8 and you gain an additional resolve die.
