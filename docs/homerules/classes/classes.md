## Domain of Destruction

Destruction Domain \(Twitter\)

\[**Note: this subclass is likely not intended as official content:** "For the curious, when building stuff for my own campaign I kind of don't care about balance. Anything I can break in design I can counterbreak five times as bad during a session, as needed. Plus, IMO stuff going sideways and weird is why I play the game." — [Mike Mearls](https://twitter.com/mikemearls/status/1015752965213204480)\]

Custom built for clerics of Gruumsh, and perhaps Tiamat.

At each indicated cleric level, you add the listed spells to your spells prepared.

### Tactical Focus

At 3rd level, your tactical acumen allows you to study an area of a battlefield and provide direction to your allies that can tilt a battle in your favor.

As a bonus action or as part of the attack action, you can select an area on the ground that measures 10 feet on each side. This area is your tactical focus. It remains your tactical focus until you use this ability again or you are unable to take actions.

When you select an area as your tactical focus, you choose one of your tactics to apply to that area. You gain three tactics at 3rd level. You gain an additional tactic at 7th and 15 level. Each time you complete a long rest, you can swap on of your tactics for a different one.

### Tactics.

#### Advance. 

You and your allies can move 10 ft. in your tactical focus for every 5 feet of movement expended there.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Changed during stream to "You and your allies can basically teleport into your focus. Movement on allies turn." Specifically, the movement is not made as a reaction—your allies can use their movement on their turn\(s\) to move towards the focus, and gain bonuses to speed or other effects \(for example, ignoring difficult terrain, or movement does not provoke opportunity attacks\) to aid and incentivize this. Additionally, this may replace "Cover That Flank" in future.
{% endhint %}

####  Clear the area. 

If an ally hits a creature in your tactical focus with an attack, the ally can move that creature 5 ft. in addition to the attack's other effects.

#### Cover That Flank. 

When a hostile creature that you can see enters your tactical focus, up to three target creatures of your choice that can see the creature can use a reaction to move up to their speed. The targets must end their movement in the tactical focus. A target creature that ends this movement adjacent to the triggering creature regains its reaction.

#### Form Shield Wall. 

Allies in your tactical focus gain a +2 bonus to AC while they are adjacent to an ally using a shield. 

{% hint style="warning" %}
\[In future, this will likely be changed to benefit only creatures not already wielding a shield, and to affect each creature at most once.\]
{% endhint %}

#### Get Down. 

If an allied creature in your tactical focus must make a Dexterity saving throw it can use its reaction to move up to its speed. If this movement takes it out of the range or area of the effect that caused the saving throw, it is no longer subjected to the effect. \[In future, this may be changed to instead give advantage on the saving throw, or require the creature to drop prone, or cancel the creature's next move.\]

#### Reorder Ranks. 

Allies in your tactical focus do not provoke opportunity attacks while they are within 5 feet of an ally. In addition, you and your allies can end movement in an ally's space. That ally immediately moves so that you do not occupy the same space, but it must end that move at least partially occupying your tactical focus. 

{% hint style="warning" %}
\[Noted as requiring cleanup.\]
{% endhint %}



The stratagems are presented in alphabetical order.

### Tactician's Insight

Starting at 3rd level, you can grant your allies useful tactical insights while they are in the area of your tactical focus.

You gain a number of uses of insight based on your fighter level.

As a bonus action or as a part of an attack action you grant insight to yourself or allies in your tactical focus. You grant this benefit to yourself and as many allies as you wish in your focus, but you cannot expend more uses than you currently have 

{% hint style="warning" %}
\[or more than the maximum in the table below. A creature can receive more than one Tactician's Insight when you take this action.\]
{% endhint %}

A creature that gains your insight can use it in two ways. It can regain hit points immediately upon receiving it. Roll 2d10 and the creature regains that many hit points. If the creature would gain hit points that place it above its maximum, it gains the difference as temporary hit points.

Alternatively, a creature can save the insight to use when it hits with an attack. It increases the attack's damage by 2d10.

You regain expended uses of Tactician's Insight when you complete a long rest.

Hostile creatures within 60 feet of you that can see you must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, a creature is frightened of your tactical focus.

On a failed saving throw, the creature is stunned until the end of your next turn.

As part of this gambit, you may take the attack action.

When a creature you can see attacks a target other than you that is within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on the attack roll and make an opportunity attack against the attacker. You must be wielding a shield.

#### Superior Two-Weapon Fighting. 

When you engage in two-weapon fighting, you can add your ability modifier to the damage of the second attack. You gain a +1 bonus to AC while you are wielding a separate melee weapon in each hand.

# Monk - Way of the Soul Knife

Monks of the Way of the Soul Knife are deadly assassins and bounty hunters. They use their psionic talents to manifest psionic blades that tear through their enemies' bodies and psychic auras. Their talents extend beyond combat, as their ability to perceive auras allows them to track down foes and see through their deceptions.

## Soul Knife

Starting when you choose this tradition at 3rd level, you can use your psionic energy to manifest blades that disrupt your foes' minds.

Your unarmed strikes deal your choice of psychic, piercing, slashing, or bludgeoning damage each time you hit.

In addition, you can use a bonus action to increase the reach of your unarmed strikes by 30 feet until the end of your turn.

## Psychic Slash

At 3rd level, when you channel ki into your attacks you augment your soul knives to inflict devastating psionic attacks.

Whenever you hit a creature with one of the attacks granted by your Flurry of Blows and that attack inflicts psychic damage, you can impose one of the following effects on the target:

* Life Drain. You gain temporary hit points equal to half the damage your attack deals.
* Invoke Terror. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of you until the end of your next turn.
* Invoke Wrath. The target suffers disadvantage on all attack rolls against targets other than you until the end of your next turn.
* Astral Slide. You teleport the target up to 10 feet to a destination you can see.
* Synaptic Overload. The target gains vulnerability to psychic damage until the end of your next turn.

## Way of the Soul Knife \(Livestream\): Aura Sight

At 6th level, you gain the ability to perceive the auras of other creatures.

As an action, select a creature that you can see. That creature makes a Wisdom saving throw, though it has no knowledge that you forced it to attempt this saving throw. On a failed save, you learn if the creature shares and aspects of its alignment with you, its current hit points, and its current attitude and intentions toward you or one other creature, object, or location of your choice. In addition, for the next 24 hours or until you use this ability again, you can use an action to determine the creature's distance and direction from you.

If a creature succeeds on its saving throw against this ability, you cannot use this ability against that creature again until you complete a long rest.

## Way of the Soul Knife \(Livestream\): Spectral Blades

At 11th level, you can cause your blades to phase through physical objects and defenses.

Once during your turn, you can choose to forego one unarmed strike in place of forcing a creature within the reach of that attack to make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed saving throw, it takes your unarmed strike's damage, or half that damage if it succeeds.

## Way of the Soul Knife \(Livestream\): Psychic Form

At 17th level, you can transform your physical body into the same psychic energy that comprises your soul knives. As a bonus action, you gain resistance to all types of damage, a fly speed of 30 feet, and the ability to pass through solid objects but not end your movement within them. This benefit lasts for 1 minute. You cannot use it again until you complete a long rest.

Manifesting 
Psionics 
Manifesting a psionic effect or ability follows similar 
rules as those used for spell casting with two significant 
differences: spell components are replaced with power 
displays, and psionics are grouped by discipline.

Power Displays 
Manifesting psionics is an act of pure will. When you 
manifest a psionic ability or effect you do not use spell 
casting material components, there are no words spoken, 
and no hand movements to manipulate the Arcanum. 
Instead, any time you manifest a spell-like effect, the base 
spell’s components are replaced with power displays. Verbal 
(V) components are replaced with Visual (V) displays, 
Somatic (S) components with Sonic (S), and finally 
Material (M) components with Mental (M) displays. 
These displays are not disruptive to a creature’s 
concentration.
Visual (V) displays: Your eyes burn like points of silver 
fire when you manifest, and lasts as long as the ability or 
effect remains active. Expressions are also accompanied 
with displays which relate to the ability or effect’s function. 
Hold person, for example, may appear as transparent chains 
springing from the ground to wrap around your target, 
while telekinetic bolt might ripple the air between you and 
your target. These displays are unique to the individual 
psion, and are commonly seen as their personal “signature”. 
Some abilities and effects may describe their special visual 
displays.
Sonic (S) displays: A bass-pitched hum, eerily akin to 
many deep-pitched voices, issues from either your vicinity 
or your target’s vicinity (your choice). The sound grows 
within a second from being hardly noticeable to a shout 
loud enough to be heard within 50 feet. At your option, 
the instantaneous sound can instead be so soft that it can 
be heard only within 15 feet. Some abilities and effects may 
describe their special auditory displays. 
Mental (M) displays: A subtle chime rings once in the 
minds of creatures within 15 feet of either you or your 
target (your choice). You may choose to have the chime 
ring continuously for the duration of the ability or effect. 
Some abilities and effects may describe their special mental 
displays. 

Psionic Disciplines 
Abilities and effects are categorized into the broad groups 
below. This categorization has no inherent effect, but other 
abilities, effects, and features will reference these categories.
Clairsentience: Disciplines that extend the senses and 
gathering information.
Metacreation: Disciplines that bring objects into 
existence.
Metapsionic: Disciplines that modify expressions.
Psychometabolism: Disciplines that enhance the body 
and improve its functions.
Psychoportation: Disciplines that move creatures and 
objects from place to place.
Telekinesis: Disciplines that use the power of the mind 
to move objects or manipulate force.
Telepathy: Disciplines that link minds together and 
manipulate thought patterns.
Psionic Actions 
Psionic powers are treated as cantrips, unless you use the 
power’s expression. Expressions, regardless of the source 
(psionic power, discipline or class ability), are the equivalent 
of casting a spell. As with magic’s restriction of casting only 
one spell during a turn, only one psionic ability or effect 
can be manifested during a turn.
Persistent and focused abilities are considered class 
features, and are not limited by the one manifestation per 
turn rule. 
Psionics and Magic 
The abilities of the Awakened may be vastly different from 
those of clerics and sorcerers, but they still draw on the 
residual energy of Creation to produce magical effects. 
Psionic expressions are treated as spells, and psionic powers 
are treated as cantrips for the purpose of dispel magic, 
counterspell, and defenses such as globe of invulnerability, 
unless otherwise stated in the description of the ability. 
Psionic abilities and effects that force a saving throw or 
require an attack roll can be targeted by counterspell, 
dispel magic, and are blocked by defenses such as globe of 
invulnerability unless otherwise stated. 

Psionic 
Disciplines
Disciplines are mental techniques that permanently open 
metaphysical pathways, allowing the Awakened to unlock 
abilities and effects powered by mere acts of will.
All disciplines grant you a list of focused abilities, 
persistent abilities, expressions, grand expressions, and spell 
expressions that become available to you as you advance in 
level. 
Focused abilities remain in effect as long as you have a 
Mental Focus dedicated to the ability. Becoming focused on 
an ability produces an M (mental) power display.
Persistent abilities are always available to you, and do not 
require a psionic focus. Unless otherwise noted, activating 
these powers require an action producing both V (visual) 
and S (sonic) power displays. These powers are manifested 
at a level equal to your manifesting level and may be 
dispelled or countered. 
Expressions and Spell Expressions are more powerful 
effects and abilities that require you to expend a mental 
focus, ending the focused ability which that focus was 
maintaining. Unless otherwise noted, expending an active 
mental focus requires an action. These effects and spells 
function at a spell level equal to your manifesting level. 
Expressions that do not replicate a spell produce both V 
(visual) and M (mental) power displays.
Grand Expressions are the most powerful psionic 
capabilities known, often equalling the most powerful 
spells and abilities. Grand expressions are manifested by 
the creation and collapse of a powerful thought form, 
something like a psychic “big bang”, all occurring in the 
blink of an eye. Unless otherwise noted, manifesting a 
grand expression requires an action. These effects and spells 
are manifested at a spell level equal to your manifesting 
level. Grand expressions produce both V (visual) and M 
(mental) power displays, as well as a sharp, loud “pop” like a 
gunshot at the moment the grand expression is manifested.

Psion Power List  

Clairsentience  
The psion’s senses can evolve such that they become more acute, 
and ultimately those senses extend beyond space and purpose, 
even beyond time itself. Clairsentience is a discipline that 
allows the mind of the psion to sense beyond the physical realm. 
Spell Expressions: As you advance in level, you learn 
to manifest the following spells as expressions, which are 
manifested at your manifesting level. 
Psion Level Spell Expression
1st level guiding bolt
3rd level find traps
5th level clairvoyance
7th level arcane eye
9th level legend lore
In addition, as a clairsentient you gain the following 
effects and abilities as you gain levels in the Psion class:
1st Level Psion
Heightened Awareness
Your subconscious maintains vigilant scrutiny of your 
surroundings.
You learn the psionic power sensitivity to psionic 
impressions.
Focused Ability: You may use your manifesting ability 
score as a substitute for Wisdom when calculating your 
passive and active perception checks. If Wisdom is already 
your manifesting ability, then you apply double your 
proficiency bonus on Perception (Wisdom) checks. 
2nd Level Psion
Enhanced Sight
You have expanded not only what you can see, but how you see it.
Persistent: You have darkvision 60 feet, doubling the 
range of your darkvision if you already possess it. At 5th 
level psion you may spend a bonus action to gain advantage 
on any Perception (Wisdom) check. Finally starting at the 
12th psion level you gain blindsight 10 feet.
5th Level Psion
Expanded Awareness 
You can focus, expand, and extend your senses, seeing and 
hearing nearby locations. 
Focused Ability: After a minute of mediation you can 
touch any door or wall no thicker than 6” thick and see 
and hear what lies up to 10 feet away from the other side 
of the object. 

9th Level Psion
Sensory Veil
With mere force of will you erect a field that deflects most forms 
of magical detection. 
Focused Ability: You may manifest the spell non-
detection upon yourself, at will, without the expenditure of a 
psionic focus.
11th Level Psion
The Third Eye
You manifest your psychic third eye, allowing you to see all 
things as they truly are.
Grand Expression: You manifest the spell true seeing 
upon yourself.
13th Level Psion
Precognition 
Your awakened senses flash briefly into the future, warning you 
of danger.
Focused Ability: You cannot be surprised.
Grand Expression: You manifest the spell fate of one*.
15th Level Psion
Inflict Sensory Overload 
For the untrained, the gift of clairsentience is debilitating and 
overwhelming, shattering the unprepared mind. 
Grand Expression: You manifest the spell feeblemind.
17th Level Psion
Prescience
Your senses extend beyond time itself, allowing you to discern 
the immediate future with perfect clarity.
Grand Expression: You manifest the spell foresight upon 
yourself. 

Metacreation  
A powerful, trained mind can order and shape energy and 
matter as easily as one might organize toys in a playroom. 
Metacreation is a discipline allowing the psion to transform 
and create objects. 

Spell Expressions: As you advance in level, you learn 
to manifest the following spells as expressions, which are 
manifested at your manifesting level. 

Psion Level Spell Expression
1st level shield
3rd level storm of knives
5th level phantasmal steed 
7th level fabricate 
9th level wall of force
In addition, as a metacreator you gain the following 
effects and abilities as you gain levels in the Psion class:
1st Level Psion
Psi Crystal
You create a physical expression of your psyche.
You learn the psionic power luminescent crystals. 
Focused Ability: You manifest a psi crystal. See the 
psi crystal side bar for complete stats and capabilities. 
Additionally, as you advance in level your psi crystal has the 
following abilities:
Starting at 5th level psion, your psi crystal gains the 
ability to manifest the powers mind thrust and telekinetic 
bolt utilizing your Manifesting Attack Bonus/saving 
throw DC.
Starting at 5th level psion, when you take the attack 
action, you can forgo one of your own attacks to allow your 
psi crystal to make one attack of its own, using its reaction. 
Starting at 11th level psion, your psi crystal manifests 
powers as if it was half your level, and as a bonus action 
you can have your psi crystal make one attack, using its 
reaction. 
Expression: As a reaction you may teleport your psi 
crystal back to a space adjacent to you. 
2nd Level Psion
Crystalline Armor
You create a suit of meta-physical crystalline armor about 
your body.
Persistent: As an action, you manifest a spell-like ability 
that mimics the spell mage armor at will without the use 
of a focus. This creates a suit of meta-physical crystalline 
armor that improves as you become more experienced:
Upon reaching 5th level psion, you may choose to 
manifest crystalline chain mail. 
Upon reaching 9th level psion, you may choose to 
manifest crystalline splint mail. 
Upon reaching 11th level psion, you may choose to 
manifest crystalline plate armor. 
Unlike “real” suits of armor, meta-physical crystalline 
armor does not have a minimum Strength requirement, 
weighs half as much as a real suit of armor, and does not 
impose disadvantage on stealth checks. This effect ends 
prematurely if you don real armor, however you may use a 
shield while clad in your manifested armor.

5th Level Psion 
Crystalline Cocoon 
You can create a temporary shelter made of crystal. Though not 
as strong as some grand expressions, it is serviceable enough.
Focused Ability: As an action you manifest a solid 
cocoon around yourself, initiating a long rest. This 
cocoon is solid, air and water tight, and invulnerable to 
damage. The duration of this effect is 8 hours, no more 
or less, and must run its entire course once initiated. 
The psion is in a deep sleep while under the effect of the 
coccon. At its conclusion, the coccon shatters into dust, 
leaving the occupant awake, and thoroughly rested as if 
under the effect of  enhanced ability: bear’s endurance spell 
for one hour.
9th Level Psion 
Crystal Shaping 
You can shape your memories into crystalline objects which 
provide you a measure of defense. 
Focused Ability: You may manifest shields of crystalized 
memories allowing you to deflect attacks directed against 
you. When an attacker that you can see hits you with 
an attack, you can use your reaction to halve the attack’s 
damage against you.
Expression: You may manifest a small crystalline wall as 
a bonus action. This wall is made up of four 10-foot square 
panels. Each panel must be contiguous with another panel. 
In any form, the wall is 1” thick.
The wall is an object that can be damaged and thus 
breached. It has AC 12 and 30 hit points per 10-foot 
section, and it is vulnerable to fire damage. Reducing a 
10-foot section of wall to 0 hit points destroys the section 
forcing any creature adjacent to the destroyed section to 
make a Charisma saving throw, suffering 3d6 psychic 
damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a 
successful one. Once manifested this wall remains for 5 
minutes and requires concentration to maintain. 
11th Level Psion
Shards Barrier 
Your ability to manipulate force is second to none
Grand Expression: You manifest the spell blade barrier.
13th Level Psion
Crystalline Storm
With your force of will you summon shimmering shards 
representing multiple aspects of your personality, which possess 
unique effects when they strike. 
Grand Expression: You manifest the spell prismatic spray

Your will wraps itself around an opponent, altering their 
matter and transforming them into crystal. 
Grand Expression: You manifest the spell crystalize*.
17th Level Psion
Shard of Anguish
You summon a magnificent shard of innumerable facets 
imbued with all the sadness, pain, regret, anger, and fear you 
have accumulated in your life. The shard floats in the air, 
projecting a rainbow-hued wall of malignancy.
Grand Expression: You manifest the spell prismatic wall.
Metapsionics  
 It can be argued that Metapsionics is not a proper discipline, 
as it seems to only focus on changing and manipulating powers 
already possessed by an individual psion, but masters of this 
tradition strongly disagree. They master manipulating their 
psionic powers in ways others can only dream of doing. 
Spell Expressions: As you advance in level, you learn 
to manifest the following spells as expressions, which are 
manifested at your manifesting level. 
Psion Level Spell Expression
1st level identify
3rd level magic weapon
5th level dispel magic, counter spell
In addition, as a psi manipulator you gain the following

dice from the chosen psionic attack power among multiple 
targets. Take the pool of damage dice and split them

Attack Power has a secondary effect, apply the effect to all 
targets per the power’s description.

Focused Ability: Increase the range of your psionic

forces other creatures to make a saving throw, you may 
choose a number of creatures up to your manifesting 
modifier (minimum of one creature). A chosen creature

equal to your manifesting ability modifier, regaining all 
expended uses after completing a long rest.

Rapid Mind
Your mind can manifest psionic effects with impressive speed.
You learn an additional psionic power of your choice 
from the Psion psionic power list.

Heightened Expression
Persistent: When you manifest a spell or ability that 
forces a creature to make a saving throw to resist its effects, 
you may use a bonus action to give one target of the spell/
ability disadvantage on its first saving throw made against 
it, regaining the ability to do so after completing a short 
rest.
17th Level Psion
Psychic Empowerment
Persistent: After you successfully hit a creature with a 
psionic power or spell expression you may reroll a number 
of damage die equal to your Manifesting ability modifier 
and choose the higher result, regaining the ability to do so 
after completing a short rest.

Psychometabolism 
The psychometabilism discipline enables the psion to control 
and manipulate their flesh, muscle, and biology so that they 
may truly become superhuman. 
Spell Expressions: As you advance in level, you learn 
to manifest the following spells as expressions, which are 
manifested at your manifesting level. 
Psion Level Spell Expression

Your mental focus improves your body and your athleticism 
improves your mind.
You know the psionic power amplified physique.

Strength and Dexterity when attempting any (Dexterity) 
Acrobatics and (Strength) Athletics check. 
2nd Level Psion
Subconscious Weapon Mastery 
Your mind programs your muscle memory so that your balance, 
speed, and strength function in perfect synchronicity with a 
weapon of choice.
Persistent: You may spend a bonus action to harmonize 
to the resonance of a particular weapon. If you are not 
proficient with it, you become so. You remain harmonized 
to the weapon as long as it remains in your grasp. While 
wielding this weapon, you make attacks using your 
Manifesting Attack Modifier and deal damage equal to the 
weapon’s damage plus your Manifesting ability modifier 
(instead of Strength or Dexterity). 
Starting at 5th level psion, you can attack with your 
harmonized weapon twice, instead of once, whenever you 
take the Attack action on your turn. 
Starting at 9th level psion, you now deal additional 
damage with your harmonized weapon, equal to your 
Strength or Dexterity bonus as appropriate to the weapon. 
Starting at 11th level psion, your successful attacks with 
your harmonized weapon deal an additional 1d6 force 
damage.
Harmonized weapons are considered magical for the 
purpose of overcoming resistance.
5th Level Psion
Adrenaline Control 
Your mastery of self allows you taps deep reserves of inner 
strength.
Focused Ability: You may use a bonus action to flood 
your system with adrenaline. Until the end of your next 
turn you gain advantage on Strength checks and saving 
throws while your melee attacks gain a +2 bonus to damage, 
but doing so can be quite strenuous. If you use this ability 
a number of turns equal to your Constitution bonus in 1 
minute you gain 1 level of exhaustion until you complete a 
short rest.

9th Level Psion
Adaptable Physiology 
Your body and appearance are but a canvas to reflect your will, 
changing as if clay in a sculptor’s hands.

11th Level Psion
Ignore Pain
You can overcome pain by shunting it into a small corner of 
your mind.

the poisoned condition and up to 2 levels of exhaustion. If 
you surpass 2 levels of exhaustion this ability has no effect. 
This ability does not remove these conditions, it simply 
suppresses them.
Grand Expression: You manifest the spell heal upon 
yourself.
13th Level Psion
Mastery of Self
You have completely mastered your body though the power of 
your mind. 
Grand Expression: You manifest the spell regeneration 
upon yourself.
15th Level Psion
Subconscious Healing 
Sometimes your subconscious can act of its own accord.
Grand Expression: When you are reduced to zero hit 
points, as a reaction, you may choose to manifest this grand 
expression which instantly heals hit points equal to 4d10 + 
your psion level.

Skin of Iron
With a moment of concentration you can make your body 
virtually indestructible. 
Grand Expression: As an action you may grant yourself 
resistance to all damage for 10 minutes. 
Psychoportation 
For the psion, distance and space are illusions, artificial 
limitations that are easily overcome by the mind. The 
psychoportation discipline enables psions to escape the shackles 
of location and distance, transferring matter through space.
Spell Expressions: As you advance in level, you learn 
to manifest the following spells as expressions, which are 
manifested at your manifesting level. 


Arc anis 5e • Chap ter 7: Psionics 296

Psion Level Spell Expression
1st level longstrider
3rd level misty step

about like pieces on a game board.
You learn the psionic power burst.

creature adjacent to you to make a Wisdom saving throw or 
be teleported to an unoccupied location which you can see

swap places with any willing creature within 30 feet, who 
then becomes the target of the attack. 
2nd Level Psion
Distant Steps
To your expanded mind, all places are one.
Persistent: You may use a bonus action to instantly 
teleport yourself to an unoccupied location which you can 
clearly see within 10 feet. 
Starting at 5th level psion, your range increases to 15 feet. 
Starting at 11th level psion, using this ability grants 
you advantage on your first attack or psionic manifesting 
roll performed before the end of your turn. You may use 
the resulting advantage a number of times equal to your 
Manifesting ability modifier, regaining all expended uses 
after completing a long rest.
5th level Psion
Spatial Anchor
You feel the ebb and flow of movement around you, and those 
who try to teleport do so only with your consent.
Focused Ability: Anyone attempting to teleport or use 
any kind of planar travel (such as misty step and blink) 
within 60 feet of you must make Wisdom saving throw to 
do so. Your use of psychoportation is unrestricted by your 
spatial anchor, but you can be affected by another creature’s 
spatial anchor. 

9th level Psion
Spatial Repositioning
Your ability to move creatures has improved.
Focused Ability: You may manifest forceful repositioning* 
at will, without expending a mental focus.

Violent Spatial Displacement 
You teleport parts of a target to various places, simultaneously. 
Grand Expression: You manifest the spell disintegrate. 
13th level Psion 
Spatial Asylum
You can create a mental focal point which you may return to at 
a moment’s notice.
Persistent: You may spend 10 minutes to designate a 
specific point as your asylum. When you designate a new 
location as your asylum you lose the connection to your 
previous asylum.

of your asylum, as an action you may teleport yourself to it, 
appearing in the nearest unoccupied space to the spot you 
designated when you prepared your asylum. 
15th level Psion

You fling your enemy across the planes into a pocket dimension 
that temporarily imprisons them.

creatures within 10 feet of you. Those creatures must make 
a successful Charisma saving throw or gain the restrained 
condition while they are teleported 30 feet away to an 
unoccupied space of your choosing. Creatures effected 
remain restrained for 1 minute but may attempt a Charisma 
saving throw at the end of their turns to end the condition. 
On a successful save the targets are still teleported in a 
straight line from you to an unoccupied square with 10 feet. 
Telekinesis 
For the psion, thought can give rise to form. When a psion 
combines rigorous training with violent intent, their thoughts 
manifest as force. Telekinesis is the discipline that turns thought 
into force.


Spell Expressions: As you advance in level, you learn 
to manifest the following spells as expressions, which are 
manifested at your manifesting level.

senses.

psyche onto the psyche of another creature. Choose a 
creature within 60 feet who must make a Charisma saving 
throw or become subject to a strong telepathic bond of 
which they are unaware. During the next 24 hours you may 
use a bonus action to see through your target’s eyes and 
hear what it hears until the start of your next turn, gaining 
the benefits of any special senses that the creature has. Once 
the bond is established, its range is unlimited as long as you 
and the target are on the same plane of existence. While

hostile toward you.

number of creatures within 30 feet and force them to make 
a Wisdom saving throw. Targets that fail their saving throw 
are stunned until the end of your next turn due to the 
psychological trauma, as their last 10 minutes of memory 
becomes an unrecognizable blur. Memories remain lost until 
the target is treated with a greater restoration or similar ability. 
This ability is ineffective against constructs or undead.
Psionic 
Powers
Psionic powers are rudimentary psionic abilities, similar to 
the cantrips used by arcane spell casters. A power allows 
you to manifest its base effect without the expenditure of a 
psionic focus. Additionally, each power has an additional 
expression that does require the expenditure of a psionic 
focus. Some of these expressions give you access to effects 
that mimic spells, while others improve upon the power’s 
base ability. Access to these expressions are reliant upon 
your expression level.

touched by a creature). Some examples are opening an 
unlocked door or container, stow or retrieve an item from 
an open container, or pour the contents out of a vial. You 
can move objects 30 feet per turn. You cannot use this 
power to attack, activate magic items, or carry more than 
10 pounds.

At 5th level psion, while maintaining concentration 
on this ability, you can use a reaction to assist another 
character, granting them advantage on any Strength 
(Athletics) check.

suffers damage normally but is 
inflicted with a telepathically charged 
mental trap. Until the end of its 
next turn, the first time your target 
attacks anyone other than you, it 
suffers 1d6 psychic damage. This

attack deals an extra 1d6 psychic 
damage, while the damage suffered 
for attacking someone other than 
you is increased to 2d6. At 11th level 
psion, the damage further increases 
to 2d6/3d6, and finally increasing to 
3d6/4d6 at 17th level psion.

opponent with this power, you may 
choose to expend a psionic focus 
to increase the power’s effect by an

mimics the spell expeditious retreat.
3rd level expression: You may manifest a spell-like effect 
that mimics the spell haste.
9th level expression: You may manifest this power 
as part of a Dash action. If you do so, you triple your 
movement rate, and can run across any liquid or hazardous 
surface without taking damage or suffering any condition 
effect. If you have not crossed the surface or hazard by 
the end of the movement, you suffer normal effects of the 
surface or hazard. (e.g., you can run across a field of lava, 
but if you don’t make it all the way across, you’re cooked.)
Ego Whip 
Telepathy power (attack)
Manifesting Time: 1 action 
Range: 120 feet 
Power Displays: V, M

You can destroy a creature’s confidence, filling them with self-
loathing and doubt.

make a Charisma saving throw or suffer disadvantage on 
saving throws and attack rolls until the end of their next 
turn. Additionally, the power’s damage is increased by an 
additional 2d6 psychic damage, which increases by 1d6 
psychic damage for each manifesting level above 1st, up to a 
maximum of 6d6 additional damage at the psion’s highest 
manifesting level.
Force Puppet
Telekinesis power (utility)
Manifesting Time: 1 action
Range: 60 feet
Power Displays: V, S, M
Duration: Concentration, 1 minute
You create a small construct of intention and telekinetic force. 
You manifest a small construct composed of your intent 
and telekinetic force. Once created, this creature is under 
your control until the power ends or until it is reduced 
to 0 hit points. Maintaining your force puppet takes an 
abnormal amount of concentration, requiring you to use an 
action every turn, to preserve its form. 
Your force puppet acts on your turn and may take its 
action as soon as it’s created. You must mentally direct your 
force puppet, requiring a bonus action, and only as long 
as it remains within 30 feet of you. You must decide what 
action it will take and where it will move, or you can issue 
a general command, such as to guard a particular person 
or attack a creature. If you issue no commands, your force 
puppet does nothing.
At 5th level psion, when a friendly creature adjacent to 
your force puppet is attacked, you may use your reaction to 
have your force puppet interpose itself between the friendly 
creature and their attacker, granting them half cover (+2 
bonus to AC and Dexterity saving throws). 
At 7th level psion, you have learned to compartmentalize 
the maintenance of the force puppet. It only takes a bonus 
action to maintain, though you still need to use an attack 
action to make the force puppet attack. 
At 11th level psion, you further compartmentalize the 
focus on the force puppet. You no longer need to use an 
action or bonus action to maintain the force puppet, and 
it will continue to attack the last target it was ordered to 
attack. As a bonus action, you can change the target of 
attack. 
At 17th level psion, your force puppet adds your 
proficiency bonus to all attack, saves, ability checks, and 
damage rolls. It also gains 20 hit points.
Your force puppet has the following stats:

power grants your construct more independence, infusing 
it with a reflection of your logical mind. You are no longer

As a bonus action on your turn, you can move the lights 
up to 60 feet to a new spot within range. A light must be

condition until the 
end of your next 
turn. Creatures 
who are immune to 
psychic damage 
automatically 
make their saving

this effect. Additionally, you increase the power’s damage

aware that it is beyond the barrier. Otherwise one foot of 
stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 
feet of wood blocks the power. You may send that creature 
a telepathic message and they can reply to you in the same

abilities and effects, and the presence of other Awakened 
creatures within 30 feet of you. You can see a faint aura 
around any Awakened creature or object in the area that

barriers, but it is blocked by 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of 
common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt.

The psion can detect the presence of a psionic echo left by 
traumatic events.
Traumatic events such as murder or torture always leave a 
psionic echo, of sorts. When you manifest this power you 
can detect the presence of traumatic psychic residue in a 
30-foot area around yourself. You can sense how long ago 
the event happened, and its general scale (e.g., many people 
have been tortured here over many years, someone was 
killed here last night, or someone was beaten and raped here 
a few weeks ago).
Expression: You gain greater insight on the events that 
created a psionic impression, as you discern a vision of the 
events that created the echo. These visions are dreamlike, 
lacking precise details, and although you cannot readily 
gain any special knowledge of anyone involved in the 
event, you find you can recall more general details such as 
the presence of a holy champion or fellow awakened val, a 
particular family banner, a signet on a ring, the weather, 
or even time of day the event took place. Witnessing these 
events leaves you paralyzed until the end of your next turn. 
At that time, you may attempt a DC 10 Wisdom (Insight) 
check to recall specific details, as provided by your GM.
