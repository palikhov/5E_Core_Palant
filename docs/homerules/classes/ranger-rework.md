# Stalker
```
OF COURSE WE CAN’T TRUST HIM, HE IS THE MURDERER, AFTER ALL. WAIT, YOU DIDN’T KNOW?

WELL, I CERTAINLY I WASN’T TRYING TO WITHHOLD THAT INFORMATION, I JUST THOUGHT THE WAY HE HELD HIS GOBLET MADE IT OBVIOUS.

--GWENDOLYN HOLMWOOD LAMPLIGHTER INSPECTOR-GENERAL
```

At first glance, you seem hopelessly out of place in an adventuring party, looking instead like a drab town dweller who has wandered into danger by mistake. You maintain a soft-spoken, rather nondescript demeanor, but this is only a facade, concealing keen senses, a shrewd mind, and remarkable insight. Only your closest friends realize the extent of your expertise in intelligence gathering. And that's just the way you like it.

Stalkers serve as investigators, spies, informants, interrogators, and vigilantes. Unlike other rangers, you are just as at home in a crowded metropolis as you are in a wilderness setting.

Like all rangers, you are a master of the hunt, but when your prey can be as intelligent, sophisticated, or devious as yourself, hunting them is a far more complex task. You are experienced in solving intricate mysteries and bringing justice to the masterminds behind ambitious crimes. As comfortable stalking your quarry in a bustling city as a savage wilderness, you are no mere urban ranger, but a master of observation, deduction, and interrogation.

A ranger with the Stalker archetype has the kinds of perceptive and investigative skills normally reserved for a rogue, and the sort of disciplined intellect nurtured by wizards or bards. They specialize in studying the appearance and other clues they can discern in a particular criminal or other opponent, gaining decisive advantages in bringing that specific foe to justice.

## STALKER MULTICLASSING

```
If you are using the optional multiclassing rules, rangers of this archetype gain a special benefit: they can substitute their Intelligence score for their Wisdom score when determining if they can be multiclass rangers.
```

## Accurate Mind

When you choose this martial archetype at 3rd level, you gain proficiency in the Insight, Investigation, and Perception skills. If you are already proficient in one or more of these skills, you may substitute proficiency in any other Intelligence- or Wisdom-based skill for any skill in which you are already proficient. You add double your proficiency bonus to your passive Perception, passive Investigation, and passive Insight scores, instead of your normal proficiency bonus.

In addition, when you gain this feature, you may choose to make Intelligence your ranger spellcasting ability score, instead of Wisdom, if you wish. 

## Detect & Deduce

At 3rd level, your deductive insights are unmatched. You gain three detection dice, which are d6s. As long as you retain at least one detection die, whenever you make an Intelligence (Investigation), Wisdom (Insight), or Wisdom (Perception) check, you can roll one your detection die and add the number rolled to your check. This use of a detetction die does not expend it.

If you roll an ability check that includes your detection die roll, after you see the number rolled, but before the DM determines the result, you can expend one detection die to grant an additional +10 bonus to that roll. An expended detection die is regained whenever you finish a short or long rest.

At 9 th level, your detection dice turn into d8s. At 13 th level, they turn into d10s. At 17th level, they turn into d12s.

## Stalker's Mark

Also at 3rd level, you can focus all your deductive insights on a single target and analyze how they can be defeated.

As a bonus action, you can make a Wisdom (Insight) check against a creature you can see that isn't incapacitated, opposed by the target's Charisma (Deception) check A creature that is your favored enemy has disadvantage on this opposed roll. If you succeed, you gain the following benefits against that creature:

* You gain a bonus to damage rolls against the creature. The bonus equals your Intelligence or Wisdom bonus (whichever is higher, minimum 1).

* Any attack roll you make against the creature is a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20 on the d20.

* If you reduce the creature to 0 hit points with any attack roll (melee or ranged), you can choose to knock the creature out instead of killing it. Make this choice the instant damage is dealt. A knocked out creature falls unconscious and is stable at 0 hit points.

* If you retain at least one of your detection dice, when you make Wisdom (Insight) and Intelligence checks to discern information about that creature, or Charisma checks to influence them, you can roll your detection die and add the number rolled to your check. This use of a detection die does not expend it.

* If the creature can hear and see you, as an action, you can attempt to instantly convince the creature not to act against your authority. You can expend a detection die and force the creature to make a Charisma saving throw. The DC equals 10 + your choice of your Wisdom or Intelligence modifier (if you are proficient in the Intimidation skill, you add your proficiency bonus as well). The creature has disadvantage on its saving throw if it has been reduced to half its hit points or fewer. If the creature fails, its speed is reduced by half, and every time it makes an attack roll against you or any ally you choose to include in this effect, it takes psychic damage equal to your proficiency bonus + your detection die roll. However, if you or any ally you included in this effect attack the creature, cast a spell that affects it, or compel it to make a saving throw, this effect ends at once.

These benefits only last for 1 minute. You can only gain these benefits against one creature at a time; if you use this feature on a new creature, any benefits you've gained against any other creature from this feature end immediately. You can only use this feature while you retain at least one detection die.

If you wish, when you use this feature on a creature as a bonus action, you can cast the hunter's mark spell on the creature as part of the same bonus action, using a ranger spell slot to cast that spell as you normally would.

## Penetrating Deduction

At 7th level, when you use your Stalker's Mark feature on a creature you have spent at least 1 minute interacting with or observing outside of combat during the past hour, you have advantage on the Wisdom (Insight) check. In addition, when you use your Stalker's Mark feature on a creature, you also learn something about them. The DM tells you if the creature is your equal, superior, or inferior in regard to two of the following characteristics of your choice:

* An ability score of your choice

* Armor Class

* Current hit points

* Total class levels (if any)

* Levels in a particular class (if any)

* At the DM's option, you might also realize you know a piece of the creature's history or one of its personality traits, if it has any.

## Urban Hunter

At 7th level, when you are within 1,000 ft. of any settlement that has a population of 100 or more, you gain all the benefits of being within your favored terrain.

## Twenty Moves Ahead

At 11th level, you can see through opponents' deceptions and anticipate their actions. All Charisma (Deception) checks against you are made at disadvantage. If a creature that is the target of your Stalker's Mark hits you with an attack roll, you can expend one of your detection dice as a reaction. You gain a bonus to your Armor Class against the triggering attack equal to your detection die roll. If the attack still hits, you have resistance against the damage it inflicts. If the attack misses, that creature provokes an opportunity attack from you. would.

## Improved Detection

Beginning at 11th level, you gain a fourth detection die. At 15th level, you gain a fifth detection die, and at 18th level, you gain a sixth. would.

## Reliable Deduction

Beginning at level, when a creature that you have successfully used your Stalker's Mark feature on within the last hour is also the target of your hunter's mark spell, you have advantage on attack rolls against that creature.

In addition, whenever you roll initiative and have no detection dice remaining, you regain 1 detection die.


# Revised Ranger

Favored Enemy Beginning at 1st level, you have significant experience studying, tracking, hunting, and even talking to a certain type of enemy commonly encountered in the wilds.

Choose a type of favored enemy: beasts, fey, humanoids, monstrosities, or undead. You gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with weapon attacks against creatures of the chosen type. Additionally, you have advantage on Wisdom \(Survival\) checks to track your favored enemies, as well as on Intelligence checks to recall information about them.

When you gain this feature, you also learn one language of your choice, typically one spoken by your favored enemy or creatures associated with it. However, you are free to pick any language you wish to learn.

Natural Explorer You are a master of navigating the natural world, and you react with swift and decisive action when attacked. This grants you the following benefits:

You ignore difficult terrain. You have advantage on initiative rolls. On your first turn during combat, you have advantage on attack rolls against creatures that have not yet acted. In addition, you are skilled at navigating the wilderness. You gain the following benefits when traveling for an hour or more:

Difficult terrain doesn't slow your group's travel. Your group can't become lost except by magical means. Even when you are engaged in another activity while traveling \(such as foraging, navigating, or tracking\), you remain alert to danger. If you are traveling alone, you can move stealthily at a normal pace. When you forage, you find twice as much food as you normally would. While tracking other creatures, you also learn their exact number, their sizes, and how long ago they passed through the area. Spellcasting By the time you reach 2nd level, you have learned to use the magical essence of nature to cast spells, much as a druid does. See chapter 10 for the general rules of spellcasting and chapter 11 for the ranger spell list.

Spell Slots The Ranger table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.

For example, if you know the 1st-level spell animal friendship and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast animal friendship using either slot.

Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher You know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the ranger spell list.

The Spells Known column of the Ranger table shows when you learn more ranger spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 5th level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.

Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the ranger spells you know and replace it with another spell from the ranger spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

Spellcasting Ability Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your ranger spells, since your magic draws on your attunement to nature. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a ranger spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier

Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier

Fighting Style At 2nd level, you adopt a particular style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the following options. You can't take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.

Archery You gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls you make with ranged weapons.

Defense While you are wearing armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC.

Dueling When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon.

Two-Weapon Fighting When you engage in two-weapon fighting, you can add your ability modifier to the damage of the second attack.

Primeval Awareness Beginning at 3rd level, your mastery of ranger lore allows you to establish a powerful link to beasts and to the land around you.

You have an innate ability to communicate with beasts, and they recognize you as a kindred spirit. Through sounds and gestures, you can communicate simple ideas to a beast as an action, and can read its basic mood and intent. You learn its emotional state, whether it is affected by magic of any sort, its short-term needs \(such as food or safety\), and actions you can take \(if any\) to persuade it to not attack.

You cannot use this ability against a creature that you have attacked within the past 10 minutes.

Additionally, you can attune your senses to determine if any of your favored enemies lurk nearby. By spending 1 uninterrupted minute in concentration \(as if you were concentrating on a spell\), you can sense whether any of your favored enemies are present within 5 miles of you. This feature reveals which of your favored enemies are present, their numbers, and the creatures' general direction and distance \(in miles\) from you.

If there are multiple groups of your favored enemies within range, you learn this information for each group.

Ranger Conclave At 3rd level, you choose to emulate the ideals and training of a ranger conclave from the list of available conclaves. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 5th, 7th, 11th, and 15th level.

Beast Conclave \(UA\) Many rangers are more at home in the wilds than in civilization, to the point where animals consider them kin. Rangers of the Beast Conclave develop a close bond with a beast, then further strengthen that bond through the use of magic.

Animal Companion At 3rd level, you learn to use your magic to create a powerful bond with a creature of the natural world.

With 8 hours of work and the expenditure of 50 gp worth of rare herbs and fine food, you call forth an animal from the wilderness to serve as your faithful companion. You normally select you companion from among the following animals: an ape, a black bear, a boar, a giant badger, a giant weasel, a mule, a panther, or a wolf. However, your DM might pick one of these animals for you, based on the surrounding terrain and on what types of creatures would logically be present in the area.

At the end of the 8 hours, your animal companion appears and gains all the benefits of your Companion's Bond ability. You can have only one animal companion at a time.

If your animal companion is ever slain, the magical bond you share allows you to return it to life. With 8 hours of work and the expenditure of 25 gp worth of rare herbs and fine food, you call forth your companion's spirit and use your magic to create a new body for it. You can return an animal companion to life in this manner even if you do not possess any part of its body.

If you use this ability to return a former animal companion to life while you have a current animal companion, your current companion leaves you and is replaced by the restored companion.

Companion's Bond Your animal companion gains a variety of benefits while it is linked to you.

The animal companion loses its Multiattack action, if it has one.

The companion obeys your commands as best it can. It rolls for initiative like any other creature, but you determine its actions, decisions, attitudes, and so on. If you are incapacitated or absent, your companion acts on its own.

When using your Natural Explorer feature, you and your animal companion can both move stealthily at a normal pace.

Your animal companion has abilities and game statistics determined in part by your level. Your companion uses your proficiency bonus rather than its own. In addition to the areas where it normally uses its proficiency bonus, an animal companion also adds its proficiency bonus to its AC and to its damage rolls.

Your animal companion gains proficiency in two skills of your choice. It also becomes proficient with all saving throws.

For each level you gain after 3rd, your animal companion gains an additional hit die and increases its hit points accordingly

Whenever you gain the Ability Score Improvement class feature, your companion's abilities also improve. Your companion can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or it can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, your companion can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature unless its description specifies otherwise.

Your companion shares your alignment, and has a personality trait and a flaw that you can roll for or select from the tables below. Your companion shares your ideal, and its bond is always, "The ranger who travels with me is a beloved companion for whom I would gladly give my life."

Your animal companion gains the benefits of your Favored Enemy feature, and of your Greater Favored Enemy feature when you gain that feature at 6th level. It uses the favored enemies you selected for those features.

Companion Trait d6 Trait 1 I'm dauntless in the face of adversity. 2 Threaten my friends, threaten me. 3 I stay on alert so others can rest. 4 People see an animal and underestimate me. 5 I have a knack for showing up in the nick of time. 6 I put my friends' needs before my own in all things. Companion Flaw d6 Flaw 1 If there's food left unattended, I'll eat it. 2 I growl at strangers, and all people except my ranger are strangers to me. 3 Any time is a good time for a belly rub. 4 I'm deathly afraid of water. 5 My idea of hello is a flurry of licks to the face. 6 I jump on creatures to tell them how much I love them. Gloom Stalker Gloom Stalkers are at home in the darkest places: deep under the earth, in gloomy alleyways, in primeval forests, and wherever else the light dims. Most folk enter such places with trepidation, but a Gloom Stalker ventures boldly into the darkness, seeking to ambush threats before they can reach the broader world. Such rangers are often found in the Underdark, but they will go any place where evil lurks in the shadows.

Gloom Stalker Magic Starting at 3rd level, you learn an additional spell when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown in the Gloom Stalker Spells table. The spell counts as a ranger spell for you, but it doesn't count against the number of ranger spells you know.

Gloom Stalker Spells Ranger Level Spells 3rd disguise self 5th rope trick 9th fear 13th greater invisibility 17th seeming Dread Ambusher At 3rd level, you master the art of the ambush. You can give yourself a bonus to your initiative rolls equal to your Wisdom modifier.

At the start of your first turn of each combat, your walking speed increases by 10 feet, which lasts until the end of that turn. If you take the Attack action on that turn, you can make one additional weapon attack as part of that action. If that attack hits, the target takes an extra 1d8 damage of the weapon's damage type.

Umbral Sight At 3rd level, you gain darkvision out to a range of 60 feet. If you already have darkvision from your race, its range increases by 30 feet.

You are also adept at evading creatures that rely on darkvision. While in darkness, you are invisible to any creature that relies on darkvision to see you in that darkness.

Horizon Walker Horizon Walkers guard the world against threats that originate from other planes or that seek to ravage the mortal realm with otherworldly magic. They seek out planar portals and keep watch over them, venturing to the Inner Planes and the Outer Planes as needed to pursue their foes. These rangers are also friends to any forces in the multiverse—especially benevolent dragons, fey, and elementals—that work to preserve life and the order of the planes.

Horizon Walker Magic Starting at 3rd level, you learn an additional spell when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown in the Horizon Walker Spells table. The spell counts as a ranger spell for you, but it doesn't count against the number of ranger spells you know.

See the "Planar Travel" section in chapter 2 of the Dungeon Master's Guide for examples of planar portals.

Planar Warrior At 3rd level, you learn to draw on the energy of the multiverse to augment your attacks.

As a bonus action, choose one creature you can see within 30 feet of you. The next time you hit that creature on this turn with a weapon attack, all damage dealt by the attack becomes force damage, and the creature takes an extra 1d8 force damage from the attack. When you reach 11th level in this class, the extra damage increases to 2d8.

Hunter Conclave \(UA\) Some rangers seek to master weapons to better protect civilization from the terrors of the wilderness. Members of the Hunter Conclave learn specialized fighting techniques for use against the most dire threats, from rampaging ogres and hordes of orcs to towering giants and terrifying dragons.

Hunter's Prey At 3rd level, you gain one of the following features of your choice: Colossus Slayer, Giant Killer, or Horde Breaker.

Colossus Slayer. Your tenacity can wear down the most potent foes. When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, the creature takes an extra 1d8 damage if it's below its hit point maximum. You can deal this extra damage only once per turn. Giant Killer. When a Large or larger creature within 5 feet of you hits or misses you with an attack, you can use your reaction to attack that creature immediately after its attack, provided that you can see the creature. Horde Breaker. Once on each of your turns when you make a weapon attack, you can make another attack with the same weapon against a different creature that is within 5 feet of the original target and within range of your weapon. Monster Slayer You have dedicated yourself to hunting down creatures of the night and wielders of grim magic. A Monster Slayer seeks out vampires, dragons, evil fey, fiends, and other magical threats. Trained in supernatural techniques to overcome such monsters, slayers are experts at unearthing and defeating mighty, mystical foes.

Monster Slayer Magic Starting at 3rd level, you learn an additional spell when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown in the Monster Slayer Spells table. The spell counts as a ranger spell for you, but it doesn't count against the number of ranger spells you know.

If the creature is hidden from divination magic, you sense that it has no damage immunities, resistances, or vulnerabilities.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier \(minimum of once\). You regain all expended uses of it when you finish a long rest.

Slayer's Prey Starting at 3rd level, you can focus your ire on one foe, increasing the harm you inflict on it. As a bonus action, you designate one creature you can see within 60 feet of you as the target of this feature. The first time each turn that you hit that target with a weapon attack, it takes an extra 1d6 damage from the weapon.

This benefit lasts until you finish a short or long rest. It ends early if you designate a different creature.

Ability Score Improvement When you reach 4th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

# Spell-less

Favored Enemy Beginning at 1st level, you have significant experience studying, tracking, hunting, and even talking to a certain type of enemy.

Choose a type of favored enemy: aberrations, beasts, celestials, constructs, dragons, elementals, fey, fiends, giants, monstrosities, oozes, plants, or undead. Alternatively, you can select two races of humanoid \(such as gnolls and orcs\) as favored enemies.

You have advantage on Wisdom \(Survival\) checks to track your favored enemies, as well as on Intelligence checks to recall information about them.

When you gain this feature, you also learn one language of your choice that is spoken by your favored enemies, if they speak one at all.

You choose one additional favored enemy, as well as an associated language, at 6th and 14th level. As you gain levels, your choices should reflect the types of monsters you have encountered on your adventures.

Natural Explorer You are particularly familiar with one type of natural environment and are adept at traveling and surviving in such regions. Choose one type of favored terrain: arctic, coast, desert, forest, grassland, mountain, swamp, or the Underdark. When you make an Intelligence or Wisdom check related to your favored terrain, your proficiency bonus is doubled if you are using a skill that you're proficient in.

While traveling for an hour or more in your favored terrain, you gain the following benefits:

Difficult terrain doesn't slow your group's travel. Your group can't become lost except by magical means. Even when you are engaged in another activity while traveling \(such as foraging, navigating, or tracking\), you remain alert to danger. If you are traveling alone, you can move stealthily at a normal pace. When you forage, you find twice as much food as you normally would. While tracking other creatures, you also learn their exact number, their sizes, and how long ago they passed through the area. You choose additional favored terrain types at 6th and 10th level.

Fighting Style At 2nd level, you adopt a particular style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the following options. You can't take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.

Archery You gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls you make with ranged weapons.

Defense While you are wearing armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC.

Dueling When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon.

Two-Weapon Fighting When you engage in two-weapon fighting, you can add your ability modifier to the damage of the second attack.

Combat Superiority At 2nd level, you learn maneuvers that are fueled by special dice called superiority dice.

Maneuvers You learn two maneuvers of your choice, which are chosen from the list of maneuvers available to fighters with the Battle Master archetype. Many maneuvers enhance an attack in some way. You can use only one maneuver per attack.

You learn one additional maneuver of your choice at 5th, 9th, 13th, and 17th levels. Each time you learn a new maneuver, you can also replace one maneuver you know with a different one.

Superiority Dice You have four superiority dice, which are d8s. A superiority die is expended when you use it. You regain all of your expended superiority dice when you finish a short or long rest.

You gain another superiority die at 9th level and one more at 17th level.

Saving Throws Some of your maneuvers require your target to make a saving throw to resist the maneuver's effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:

Maneuver save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength or Dexterity modifier \(your choice\)

Ranger Archetype At 3rd level, you choose an archetype that you strive to emulate from the list of available archetypes. Your choice grants features at 3rd level, and again at 7th, 11th, and 15th level.

Primeval Awareness Beginning at 3rd level, you can use your action to focus your awareness on the region around you. For the next minute, you can sense whether the following types of creatures are present within 1 mile of you \(or within up to 6 miles if you are in your favored terrain\): aberrations, celestials, dragons, elementals, fey, fiends, and undead. This feature doesn't reveal the creatures' location or number.

Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again

Poultices At 3rd level, you can create special herbal poultices that have healing power comparable to some potions. You can spend 1 hour gathering herbs and preparing herbal poultices using treated bandages to create a number of such poultices equal to your Wisdom modifier \(minimum 1\). You can carry a number of poultices at one time equal to your Wisdom modifier \(minimum 1\). The poultices you create cannot be applied by anyone but you. After 24 hours, any poultices that you have not used lose their potency.

If you spend 1 minute applying one of your poultices to a wounded humanoid creature, thereby expending its use, that creature regains 1d6 hit points for every two ranger levels you have \(rounded up\).

Ability Score Improvement When you reach 4th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

If your DM allows the use of feats, you may instead take a feat.

Extra Attack Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

Additional Maneuvers At 5th level, you learn one additional maneuver of your choice, which is chosen from the list of maneuvers available to fighters with the Battle Master archetype.

Land's Stride Starting at 8th level, moving through nonmagical difficult terrain costs you no extra movement. You can also pass through nonmagical plants without being slowed by them and without taking damage from them if they have thorns, spines, or a similar hazard.

In addition, you have advantage on saving throws against plants that are magically created or manipulated to impede movement, such those created by the entangle spell.

Hide in Plain Sight Starting at 10th level, you can spend 1 minute creating camouflage for yourself. You must have access to fresh mud, dirt, plants, soot, and other naturally occurring materials with which to create your camouflage.

Once you are camouflaged in this way, you can try to hide by pressing yourself up against a solid surface, such as a tree or wall, that is at least as tall and wide as you are. You gain a +10 bonus to Dexterity \(Stealth\) checks as long as you remain there without moving or taking actions. Once you move or take an action or a reaction, you must camouflage yourself again to gain this benefit.

One beast of challenge rating 2 or lower Two beasts of challenge rating 1 or lower Four beasts of challenge rating 1/2 or lower Eight beasts of challenge rating 1/4 or lower These beasts approach you from their current location, and will fight alongside you, attacking any creatures that are hostile to you. They are friendly to you and your comrades, and you roll initiative for the called creatures as a group, which takes its own turns. The DM has the creatures' statistics.

After 1 hour, these beasts return to their previous location. Once you use this feature, you cannot use it again in the same general area for 24 hours, since the same animals will not repeatedly heed your call.

Additional Maneuvers At 13th level, you learn one additional maneuver of your choice, which is chosen from the list of maneuvers available to fighters with the Battle Master archetype.

Vanish Starting at 14th level, you can use the Hide action as a bonus action on your turn. Also, you can't be tracked by nonmagical means, unless you choose to leave a trail.

You are also aware of the location of any invisible creature within 30 feet of you, provided that the creature isn't hidden from you and you aren't blinded or deafened.

Ability Score Improvement When you reach 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

If your DM allows the use of feats, you may instead take a feat.

Foe Slayer At 20th level, you become an unparalleled hunter of your enemies. Once on each of your turns, you can add your Wisdom modifier to the attack roll or the damage roll of an attack you make against one of your favored enemies. You can choose to use this feature before or after the roll, but before any effects of the roll are applied.

# Ranger spell-less (Arcanis)


The WflRDGR
He followed us for miles, though how he managed to sneak up behind us without Kvirk knowing I’ll never understand. The trees fell silent and though he never spoke, I sensed that he was keeping us in bow range. When he vanished amid a strange fog, Obser nudged me and winked. “Don’t be alarmed. He’s just one of the locals. ”
The paragons of the Eloran race, these elorii dedicate their entire lives to the protection of their people and the perfection of their culture. These elorii do not waste their time on frivolous things such as petty hobbies or vocations. Instead, they travel far and wide hoping to learn more about themselves. Once they have attained this focus, the warder dedicates the rest of their very long lives to the service of the elorii people. Some warders patrol the forests of the Elorii Nations, while others leave the safety of Belisarda’s domain to remove threats to their people more directly.
Race: Elorii Only
Additional Proficiencies: When you take this archetype you gain proficiency in Religion.

Sanctified Herbcraft
Beginning at 3rd level you learn how to infuse your herbalism with divine magic. When applying ointment of healing to a creature you may, as a bonus action, expend a spell level slot to have all die rolls with results equal to or less then the spell level slot used increased to the spell level slot used +1. (Example: When healing someone for 3d6 you expend a 2nd level spell slot and any die roll of 1, 2, or 3 is treated as if you rolled a 4.)

You prepare the list of warder spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the warder spell list. When you do so, choose a number of warder spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + half your ranger level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.
Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.
You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of cleric spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.
Spellcasting Ability
Wisdom is your spell casting ability score for warder spells. Your magic comes from your will and your convictions. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability.

Once you have stayed in a particular area (a 20 mile range of natural, mostly wild, terrain) for more than a week you may develop a powerful bond with the area, making it your hunter’s territory. Creating this bond requires a ritual lasting at least 8 hours, which can be done while preforming a long rest.
Once set you instantly know if you share your hunter’s territory with other elorii, and how many, but not their identity. While within your hunter’s territory you gain advantage on all Wisdom (Perception), Wisdom (Survival) and Dexterity (Stealth) checks.
Once you reach 11th level, and as long as you are on the same continent as your hunter’s territory, any time a sentient creature enters your hunter’s territory it must make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell casting DC. Upon a failed save you are alerted of its entry into your hunter’s territory and the general area in which it entered. If your hunter’s territory is above ground this ability detects intruders to a height of 60 feet, if below ground within the Endless Dark your hunter’s territory extends up 30 feet or to right below the surface and 30 feet below.
This bond remains as long as you spend at least one long rest a month within your territory, if you attempt to set another area as your territory, you must break the bond with your current territory.
Additionally, when not within your hunter’s territory but operating within one of your favored terrains you gain advantage on all Wisdom (Perception) and Intelligence (Investigation) checks.
Additional Fighting Style
At 11th level, you can choose a second option from the Fighting Style class feature.
Hunter's Instincts
Staring at 15 th level when you attack a creature by surprise who is set as your quarry you deal an additional 3d6 damage. Additionally, you may use a 4th level spell slot to cast tree stride while traveling within your territory and scrying to look in on any part of your territory.

hawk pin that these rangers use to signify their allegiance.
Talons of the Hawk train hard and study the
