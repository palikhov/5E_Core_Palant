## Equipment


###

**Armored Coat** Consisting of a short leather jacket reinforced with hidden metal plates, the protective natur of these jackets can be overlooked. Traditionally, they are fitted with hidden pockets and wrist scabbards that can hold a dagger or other small weapon.
This armor can be easily mistaken for normal clothing; any observer must succeed in a DC 15 Intelligence
(Investigation) check to recognize the true nature of the

**Kio Hauberk:** The kio hauberk uses many of the same techniques used to forge the famed kio swords. Metal rings are woven into quilted silk shirts with sleeves ending just above the elbow and flaps down the front and the back ending just below the knee. These flaps are commonly split, allowing the wearer to ride a horse. A coif and thick, metal ring-covered leather gloves typically accompany this armor. 
Like all kio-crafted goods, this armor is rare outside kio families.

**Lorica Segmentata:** The armor of the finest and bestequipped Coryani legions, lorica segmentata has seen many improvements over centuries of outstanding service to the Empire. It consists of steel plates bent and molded around the chest and shoulders, then linked together with steel mail worn beneath. Steel arm and leg greaves complete the kit. This armor is built for maximum protection and 
maneuverability.




**Buckler**: This small shield is fitted around the arm and made of metal, wood, or boiled leather. It takes the same time to don and doff as a normal shield \(1 action\) and a character cannot benefit from a buckler and any other type of shield at the same time. Unlike a shield, a character can still use the hand in which the buckler is equipped. If during a character's turn they use an item with this hand, attack with a weapon in this hand, or attack with a two-handed weapon, then the character does not gain the buckler's bonus to AC until the start of their next turn. Attacking with a one-handed weapon or thrown weapon using the buckler hand causes disadvantage on the attack roll. The hand wielding the buckler does not count as a free hand for the purposes of spellcasting, grappling, or unarmed attacks. A character proficient with shields is also considered proficient with bucklers. A buckler does not benefit from the rules or abilities that specifically refer to shields, such as the Protection Fighting Style or the Shield Master feat.

**Tower Shield**: A huge metal-reinforced shield nearly as tall as its wielder. Donning and doffing the tower shield takes 1 action. A character cannot benefit from a tower shield and any other type of shield at the same time. While a tower shield is equipped, its bearer takes disadvantage on all attack rolls due to the off-balancing encumbrance of the shield, unless the weapon has the Light property. A character proficient with both shields and heavy armor is assumed to be proficient with tower shields. All other rules that affect shields still apply to tower shields.
Lorica Squamata
Medium armor
Description: Lorica squamata consists of a metal scale shirt fitted with steel shoulders, like those found on lorica segmentata. Used by standard bearers, musicians, centurions, and cavalry troops, lorica squamata is common within the legions of Coryan, even finding its way to some auxiliary infantry legions as well.

Milandisian Andrean Suit of Plate Heavy armor
Description: Named for Andreas II, former king of Milandir and creator of this style of armor, Andrean plate offers the greatest protection achieved to date. Though it is far too heavy for all but the strongest knights to wear, Andrean plate is surprisingly easy to move around in. Its clever design permits the wearer to enjoy almost a full range of motion. This armor is rare, not because its construction is controlled, but because it is extremely expensive to manufacture. Only the wealthiest of individuals can afford such a suit of armor.

Milandisian Gothic Cuirass Heavy armor
Description: Milandisian armor smiths are some of the most accomplished in the history of the craft. One of their many innovations is the Milandisian cuirass, which increases the effectiveness of the typical horseman’s cuirass by adding a series of cunningly designed curves to the breastplate and helm.


Ss’ressen Scale Armor
Light armor
Description: This heavy coat and skirt of scaled leather is made from the hides of the huge ss’ressen of the Agamassi egg clutch. This extremely rare armor may only be found in Altheria or the eloran city of Entaris. It is an accepted fact that the elorii were the originators of this type of armor, and they have several suits of ss’ressen scale dating back to time of the eloran hegemony over the continent.
Special: If you are a ss’ressen with the Natural Armor racial ability, they gain a +1 bonus to your AC while wearing this armor.

### Weapons




**Penetrating:** Some ranged weapons are particularly effective against armored opponents at close range. Weapons with the penetrating property grant advantage on attack rolls when used against armored opponents within 15 feet. This ability is ineffective against abilities that increase AC but are not armor such as the monk’s Unarmored Defense.

**Versatile Damage:** Weapons with this quality have both a primary and a secondary damage type. Your weapon will always do the primary damage type unless you declare otherwise before you roll damage.

**Worn:** Worn weapons augment your unarmed attack damage and may not be disarmed. Putting on or removing a worn weapon takes an action.

Cestus: Popular in the arenas and tavernas of 
Coryan, this reinforced leather glove consists of 
a series of leather thongs that are tied over the 
hand; the thongs secure a set of metal plates, 
one over the knuckles and the other along the 
back of the hand. 
There are two variants of this 
weapon. The myrmex "limb-piercer" 
has the versatile damage (piercing) 
property and the sphairai "bone-
breaker" has the versatile damage 
(slashing) property.

*** On a hit with this weapon, the wielder can forgo dealing damage and attempt to trip the target, in which case the target must succeed on a Strength saving throw or fall prone. The DC is 8 + the wielder's Strength modifier + the wielder's proficiency bonus.

**** This weapon is similar to a light crossbow except that it has half the range (40/160 feet) and doesn't have the loading property. It automatically reloads after firing until it runs out of ammunition. Reloading the cartridge takes an action.

Weapon: Like Sarishan steel weapons, weapons made of tempered Sarishan steel are considered to be magical weapons for the purposes of bypassing the damage resistance of infernals, but unlike Sarishan steel weapons, weapons made of tempered Sarishan steel deal an additional 1d6 damage of the weapon’s type when dealing damage to infernals.
If a tempered Sarishan steel weapon is used while smiting an infernal either using a smite spell or the Smite class feature, this weapon deals an additional 1d10 damage instead.

### About Worn Weapons
You can use weapons you wear on your body, (worn weapons), to make unarmed strikes. When you make an unarmed strike while wearing a worn weapon, you deal the weapon’s damage instead of your normal unarmed strike damage. You must able to use the part of your body where the weapon is attached to make the unarmed strike. You cannot use a cestus to make an unarmed strike if you are using that hand to wield a 
sword or hold a lantern. For example, when you attack with a cestus, your unarmed strike deals 1d4 + your Strength modifier bludgeoning damage, assuming you use the fist wearing the cestus to make that unarmed strike. 
Worn weapons do allow you to benefit from runes and other magical effects that can be applied to weapons.Any rune or spell that would affect a weapon can be applied to a worn weapon, and the rune or effect applies to your unarmed strikes.


Simple Weapons  
Weapons with special rules are described here, as well as the weapons unique to Arcanis.


Flintlocks: Altheria may be a center of knowledge and learning, but it is the power of blastpowder that has kept the Republic of Altheria safe for many years. The Altherians’ advanced understanding of blastpowder and its explosive potential has aided them in the design of their flintlock weapons. 
Altherian flintlocks are designed to take advantage of specific amounts of blastpowder for every shot, leading to the creation of blastpowder rounds – small paper or cloth packets of blastpowder pre-measured to gain the most efficient and accurate shot. Therefore, these fine weapons are usually easier, safer, and faster to reload and fire.

Altherians, as well as clerics and holy champions of Althares, may purchase flintlocks at the listed price and may carry them regardless of rank.
You do not suffer penalties for firing a flintlock while prone. Unless you have a flintlock maintenance kit and are proficient with it, whenever you roll a 1 on a ranged attack roll with a flintlock the weapon malfunctions and jams. A jammed flintlock cannot be fired. 

Repairing a jammed flintlock requires proficient use of a flintlock maintenance kit and takes 10 minutes.

Additionally, in Arcanis flintlocks are reinforced and balanced for use as improvised melee weapons. Flintlock pistols may be used as clubs, while flintlock rifles may be used as greatclubs. If you are proficient with a club or greatclub, you can add your proficiency bonus to attack rolls with your flintlock when you use it as an improvised weapon.



**Soldier’s Pack (14 gp):** Includes a backpack, a bedroll, a hammer, a mess-kit, 10 pitons, 10 torches, a tinderbox, a tent, 10 days of rations, and a waterskin. The pack also has 50 feet of hempen rope strapped to the side of it. 


### Optional Rule: Large Weapons and Armor

```
There are some Heroes who are naturally Large size, or who have the ability to increase their size and become Large.
If this occurs, you may be required to purchase weapons and armor sized for a Large creature.
Finding someone with the skill to forge Large-sized equipment is no easy task, and the equipment itself costs double its listed price. Large weapons deal an extra die of damage, so a Large longsword deals 2d8 damage. You cannot wear armor that is too small for you.
If you try to wield a weapon too big for you, you suffer disadvantage on all attack rolls with that weapon, even if you are proficient with it. If you wear armor that is too big for you, you suffer disadvantage on all Dexterity (Stealth) checks and your speed is reduced by 10, no matter your Strength.
```





Armor: A suit of scale or plate made from fervidite may look dull, but it is much lighter than a similar suit made of a different metal. Fervidite armor removes disadvantage of
Dexterity (Stealth) checks and any Strength requirement to move at full speed caused by the armor. Additionally,
Medium fervidite armor can be worn under clothing,
requiring an observer to succeed on a DC 15 Intelligence
(Investigation) check to spot the armor.
Weapon: Weapons and ammunition made from
fervidite have 50 extra hit points and are considered to be 
217 Arcanis 5e • Chapter 4: Equipment
both adamantine and silver for the purpose of bypassing
damage resistances and immunities, or triggering damage
vulnerabilities. Fervidite can be used to either forge the
blade of a weapon like a sword or it can be used to add
studs and tracings to a weapon like a quarterstaff.
Due to the strength of the metal, ammunition made
from fervidite generally does not break when fired. At the
end of combat, you can recover all expended ammunition
made from fervidite, unless the GM says otherwise. 
\




Armor: While you are wearing a suit of adamantine
armor, anytime you are hit with a critical strike the attack
becomes a normal hit and the armor takes a permanent and
cumulative -1 penalty to AC. Adamantine armor reduced
to AC 10 is destroyed. Some smiths can repair adamantine
armor, but the process is expensive and time consuming.
Usually, it costs half the total purchase cost to repair
adamantine armor.
Weapon: Weapons made of adamantine are virtually
unbreakable and have resistance to all slashing, piercing,
and bludgeoning damage. Some creatures, usually
constructs, have resistances that can only be bypassed by
adamantine weapons.


Weapon: Any weapon made of Sarishan steel is
considered to be a magical weapon for the purposes of
bypassing the damage resistance of infernals. Sarishan
steel can be used to either forge the blade of a weapon like
a sword or it can be used to add studs and tracings to a
weapon like a quarterstaff.
Armor: While you are wearing armor made of Sarishan
steel, damage taken from an infernal’s melee attacks or
special traits that deal damage is reduced by 1. Only armor
primarily made of metal can be made from Sarishan steel.
Shield: While you are wielding a shield made of Sarishan
steel, when you are targeted by an infernal with a spell or
special trait that deals damage, as a reaction you can apply
your shield’s AC bonus to your saving throw against the
triggering effect

Weapon: A weapon crafted primarily of metal can be
made of glass steel. Such weapons weigh half as much as a
normal. Any one-handed sword, such as a longsword, made
from glass steel gains the light or finesse weapon quality,
chosen during construction.
Shields: A shield forged from glass steel weighs only 3 lbs.

# Elixirs, oils, salves

Draught of the Saddle Born
Potion, rare
Description: This liquid has the thick consistency of syrup and is white in color.
History: Though shunned by their fellow tribesman, Ehtzara are still sought out from time to time by an ambitious chieftain or budding warrior for items of power. One common request is for a Jihuk-Za, or, roughly translated, a “draught of the saddle born”. These potions are reputed to give the imbiber power over equines and grant a warrior uncanny control of their mount. Ehtzara brew these elixirs from mare’s milk and the sap from certain cacti, the identity of which is kept a closely guarded secret.
Abilities/Effects: When you drink this potion you gain the ability to speak with all manner of equine animals for 4 hours and have advantage on all Wisdom (Animal Handling) checks dealing with equines.
Elixir of Longevity
Potion, legendary
Description: The liquid of this potion is clear with a slight yellowish tint. 
History: This elixir was used exclusively by the ssanu nobles of Yahssremore during the years before the elorii slave revolt. Brewed from blending the tears of the immortal elorii, extracted through unspeakable tortures, along with the venom of a rare and deadly asp, this elixir grants its imbiber an unnaturally extended life.
Abilities/Effects: Once you drink this potion you must make a DC 25 Constitution saving throw. If you succeed your natural lifespan is doubled; if you fail, you die instantly. This potion may be used multiple times, but each dose requires a new Constitution saving throw. This potion has no effect if you are immortal.
Elixir of Red Fury
Potion, rare
Description: This blood red potion bubbles and swirls as if the very liquid were angered.
History: First created by the Temple of Hurrian, there is also a version of this potion available from the Temple of Nier.
Abilities/Effects: Drinking this potion causes you to fly into furious rage for 1 minute, granting a +2 bonus to melee damage as well as gaining advantage on Strength ability checks and Strength saving throws. During this red rage, you are unable to cast or concentrate on spells. You may not end the rage until the potion runs its course.
Elixir of Skins
Potion, rare
Description: Brewed from a combination of blood, broth, and marrow from an appropriate beast, this brownish mixture is then poured into a wooden flask carved in the creature’s likeliness.
History: This elixir was once the province of the Pengik tribes of the Pricklespur Forest, but years of trading with the neighboring Yhing hir has made this unique brew available to the shaman of the horsemen.
Abilities/Effects: Each elixir of skins is made with materials from a specific creature of CR 2 or less. For 4 hours after imbibing this elixir, you may, as a bonus action, Wild Shape into the creature the elixir was made from.
 
You may only use this ability once and you can remain transformed for up to one hour. If you are a druid, you gain all of the Wild Shape benefits imparted by your Circle (if any).
Elixir of the Oracle
Potion, very rare
Description: This elixir has a slightly rosy tint, though the faint specs suspended in the liquid reflect a gold and silvery shine.
History: This elixir is brewed only by the most talented of Larissan Oracles, and then only when they feel it is necessary to grant individuals visions of their own future. When imbibed, this elixir grants the user an answer to a question regarding the future of a person, place, or object.
Abilities/Effects: When drinking this potion, you instantly fall into a deep trance for 1 minute, during which you are overwhelmed by visions of the future. These take the form of a flood of pictures, sounds, and emotions. You may attempt a DC 15 Wisdom (Insight) check to determine a general emotion connected to the visions (fear, disgust, anguish, distrust, or pleasure, for example).
At the GM’s discretion, you may attempt an Intelligence (Investigation) check to recall specific details of the vision at a later date. The exact nature of the vision is up to the GM, but this potion can be used as a vehicle to foreshadow important campaign events.
Elixir of the Valinor’s Heart
Potion, very rare
Description: This ornate crystal vial contains a viscous red fluid.
History: Said to have been created by the val’Mehan family during the ancient Blood Wars, the formula for creating this potion was discovered by the Emerald Society during an expedition in the Blessed Lands. Since creating one draught of this elixir requires the complete exsanguination of a val, it was considered too dangerous for public consumption and so consigned to the Vaults of Forbidden Knowledge in New Althre’. Nevertheless, the formula made its way into grimoires of various black sorcerers, witches and unscrupulous Sarishans across the Known Lands.
Abilities/Effects: This elixir grants the drinker the bloodline abilities of a single val family, with the specific powers being dictated by which val was used to create the elixir. For 1 hour after imbibing this elixir, you gain one of the following benefits as appropriate: 
If you are a val of the same bloodline as the elixir, your Blood Rank is increased by 2 and you gain the corresponding benefits (attack bonus, save DC increase, additional powers, uses per day), though you gain no additional bloodline powers.
If you are a val of a different bloodline from the elixir, you suppress your own powers and replace them with powers chosen from the potion’s bloodline. You may only access a number of bloodline powers equal to those you already have (for example, if you have 3 val bloodline powers presently, you may only access 3 bloodline powers of equivalent level of the val bloodline of the elixir).
If you are not a val you gain no benefits from this elixir, and instead suffer 4d10 poison damage and are poisoned for 1 hour.
Fury Elixir
Potion, uncommon
Description: This milky mixture is usually contained in a metal flask, which bubbles and sizzles when unstopped.
History: First gaining popularity in the gladiatorial arenas of Sicaris, Eppion, and Plexus, the elixir was a closely guarded secret as use of magical or alchemical enhancements are frowned upon. It remained so until the funerary games of the Emperor Calcestus val’Assante. There, a second-rate gladiator butchered a very skilled and favorite fighter of the new emperor. After an investigation, the gladiator confessed to taking the concoction and soon thereafter use of the fury elixir has been prohibited. Even though the elixir blesses the user with greatly enhanced physical attributes and the ability to ignore pain, it later ravages the mind and body leaving many a gladiator an empty husk.

Potion, very rare
Description: Requiring a lengthy Beltinian prayer over a flask of ectoplasm residue from a forcefully dissipated spirit or shade, the ghoststep draught is one of the rarest and most difficult potions to produce.
History: Believed known only to the Beltinian high priests for use in their most sacred rituals travelers to the Hinterlands have witnessed the Ehtzara use a similar potion to achieve the same results. Scholars are unsure if this is merely a product of parallel development or if there is some heretofore unknown link between the Beltinians and these erratic shamans.

Potion, rare

The tribe’s witch doctor prepares the draught from sacred peppers, a fresh kill and invocations to the spirit of the fearsome striped hunter that stalks the land.

Far ranging Chauni and Dailish pirates have managed to acquire the recipe and have sold it to alchemists and scholars across the Known Lands.

Mindfire
Potion, very rare
Description: This clear liquid tastes sweet and produces a pleasant tingling to the user’s lips.
History: This potion is brewed from the crushed petals of the rare prince’s flower and has become quite popular among scribes and sages thought the Known Lands. Though its benefits are tangible, it takes a terrible toll upon the body. What some imbibers feel is even worse is that prince’s flower is only found upon the Isle of Tears, the home of the dreaded Sorcerer-King and his Harvesters. Originally created by the Ymandrake Wine Drinkers, they often demand payment in the form of information on the whereabouts of arcane spellcasters in exchange for another vial.

Oil of Beast Repulsion
Potion, rare
Description: This murky liquid has an unexpectedly floral scent, and is applied topically. If ingested, it acts as a mild poison, inducing violent vomiting for ld4 hours.

Beasts that fail their save remain frightened as long as they can see you and must move to the nearest safe spot where they cannot see you.
If they then come back within 30 feet of you, they may make a new saving throw. Once a beast succeeds on their saving throw, they are unaffected by the oil for its duration. Creatures that cannot smell automatically succeed on their saving throw.
 
Oil of Deflection
Potion, rare
Description: Stored in a hinged shell of a small turtle, this salve is created from a mixture of herbs and a pungent mold that grows deep within swamps and marshes. Rumors persist of additional, if less savory, ingredients but what these are is something that the ss’ressen priestesses are unwilling to share. After letting the concoction cool after boiling, it creates a smelly paste that is applied by smearing it over the user’s body.
History: Crafted by specially trained ss’ressen priestesses, the salve is used to provide ss’ressen warriors with an equal footing against the heavier armored humans of Milandir and Coryan.
Abilities/Effects: Each shell holds 3 applications of oil of deflection. Each application covers a Medium or smaller creature. Applying this oil takes 1 minute, but once applied, you gain a +1 bonus to your AC for the next hour.
Oil of Puissance
Potion, rare
Description: This clear oil has a metallic smell and is brewed by priests of Nier or Hurrian.
History: This oil was first developed by Taliose val’Virdan, an alchemist in service to the Sword of the Heavens. He was later captured by rebel forces and ‘persuaded’ to reveal the formula before being buried up to his neck and left near a colony of tiger ants on the edge of the Haunted Wastes.
Abilities/Effects: You gain 10 temporary hit points and have advantage on Strength and Constitution saving throws for 1 minute.
Oil of Pyrotechnics
Potion, rare
Description: Appearing to look like common olive oil, these potions typically come in fragile ceramic or glass containers. The liquid is a highly reactive explosive, without the viscosity of alchemist’s fire. When used as a grenade-like weapon, it explodes with devastating consequences.

Abilities/Effects: As an action, you can throw this vial up to 20 feet, where it shatters on impact and the liquid within explodes on contact. Make a ranged attack against a creature or an object, 
treating the vial as an improvised weapon. Every creature in a 10-foot radius around where the vial breaks must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw. An affected creature takes 3d8 fire and 3d8 thunder damage, or half as much on a successful saving throw. This explosion is quite loud and can be clearly heard hundreds of feet away.
Oil of Scent Masking
Potion, uncommon
Description: This amber colored oil is odorless. When applied, this oil masks the scent of the wearer.
History: This oil was first discovered being used by poachers raiding the preserves of Balantica to avoid the hounds and other beasts used to safeguard the area. When questioned, the poachers couldn’t identify who sold them the oil. The ruling val’Dellenov family believes that it must have been the neighboring val’Borda family, testing the oil’s efficacy before issuing it to their spies. For their part, the scions of Cadic vehemently deny any such accusations.
Abilities/Effects: After spreading this oil upon your body, any creature who attempts to track or locate you though scent suffers disadvantage on their ability checks for the next three hours. Even if the creature normally has advantage while using scent, the power of this oil is so overpowering the creature still suffers disadvantage.
Potion of Bloodmastery
Potion, (lesser) rare; (greater) very rare
Description: This potion is dark red, almost the purple of a bruise, with a silver effervesce when unstopped.
History: Seeking a way to emulate the ability some mages wield Adkir, a member of the Ymandrake Order of Wine Drinkers, studied and experimented around the clock, much to the agony of his test subjects, until he unlocked the secret of the formulae. Through a laborious process, he was able to distill the very essence in a sorcerer’s blood that allows him to manipulate arcane power. After hurriedly preparing his first vial of it, he presented it to Order. Needless to say, his superiors were most pleased and Adkir’s worth to the Wine Drinkers soared.
Only accomplished Wine Drinkers are allowed access to the lesser bloodmastery potion and the secret of its creation, while only the highest-ranking Wine Drinkers have access to the greater bloodmastery potion. Adkir has recently perfected an even more powerful bloodmastery potion that emulates specific val family bloodline abilities, but gleefully waits to demonstrate its marvelous efficiency in a large-scale slaughter of some kind. His Order finds this amusing. The vals certainly won’t.
Abilities/Effects: When casting a spell, you may drink this potion as an additional material component. Its effects depend on the rarity of the potion. If you drink this potion and you are not a Wine Drinker, you suffer disadvantage on any saving throw against spells until the beginning of your next turn, in addition to its other effects.
Lesser bloodmastery: Your spell is cast as if you used a spell slot 1 level higher, even if you do not possess the appropriate spell slot.
Greater bloodmastery: Your spell is cast as if you used a spell slot one-level higher, even if you do not possess a higher level slot. In addition, if your target has blood or internal fluid of some kind, you have advantage on your spell attack roll and give disadvantage on your target’s saving throw against the spells effects, if any.
Potion of Mist
Potion, rare
Description: This clear viscous liquid seems to shimmer when held up to the light.
History: Commissioned by a group of thieves, the dwarven Master Alchemist Rodin, the Encali knew a great business opportunity when he saw one. He freely sold hundreds of vials of his creation to anyone who could meet his price. His monopoly was eventually broken when the formula was stolen, the robber vanishing without a trace, but for a thin trail of haze.
Abilities/Effects: You After drinking this potion, for 1 minute you may spend your reaction to surround yourself in silvery mist and teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space that you can see.
Potion of Poison Spittle
Potion, rare
Description: Swirling green fluid fills this glass phial, usually marked with a spitting asp on the side.
History: A cache of vials filled with this potion was discovered in a cave near the Canyon of Zhu. While only forty bottles of the mixture were found, others have been found in and near the Abessian Dominion throughout the years. Possession of this item is illegal in most nations of the Known Lands.
Abilities/Effects: After drinking this potion, for 1 minute you may, as a bonus action you may spit poison at a target you can see. Make a ranged attack against a creature within 30 feet, treating your poison spittle as an improvised weapon. Any creature struck suffers 3d8 poison damage and must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 hour. 
Potion of Putrescence
Potion, uncommon
Description: This vile liquid is sickly green in color and is usually held in a putrescent skin.
History: Fanatical Nerothians aspiring to one day receive the blessing of Neroth and join the ranks of undead, use this potion to emulate their betters. Once ingratiated into their court, they make themselves subservient to their undead lords, seeking guidance, tutelage, and performing tasks delegated by their masters, in the hopes of being granted life beyond life.
Abilities/Effects: Once you drink this disgusting potion, for 1 minute, any creature within 10 feet that possesses a sense of smell must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned by your noxious scent until they are more than 10 feet away from you. For the next hour, you have advantage on all Charisma checks when attempting to feign death, appearing to all as a corpse.
Potion of Satiety
Potion, rare
History: These potions can usually be acquired at shrines or temples to the goddess Anshar, especially those near the frontier, where finding fresh water and food is uncertain.
Abilities/Effects: You require neither food nor drink for 1d4 days + your Constitution modifier after drinking this potion. You suffer no ill effects of thirst or starvation during this time, even those that would be inflicted through supernatural means. You may eat and drink during this time without ill effect. Once the duration has ended, you must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or gain 2 levels of exhaustion.
If you drink this potion while you have levels of exhaustion, you immediately vomit up the potion and do not gain any of its effects.
Potion of Steely Nerves
Potion, uncommon
Description: This purple liquid is easily identified by its pungent odor and fiery taste.
 
History: First crafted by the Milandisian priests of Hurrian for those marching towards the horrors of Canceri during the Heretic War, this potion now enjoys widespread use across the Known Lands.
Abilities/Effects: For 1 hour after imbibing this potion, you have advantage on all saving throws against any effect that would make you frightened.
Potion of Uncanny Alertness
Potion, rare
Description: This potion at first appears colorless but when held in the sunlight it is revealed to have a faint blue tint.
History: Used by explorers of the Emerald Society when delving into ancient catacombs or in the pervasive lightless caverns of the Endless Dark, this potion has saved many lives by revealing chasms and dead drops that would have otherwise been invisible.
imbibing this potion, you have advantage on all Wisdom (Perception) checks and your passive Perception increases by +5. Unfortunately, your increased sensitivity of vision and hearing makes you vulnerable to bright lights and loud sounds, giving you disadvantage on saving throws against light or sound based attacks during the duration of the potion.
Potion, uncommon
Description: These oils were once stored in glass upon which were inscribed prayers and benedictions of the various Gods. During the Fifth Crusade, common tin flasks were used and reused due to the King’s orders to produce large quantities of the oil.
History: Once a rare commodity and given sparingly to only the most pious and worthy, sanctified oils were produced in large quantities by order of King Osric during the Fifth Crusade of Light. So commonplace were these sacred oils that the soldiers began to irreverently calling it, “the Gods’ spit”. With their stores of ingredients depleted, temple priests were unable to produce the quantities demanded of them twenty years later at the inception of the Sixth Crusade of Light, leading to a higher mortality rate among the rank and file in their battles against Infernals.
Abilities/Effects: As an action you may apply this oil on a non-magical weapon, shield or suit of armor. If applied to a weapon, the weapon becomes temporarily magical, 
granting a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls with that weapon. If applied to a shield or armor, it grants a +1 bonus to AC while wearing the armor or holding the shield. This effect lasts for 1 hour.
Voei Skin Salve
Potion, very rare
Description: This clay jar contains a brownish-green liquid with the viscosity of syrup. When applied to the bare skin, flesh takes on a thick and warty quality, darkening slightly, and giving off a cinnamon aroma.
History: The formula for this noxious salve was discovered by Calyce val’Dellenov during an expedition to the Fervidus Hills. Her party of explorers came across the deserted encampment of a tribe of savage Voei. While the rest of the expedition sifted for rare Voei artifacts, Calyce stumbled upon the dwelling of the tribe’s witchdoctor. Among the many strange items in the hut, she came across a sample of a strange salve. When applied to the skin, the flesh becomes hard and warty, taking on a brown tinge and making it resistant to many types of harm.
After years of experimentation mostly on herself, Calyce was able to replicate the recipe and manufacture more of the paste. Unfortunately, Calyce also learned that the salve has an addictive quality to it, until eventually, the being that was Calyce val’Dellenov was cornered and incinerated, ending her homicidal rampage throughout the streets of Old Coryan.
Abilities/Effects: You cannot apply this paste if you have levels of exhaustion. Once applied, the paste remains active for 1 hour. While active, you heal 10 hit points of damage at the beginning of your turn. This healing is suppressed for 1 round if you suffer acid or fire damage.
If you are reduced to 0 hit points while under the effects of this potion, you automatically succeed on all death saving throws, and begin to regain hit points after your third death save. If you suffer acid or fire damage while below 0 hit points, you automatically fail your death saving throws as normal for suffering damage while unconscious.
After this paste wears off, you gain 1 level of exhaustion.
War Paints of the Skohir
Potion, very rare
Description: These body paints are fashioned by Skohir shamans from the paste made from red seaweed found in the shallows of islands known only to them. This paste is mixed during a complex ritual while with various herbs, roots and seeds to create pastes of different colors and textures, while appealing to various spirits to empower the mixiuie.
History: Used by the Skohir during raids or for rare standing battles against rival Yhing-hir tribes or Milandisians, it makes these formidable warriors even more deadly and fearsome.

For 1 hour, these pigments protect you, granting an AC of 14 + your Dexterity modifier. In addition, the war paint grants different effects depending upon the type of pigment applied.
Red war paint gives advantage on Strength and Dexterity saving throws
Blue gives advantage on Intelligence and Wisdom saving throws
Violet affords a +1d4 bonus to all weapon damage rolls.
Black grants the ability to take the Hide action as a bonus action on your turn as well as the benefits of the pass without trace spell (self-only, no concentration required).


# Mastercraft Items

## Mastercraft Items 

A mastercraft item is an item created with such skill and care that it is clearly superior to a normal item. Not just any craftsmen can create a mastercraft item; only an expert in his or her craft, with exceptional skill and years of experience, can create such an item. Mastercraft items can take the form of weapons, armor, or tools. All mastercraft items are exceptionally durable and can take wear and tear better than a normal item. Although mastercraft items are not magical, magic items are mastercraft items, but their magical description and properties replaces any benefit they grant from being mastercraft. 

### Mastercraft weapons 

Mastercraft weapons are particularly sharp and sturdy. You gain a +1 bonus to damage rolls made with a mastercraft weapon. Your weapon is less likely to break under normal use. Ammunition generally cannot be mastercrafted. If a mastercraft weapon gains a bonus to damage from any other source, that bonus replaces the bonus granted from the weapon being a mastercraft weapon. Mastercraft weapons cost 300 GPs more than the base price of the weapon. A mastercraft weapon can also be silvered, but this costs an additional 100 GPs. 

### Mastercraft Armor 

Mastercraft armor and shields provide the same protection as their normal counterparts but weigh less. Mastercraft light armor, medium armor, and shields weigh half as much as normal. Mastercraft heavy armor weighs three-quarters as much as normal. The strength score required to wear mastercraft heavy armor before one's speed is reduced is one point less than the listed score. Mastercraft armor and shields are less likely to break under normal use. They cost twice as much as their normal counterparts. 

### Mastercraft Tools 

Mastercraft tools are created with such quality that they make it easier for you to use them. You gain a +1 bonus to any check you make with a mastercraft tool with which you are proficient. They are more durable under normal use. Mastercraft tools cost four times as much as their normal counterparts.

# Rare materials

Material/Treatment Cost Adamantine 428 gp per lb Adamant x gp Arandur x gp Darksteel x gp Dlarun x gp Dragonhide x gp Gold 50 gp per lb Mithral 210 gp per lb Silver 5 gp per lb Telstang x gp Blueshine x gp Everbright x gp Halabar's Stealth x gp

Hides & Leathers Dragon Leather: Armor \(leather, studded leather, scale mail, hide\): The powerful virtues of dragon's hide can be invested into suits of armor made of the material by cunning craftsmen. When you're wearing armor made from it, you reduce the damage taken from slashing and piercing injuries by 1. You additionally reduce damage taken from a single damage type that corresponds with the original dragon's breath weapon by 1 \(fire for red dragons, lightning for blue, etc\). Wearers are warned, however, that dragons do take ill to those they encounter wearing this. Metals Adamantine: An alloy of adamant, silver, and electrum, or of steel and mithral, it is black in color, with a green sheen in candlelight or a purple-white light in magical radiance. Armor \(Chain shirt, scale mail, breastplate, half plate; ring mail, chain mail, splint, plate\): Adamant makes armor of exquisite diamond-hard substance. While you're wearing it, any critical hit against you becomes a normal hit. Weapons: Though adamantine weapons have no additional properties, adamantine takes and holds magic quite well. Many magical weapons are wrought of adamantine because of this. Adamant: A gleaming, glossy black refinement of adamantine, a natural jet-black ferromagnetic ore found in obsidian beds. It is gleaming, glossy black, with a rainbow sheen in bright light. It is too brittle to make keen weapons from, but is a favorite of dwarf-folk for hammers. Armor \(Chain shirt, scale mail, ring mail, chain mail, splint\): Though this jet black metal is too fragile to form actual armor, strips of it can be used to reinforce flexible armors. It strengthens the armor minutely, but its main property is to partially absorb fire. You reduce all slashing damage by 1, and all fire damage by 1d6. In any combat in which you take bludgeoning damage, however, roll a d20 at the end of the combat. If you roll a 9 or lower, the strips of adamant have been shattered and will need to be repaired \(which costs 20% of the cost to install the reinforcements\) by a smith skilled in the working of adamant. Until repairs are done, you lose all benefits of this material. Weapons \(bludgeoning\): When you have advantage on an attack roll, if the lower of the two dice would also hit your target's AC, you inflict an additional d4 damage. Arandur: Once the exclusive secret of the gnome-kind, arandur is a gleaming silver-blue metal, with a green reflective sheen in sunlight. It also naturally absorbs the magical injuries used to inflict raw kinetic injuries. Armor \(scale mail, breastplate, half plate; splint, plate; shield\): When used to make non-flexible metal armors, arandur grants its wearer the ability to reduce force damage by 2. Weapons \(slashing or piercing\): Arandur can be honed to wicked edges that are not easily dulled. When you inflict a critical with a slashing or piercing weapons wrought of arandur, add your Proficiency bonus to the final damage total. Darksteel: A silvery metal with a shadowed cast that gleams purple-ish in firelight, darksteel's making is lost today, an ancient secret of teh Ironstar clan of dwarves. Smiths throughout the Realms offer great amounts of gold for the recovery of any lost ingots of the metal. Armor \(Chain shirt, scale mail, breastplate, half plate; ring mail, chain mail, splint, plate\): Armor wrought of darksteel reduces all bludgeoning and lightning damage inflicted to the wearer by 1. Dlarun: A little known halfling metal dug up from clumps of river clay and then kilned at high temperatures, dlarun is a bone-white metal that can take a high polish, and gains a distinctive greenish sheen under magical lighting. It has the strange benefit of steadying the minds of those that wear it. Armor \(Studded leather; breastplate, half plate; splint, plate; shield\): Armor wrought of dlarun reduces all bludgeoning and psychic damage by 1, and grants a +1 to saves against all Enchantment spells. Gold: Though quite precious, gold is still considered one of the "common metals." Gold is aligned with solar and celestial magics, purifying undeath. Gold continually flakes and chips away, however, necessitating constant \(although simple\) repairs. Armor \(any\): Though gold is too soft to make armor from, while wearing gold-filigreed armor, reduce all necrotic damage taken by 1. For each item of armor possessed and used, add the following costs to your Lifestyle expenditures per month: 1sp for light armor or shield, 5sp for medium armor, 1gp for heavy armor. Weapon \(any\): Gold-filigreed weapons used to strike the undead inflict 1 additional point of radiant damage. For each such weapon, add 2sp to your Lifestyle cost expenditures per month. Mithral: Called the "truemetal" by dwarf-folk, mithral is derived from soft, glittering, silvery-black ore found in rare veins and pockets from the depths of the Underdark to surface rocks. Armor \(chain shirt, scale mail, breastplate, half plate; ring mail, chain mail, splint, plate; shield\): Mithral lends subtlety and grace to the wearer. If the armor normally inflicts disadvantage on Stealth rolls, that property is negated. If it does not, then the armor can be worn normally under clothes without giving away the fact that the wearer is wearing armor. Weapons \(slashing or piercing\): The fine edge of mithral is sung about in elven ballads, and with good reason. When you have advantage on an attack roll, if the lower of the two dice would also hit your target's AC, you inflict an additional d4 damage. Silver: Another common metal, silver is aligned with the powers and mysteries of Selûne. Weapon \(any\): Many creatures take grievous wounds from silvered weapons. Though the metal is too soft and costly to make weapons from directly, weapons can easily be silvered with the stuff, granting the property of the metal without taking away from its utility. Telstang: Originally a gnomish secret, this alloy of copper, mithral, platinum, and silver is a dull pewter-silver in hue, and gives off a clear bell-like tone when struck with another metal \(leading to its other name of "singing metal"\). It also collects and reverberates sudden sonic assaults outward away from itself. Armor \(Scale mail, breastplate, half plate; splint, plate\): Though telstang's construction make it largely unsuitable for armors, some craft them anyway for its two tremendous benefits. The first is that any sonic damage taken by the wearer is reduced by 1d6 points. The second is that the wearer automatically succeeds at any saving throws that paralyze or change his shape. Any critical hit with bludgeoning or force damage shatters your armor, however \(though this critical hit only inflicts normal damage instead of doubling it\). Metal Treatments These are alchemical and metallurgical treatments used to treat specific kinds of metals.

Blueshine: Metal weapons and armor. A treatment that gives a bluish sheen to any items wrought of iron, steel, adamantine, arandur, darksteel, mithral, silver, or telstang, blueshine helps negate caustic substances. The metal part of weapons coated in the stuff become immune to acid damage, and armors coated in it grant resistance to acid damage: reduce all acid damage taken by 1 for medium armors or 2 for heavy armors. Everbright: Metal weapons and armor. A dwarven process now known to smiths of many folk, everbright-treated items gleam with a mirror finish \(like a chromium finish\). Metal objects \(which can only be made of steel, adamantine, or mithral\) treated with everbright are immune to rust and the passage of time, and those wearing armor or bearing shields treated with it reduce radiant damage taken by 1 for medium armors and shields or 2 for heavy armors. Remaining unseen while wearing such armor is quite difficult, however; those searching visually for everbright-clad characters gain advantage on their checks to spot them. Halabar's Stealth: Metal weapons and armor. An expensive but increasingly common metal treatment that renders metallic weapons and armor nonferromagnetic, nonreflective, and wholly silent, not even clanging when struck against other metals or stone. Drawing or wielding such weapons will not reveal a hidden character, and metal armor wrought of it does not inflict disadvantage on Stealth checks.
