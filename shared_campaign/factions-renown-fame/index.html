<p>Disfavor with a faction imposes disadvantage on all Charisma (Persuasion) and Charisma (Intimidate) skill checks made with that faction. In the case of Favors with large groups, you only gain this penalty when interacting with those of high station such as a general, a king, or the patriarch of a patrician family associated with that power.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You may use a Favor to cancel a Disfavor from the same faction. This voids both the Favor and Disfavor immediately.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You may spend a Favor with a given faction/group/individual (at GM’s discussion) to gain the benefits of a one-time expenditure of 3 fame with that faction/group/individual. You may spend two favors with the same factionBto gain the benefits of a 5-point fame expenditure.</p>

Mulmaster. You maintain law and order through
intimidation and strongarm tactics. You can

madness or long-term madness that afflicts you.

downtime days, you can rally three bandits and

and you do not already have these allies (and
have not already called them during the current
adventure), you can use a bonus action to
spend an additional five downtime days (for a
total of fifteen or twenty downtime days) and
have these allies immediately show up in a
place of the Dungeon Master’s choosing.

Underdark, you are in a perfect position to profit.
While you adventure, you are able collect
valuables without the other party members’
knowledge, then sell those valuables at a later
