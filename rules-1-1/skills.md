## Local Lore 

The\[b\] Local Lore \[/b\] Skill represents a character's knowledge of local politics, folklore, laws, and rumors. Characters are considered proficient in any intelligence roll to remember information about their kingdom or region. In addition, they have expertise on any roll concerning information about their city of origin or local province.

Example: Buckthorn BeyWinn is a forest gnome who was born in Rosebriar, a village located in the Duchy of Carmathan in Damara. Since Damara is located in the Cold Lands \(Bloodstone Lands\), Buckthorn knows the regional language of Chardic in addition to the language of the gnomes \(Gnim\), and Common. He has the secondary skill of Local Lore \(Damara\). If he tries to remember something about Carmathan or Rosebriar, he has expertise \(doubling the proficiency bonus\) on that roll.
