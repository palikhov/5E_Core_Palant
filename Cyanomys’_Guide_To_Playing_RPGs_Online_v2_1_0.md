# Cyanomys‚Äô Guide To Playing RPGs Online v2.1.0

## Hey everyone. Just letting you know that I‚Äôm going to open up this guide to whoever wants to take ownership and bring it up to date, put it on a wiki, etc. I‚Äôm willing to be involved with this project in an auxiliary role but I just can‚Äôt be the sole executor anymore, I do not have the time or expertise to move it somewhere less shitty than this. Not to mention, I just don‚Äôt play D&D anymore, which many VTTs are aimed at (I have sold my soul to Fate) so this feels much less personally relevant to me. Discord me at Cyanomys#0001 if you would like access to this document for the purposes of moving it (I have a less slow copy). You can also reddit DM me at cyanomys or email me at cyanomys@gmail.com, tho I check those much less frequently. (Cyanomys, Mar 31, 2021) 

Also I requested a miraheze domain if anyone wants to work with that: [https://vttguide.miraheze.org/](https://vttguide.miraheze.org/)

~~**Hey guys I‚Äôm not dead! I just graduated with my BS in Psychology and I have nothing but time.  This document is too slow to continue to edit so I‚Äôm going to move it to github, I think. Once I get it moved to a new platform I plan to designate some more editors besides myself so we can keep this more up to date. I‚Äôll update here when it‚Äôs done! (Cyanomys, Jan 11, 2021)**~~

# Introduction

Welcome to the new version of ‚ÄúComparison of Alternatives to Roll20‚Äù!  As of April 12, 2020 I have renamed the document and completely revamped it in response to the new surge in VTT usage due to COVID-19.  In response to great demand I am now including Roll20 in this list.  Also, I‚Äôve moved this from Google Docs to Dropbox Paper, which is better suited to very large documents and allows people to comment without being able to accidentally add suggestions. 

**Please share the document with as many people as you can**.  I did all this work because I know people need the resources right now and I want to help as many people as I can to continue to play games together during this dark time.

## Follow Updates

This is a work in progress, so I will be maintaining a changelog at the end. If you want to be notified of changes, you can  [sign up for the email list here](https://forms.gle/WjoFuMRTtrdSxkJJ8), or if you are signed into dropbox, click the three dots menu in the top right, and select ‚ÄúFollow‚Äù (though be prepared for the latter method to send you a bunch of emails when I make changes or comments.)

# Quick Start

**If you want to jump straight to the whole guide, just click the little arrow next to this section‚Äôs title to collapse it.** 
This is a very lengthy guide, hopefully so that you can compare and contrast your options and make the decision that‚Äôs right for your group. However, you may not want to spend the time thinking about that.  So, assuming you trust me üòâ, here my software recommendations for different situations.  I‚Äôm giving a couple recommendations for each group, ordering them from top to bottom in each category according to which ones seem to fit the situation best.  I‚Äôve recommended multiple VTTs alongside standalone features in each category, it‚Äôs up to you to decide which categories are most important and if you want to choose an all-in-one tool or not.

## Your casual D&D 5e group needs to get online with as little fuss as possible.

**A/V Conferencing & Chat** 

1. [Discord](https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/Cyanomys-Guide-To-Playing-RPGs-Online-v2.0-Ef83ststlhPqW0LELrgye#:h2=Discord) ‚Äî free, less good for bad internet, great group text chat servers
2. [Zoom](https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/Cyanomys-Guide-To-Playing-RPGs-Online-v2.0-Ef83ststlhPqW0LELrgye#:h2=Zoom) ‚Äî $14/mo, better for bad internet, mediocre group text chat

**Full VTT** (All in one program)

1. [Tableplop](https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/Cyanomys-Guide-To-Playing-RPGs-Online-v2.0-Ef83ststlhPqW0LELrgye#:h2=Tableplop) ‚Äî super simple, supports *both* drawing maps and importing them, Simple Fog of War, easy dice rolling, basic characters. But it‚Äôs new on the market and therefore reliability is unknown.
2. [Astral](https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/Cyanomys-Guide-To-Playing-RPGs-Online-v2.0-Ef83ststlhPqW0LELrgye#:h2=Astral-Tabletop) ‚Äî intuitive UI, easy-to-understand character sheets, fancy map features, supports *only* importing or building maps from assets, RTS-style Fog of War only, well-supported long-term by developer
3. [Roll20](https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/Cyanomys-Guide-To-Playing-RPGs-Online-v2.0.1--AyEXvlfVpkdXnBYWf1NylPF7Ag-Ef83ststlhPqW0LELrgye#:h2=Roll20) ‚Äî Roll20 is not the most intuitive or user-friendly option on the block anymore, but it has a good feature set, and it‚Äôs more prepared to deal with the huge influx of users due to the pandemic than the other two.

**A La Carte** (Use individual tools)
Syncing Battlemaps:

- [Shmeppy](https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/Cyanomys-Guide-To-Playing-RPGs-Online-v2.0-Ef83ststlhPqW0LELrgye#:h2=Shmeppy) ‚Äî super simple, supports drawing maps only, tokens, Simple Fog of War, well-supported long-term by developer

Character Sheets:

1. Dead trees ‚Äî just keep your old character sheets.
2. [PDF sharing](https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/Cyanomys-Guide-To-Playing-RPGs-Online-v2.0-Ef83ststlhPqW0LELrgye#:h2=Shared-PDFs) or [Google Sheets](https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/Cyanomys-Guide-To-Playing-RPGs-Online-v2.0-Ef83ststlhPqW0LELrgye#:h2=Google-Sheets) ‚Äî like having a paper character sheet but putting it on the internet, sometimes with nice autocalculation features
3. [D&D Beyond](https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/Cyanomys-Guide-To-Playing-RPGs-Online-v2.1.0--AyVHhmgvay5kAoffYZ82YExiAg-Ef83ststlhPqW0LELrgye#:h2=DnD-Beyond) ‚Äî D&D Beyond has gorgeous character sheets and character building, but it‚Äôs not super house-rules friendly.

Rolling Dice:

1. Physical dice with honor system.
2. [Teal 3D dice room](http://a.teall.info/mdice/).

**Rules Reference** 

1. [D&D Beyond](https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/Cyanomys-Guide-To-Playing-RPGs-Online-v2.1.0--AyVHhmgvay5kAoffYZ82YExiAg-Ef83ststlhPqW0LELrgye#:h2=DnD-Beyond) ‚Äî This is an amazing option if the poeple in your group who don‚Äôt already own all the books want to pitch in; not so awesome if you already bought all the books and now your group expects you to buy them on D&D Beyond for them to use. Also if you play West Marches this is probably not going to work for your whole group.
2. [Dungeon Master‚Äôs Vault](https://www.dungeonmastersvault.com/) ‚Äî SRD only.
3. PDFs that absolutely do not exist


## You primarily play WotC adventures.
1. [Roll20](https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/Cyanomys-Guide-To-Playing-RPGs-Online-v2.0-Ef83ststlhPqW0LELrgye#:h2=Roll20) ‚Äî easy to use with almost every adventure ready for purchase with all the work done for you
2. [Fantasy Grounds](https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/Cyanomys-Guide-To-Playing-RPGs-Online-v2.0-Ef83ststlhPqW0LELrgye#:h2=Fantasy-Grounds) ‚Äî unintuitive interface, but even more heavy lifting is done with the adventures, and they‚Äôre cheaper.


## You already invested $500 in D&D Beyond.

See the section on [D&D Beyond](https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/Cyanomys-Guide-To-Playing-RPGs-Online-v2.1.0--AyVHhmgvay5kAoffYZ82YExiAg-Ef83ststlhPqW0LELrgye#:h2=DnD-Beyond).


## You play lots of niche or indie (or just non-D&D) RPGs.

Also, if you‚Äôre interested, here‚Äôs a huge list of [Indie RPGs](http://www.flick.com/~cdr/rpg/links.html).

**Full VTT** (All in one program)

1. [Astral](https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/Cyanomys-Guide-To-Playing-RPGs-Online-v2.0-Ef83ststlhPqW0LELrgye#:h2=Astral-Tabletop) ‚Äî you can turn any PDF character sheet into a clickable, editable sheet with macros and all you need is a little elbow grease, no programming needed. A recent deal with DrivethruRPG means your DTRPG library may be available on Astral soon.
2. [Roll20](https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/Cyanomys-Guide-To-Playing-RPGs-Online-v2.0-Ef83ststlhPqW0LELrgye#:h2=Roll20) [](https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/Cyanomys-Guide-To-Playing-RPGs-Online-v2.0-Ef83ststlhPqW0LELrgye#:h2=Roll20)‚Äî if your favorite RPGs have a decent sheet already available, this is a great option. It‚Äôs not the most intuitive or user-friendly option on the block anymore, but it has a good feature set, and it‚Äôs more prepared to deal with the huge influx of users due to the pandemic than Astral.
3. [Let‚Äôs Role](https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/Cyanomys-Guide-To-Playing-RPGs-Online-v2.1.0--AyVHhmgvay5kAoffYZ82YExiAg-Ef83ststlhPqW0LELrgye#:h2=Let%E2%80%99s-Role) ‚Äî like Astral, this VTT has a custom character sheet builder and tons of cool features. The only reason it‚Äôs not higher on the list is because it‚Äôs in early access, so when you sign up you won‚Äôt immediately be given the ability to create a new game.

## You‚Äôre broke as fuck.

**A/V Conferencing & Chat** 

- [Discord](https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/Cyanomys-Guide-To-Playing-RPGs-Online-v2.0-Ef83ststlhPqW0LELrgye#:h2=Discord) ‚Äî free, great group text chat servers

**Full VTT** 

1. [Astral](https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/Cyanomys-Guide-To-Playing-RPGs-Online-v2.0-Ef83ststlhPqW0LELrgye#:h2=Astral-Tabletop) ‚Äî the most features and storage available on any Free subscription tier
2. [Tableplop](https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/Cyanomys-Guide-To-Playing-RPGs-Online-v2.0-Ef83ststlhPqW0LELrgye#:h2=Tableplop) ‚Äî a super simple VTT made by an indie developer, currently free
3. [Roll20](https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/Cyanomys-Guide-To-Playing-RPGs-Online-v2.0.1-Ef83ststlhPqW0LELrgye#:h2=Roll20) ‚Äî They used to be *the* free option, but now their free tier seems less great because storage space is extremely limited and no dynamic lighting

**Reference** 
There are some really great *free* RPGs out there, such as:

- [Lamentations of the Flame Princess](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/115059/LotFP-Rules--Magic-Free-Version)
- [Stars Without Number](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/230009/Stars-Without-Number-Revised-Edition-Free-Version)
- [Open Legend RPG](https://openlegendrpg.com/)
- [Eclipse Phase 2e](https://robboyle.wordpress.com/eclipse-phase-pdfs/)
[](https://openlegendrpg.com/)- [Degenesis](https://degenesis.com/game)
- [FATE Core](https://www.evilhat.com/home/fate-core-downloads/)
[](https://degenesis.com/game)- [Some Storybrewers games](https://storybrewersroleplaying.com/freegames/)
- [Lady Blackbird](http://www.onesevendesign.com/ladyblackbird/)
- [Marvel Super Heroes Roleplaying](http://www.classicmarvelforever.com/cms/)
- [Labyrinth Lord](http://goblinoidgames.com/index.php/downloads/)
- [Basic Fantasy Roleplaying Game](https://www.basicfantasy.org/)

Also take a look at the [SRDs section](https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/Cyanomys-Guide-To-Playing-RPGs-Online-v2.1.0--AyVHhmgvay5kAoffYZ82YExiAg-Ef83ststlhPqW0LELrgye#:h2=Online-SRDs), some non-free RPGs (such as Pathfinder) have their entire ruleset up online for free.


## You‚Äôre a power user or you like to tinker (and the rest of your group is willing to tolerate your antics.)

**A/V Conferencing & Chat** 

- [Discord](https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/Cyanomys-Guide-To-Playing-RPGs-Online-v2.0-Ef83ststlhPqW0LELrgye#:h2=Discord) ‚Äî BOTS! You can install so many bots to make your server better, or even develop your own.

**Full VTT** 

1. [Foundry](https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/Cyanomys-Guide-To-Playing-RPGs-Online-v2.0-Ef83ststlhPqW0LELrgye#:h2=Foundry-VTT) ‚Äî absolutely *the* VTT for power users, tinkerers, developers, etc. The head developer is active and communicative, and the community puts really good modules out at a surprisingly rapid rate.
2. [Fantasy Grounds](https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/Cyanomys-Guide-To-Playing-RPGs-Online-v2.0-Ef83ststlhPqW0LELrgye#:h2=Fantasy-Grounds) ‚Äî great if you prefer a high level of automation along with easy scripting and tons of community systems and modules.
3. [Roll20](https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/Cyanomys-Guide-To-Playing-RPGs-Online-v2.0-Ef83ststlhPqW0LELrgye#:h2=Roll20) ‚Äî there‚Äôs a super active modding community around Roll20.  Character sheets and scripts are written in well-known web programming languages, but since it is quite a hefty browser-based application already it is very prone to script-bloat
4. [Tabletop Simulator](https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/Cyanomys-Guide-To-Playing-RPGs-Online-v2.0-Ef83ststlhPqW0LELrgye#:h2=Tabletop--Simulator) ‚Äî there‚Äôs a big modding community centered on TTS, not just for RPGs but also for board games.  Obviously the 3D aspect makes the development skills required a little different than the other options listed here.


## Impressive maps and showmanship are really important to you.

See [Astral](https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/Cyanomys-Guide-To-Playing-RPGs-Online-v2.0-Ef83ststlhPqW0LELrgye#:h2=Astral-Tabletop) ‚Äî it has the best support for asset-based map building, animation, flashy Dynamic lighting, audio and map triggers, etc.


## You just want it to feel like you‚Äôre sitting at a real table.

See [Tabletop Simulator](https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/Cyanomys-Guide-To-Playing-RPGs-Online-v2.0-Ef83ststlhPqW0LELrgye#:h2=Tabletop--Simulator).  If that makes you queasy, the next best thing is [Fantasy Grounds.](https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/Cyanomys-Guide-To-Playing-RPGs-Online-v2.0-Ef83ststlhPqW0LELrgye#:h2=Fantasy-Grounds) Use [Zoom](https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/Cyanomys-Guide-To-Playing-RPGs-Online-v2.0-Ef83ststlhPqW0LELrgye#:h2=Zoom)‚Äôs picture-in-picture mode to add the missing face-to-face element.


## You *specifically* really hate Roll20 and you have an anarchist streak.

[Foundry.](https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/Cyanomys-Guide-To-Playing-RPGs-Online-v2.0-Ef83ststlhPqW0LELrgye#:h2=Foundry-VTT)  Atropos (the developer) is independent and definitely not ‚Äúcorporate.‚Äù


## You actually play Shadowrun.

[SRKit](https://www.reddit.com/r/ShadowrunKit/) is literally a VTT *just for playing Shadowrun*. If that‚Äôs not the most Shadowrun thing I‚Äôve ever seen, what is?

# Tips For Online Play
----------
## Communication Is Key

You absolutely have to stay in contact with the other members of your group.  Make sure that you have phone numbers, emails, and any relevant social media or instant messaging handles for each member. It‚Äôs important to have multiple points of contact in case someone loses their phone, loses internet connection, etc. 

Group text messaging can be extremely annoying and people have a tendency to ignore their email, so I advise that you use some sort of instant messaging app to keep in touch. Many people find it helpful to make a Discord server for their game, but it can be difficult to get people to use a new chat program they haven‚Äôt used before.  

Ask people what they already have on their phones: GroupMe? Facebook Messenger? Zoom? Try to utilize a central messaging platform that everyone already likes and uses.  After you establish a norm for playing online, *then* you can branch out and try something new.

## Use Video

A lot of people use voice-only calls to run their RPGs. This seems like the intuitive choice when you need to use a lot of your screen for a VTT.  However, this creates a new problem.  When using voice-only chat, especially with push-to-talk, people tend to check out much more because they know nobody is watching them and because they aren‚Äôt watching anybody else. This isn‚Äôt because they‚Äôre bad people or anything ‚Äî it‚Äôs just human nature. Additionally, role playing really *is* easier for many people when they can exchange facial expressions and gestures. Using video calls for your group can help increase everybody‚Äôs attentiveness and connectedness. 

## Meet Regularly

This is probably an important rule to follow for *any* successful RPG campaign, but it is especially true in online situations where people feel like they have less accountability.  Set a day and time that you will meet every week or every other week; and play an RPG at that time. Even if a couple players are gone, even if the GM feels unprepared, even if everybody would rather just sit around and bullshit this time ‚Äî **play** at the time you set out to play, or at least for some of that time.  If you don‚Äôt feel like you can run the game you‚Äôve been running, pull out a one page RPG, do 30 minutes of prep, and run that ‚Äî or even better, hand that one page RPG to one of your players and ask them to run it.  Humans are habitual creatures and the only way you are going to keep the momentum of your game going is to *keep playing.* 

Of course, there are still good reasons to skip a session: if the GM is ill and nobody else is willing to pick up a one-shot, if more players are gone than are left to play the missing characters, if there is an emergency or tragedy, if your work or school is on the line. But a lot of the reasons people skip games are not good reasons, and then it becomes easier and easier to skip a game until‚Ä¶..it peters out and you have no game at all. ü§∑ 

Many people also really struggle to get their group together every week or two.  My advice is to use [When2Meet](https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/Cyanomys-Guide-To-Playing-RPGs-Online-v2.0.1-Ef83ststlhPqW0LELrgye#:h2=When2Meet) to find a time that fairly consistently works for people each week.  Play with whichever people can make a consistent time most weeks ‚Äî even if that‚Äôs only 2 or 3 players.  *Only* if the majority of your group consists of shift workers who have no way of predicting their schedule, then I would recommend sending out a new When2Meet every Sunday or Monday to see when everyone can meet that week.  However, don‚Äôt forget that some people may be willing and able to ask for certain times off each week, and that if only one or two of your players have a shift-work schedule they can jump in and out depending on when they‚Äôre available.

I am aware that this kind of strictness may not work for every group, especially people who play a long beer and pretzels game a few times a year. That‚Äôs a perfectly fine way to play! But, if you really want a regular RPG game, you‚Äôre going to have to commit to it. Playing in a long-term (or even middle-term) RPG campaign is like signing up for a sports team: everyone is counting on you to be there.  It‚Äôs important to discuss this with all your players and make sure you‚Äôre on the same page about the kind of commitment they want to make *before* you even start trying to schedule it.


# Virtual Tabletops
## What is a VTT?
----------
****
A virtual tabletop, or ‚ÄúVTT‚Äù, for our purposes, is an all-in-one solution for using the internet to play tabletop RPGs.  When you use a VTT, you can play Dungeons and Dragons or almost any other RPG with your friends without needing to be sitting at the same table. This makes it viable to play with long-distance or socially distanced people. 

Virtual tabletops almost universally offer virtual battle maps, chat, and dice rolling, and sometimes they also handle character sheets, handouts, card decks, macros/automation, web cam and voice conferencing, mood music, and more. This section focuses on software that qualifies as a full-fledged VTT. 

Some people can be very intimidated by learning a complicated piece of software like a virtual tabletop, however.  A VTT can make it easier to play an RPG over a long distance, but not if the tool becomes a barrier to play. There are other options out there, some of which you may already be using. It‚Äôs important to remember that there are many ways to play with your friends, and the right tools for you are the ones you have the most fun with!

| ‚ö† **NOTE**: The VTTs presented below are *not* presented in order of best to worst.  They are categorized and then ordered by their popularity.  There is no such thing as a best or worst option for everybody. |

Roll20 is by far the most popular virtual tabletop on the market today, and for good reason.  It offers a wide selection of tools packaged in a pretty serviceable user interface, which people can access from their browsers for *free*.  It never costs money to play and there are two optional subscription tiers just for game masters.  Everybody has heard of it because it was the first browser-based VTT to compete against Fantasy Grounds, so help is easy to find.  

However, even though Roll20 has a lot of features, it also a lot of flaws. While its interface is simple, it‚Äôs not very intuitive, and core features can sometimes be very slow or downright buggy.  The developers rarely implement fixes or changes, and the community of Pro subscribers *pay* to create most new or innovative features. Corporate Roll20 has displayed that it does not respect the community or small RPG companies.

**Cost** 

- **Free** for all players & beginner GMs
- **üí∞ Plus** ‚Äî $4.99/mo for intermediate GMs
- **üí∞üí∞ Pro** ‚Äî$9.99/mo for advanced GMs

| - Ease of entry and low learning curve‚Äî only a browser and perhaps a webcam is required.  Roll20‚Äôs interface is fairly intuitive and you don‚Äôt need to be highly tech-saavy to use it. The basic functionality is easy to use and get running in minutes.<br>- A completely functional game of almost any RPG can be run completely for free. Subscription pricing is very reasonable.<br>- There are community-made character sheets available for *tons* of different games, even indie ones.  If you want to create a character sheet for your niche RPG, you can do it with a web coding knowledge.<br>- WOTC and Paizo partnerships mean popular RPG adventures and books are available to drop into games, usually with literally all the work (including dynamic lighting setup) done for you.<br>- Roll20 is extensible ‚Äî advanced functionality can be created with macros and scripts made by the community. If you know how to code, you can use the API to make scripts of your own.<br>- Most problems are experienced by advanced users (dynamic lighting, scripts, etc.) The core functionality works pretty solidly. | - There are a lot of features but Roll20 is definitely the jack of all trades, master of none. Many cool features are barely there/useable, such as jukebox upload, advanced dynamic lighting, compendium drag-n-drop, etc, or at best extremely clunky like the drawing tool.<br>- Subscription model means that if you use premium features you never truly ‚Äúown‚Äù your games.<br>- Dynamic lighting/advanced dynamic lighting, large maps, and maps with many assets are slow as fuck and may freeze the computers of your players if they‚Äôre playing on a Chromebook or something.<br>- Corporate is seemingly unresponsive to RPG companies who are not WOTC or Paizo.  There was also a lot of drama with corporate silencing criticism on Reddit and the forum, though the [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Roll20/comments/9j6k9s/subreddit_status_and_moderation_changes/) and discord are under new management.<br>- Development is very slow, unresponsive to requests that have been made for years, and often barely perceptible.  Roll20 seems content to sit back and do the bare minimum to rake in the cash.  Most improvements are made by the community via custom scripts‚Ä¶. by people who paid to have access to the API in the first place.  What changes Roll20 does make generally break everything. |

Fantasy Grounds is *the* OG virtual tabletop; it‚Äôs been around since 2004. There are many die-hard FG fans out there who absolutely adore the primo feeling of the UI, intense rule automation, and customizability that it offers.  Now that Fantasy Grounds Unity has come out, FG has once again topped the competition as having *the most* features.  FG is an absolute dream for PC gamers and people who play complicated RPGs that could greatly benefit from automation.  However, it‚Äôs probably not the best option for most average people, especially if you‚Äôre very new to the whole online-play thing.  It‚Äôs pretty expensive for the GM, so it requires a level of commitment that a lot of casual tabletop gamers aren‚Äôt ready for.  What‚Äôs more, getting to know the basic functionality can be complicated and intimidating, and the cluttery window-based interface is a nightmare for players who don‚Äôt have a large screen at their disposal.

**Cost** 

- **Free** to play in a game GM‚Äôd by someone with an Ultimate License.
- **Standard** ‚Äî $39.99 once or $3.99/month to play in and GM games with *only* other people who have the Standard license.
- **Ultimate** ‚Äî $149.99 once or $9.99/month to GM games for players using the free license.

**Features** 
Some of these features only apply to Fantasy Grounds Unity, which is in Open Access / Early Beta but will be released in full soon.  If you‚Äôre just jumping into Fantasy Grounds, you should really invest in FGU and not the classic version. FGU brought many modern features to Fantasy Grounds while maintaining backward compatibility.

| **All features require payment of some sort (see Cost section above)**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

| - FG offers **way more automation** than any other tabletop ever has.  Combat in D&D 5e can be almost *completely* automated.  Some people may LOVE this, some others wont.<br>- FG has **SO MANY FEATURES**, seriously.  If it‚Äôs there‚Äôs a VTT feature you‚Äôve ever wanted, FG probably has it. (except video calling and music)<br>- The 3D dice feel so much like rolling real dice! There‚Äôs a dice tower! The chat is a dice tray! Honestly the dice are incredibly charming.<br>- FG is expensive when compared to the free options for other VTTs, but considering it‚Äôs feature set, the price is comparable to the Pro Roll20 subscription and it offers WAY more features for the price.<br>- You can buy it once and completely own it without a subscription or subscribe to give it a try with less monetary commitment.<br>- If the GM gets the Ultimate subscription, players don‚Äôt have to pay (and lets face it, they never want to pay.)<br>- FG development is responsive and bugs are fixed quickly, so most of the features offered by the software *actually work*.<br>- The FG community is super involved and supportive.  They are constantly coming out with new modules to add even *more* features to your games.<br>- D&D 5e books are cheaper on FG than on Roll20 *and* D&D Beyond!  I still have no idea how this happened but it‚Äôs a great perk. | - The elephant in the room here is the UX/UI.  It‚Äôs very pretty, but dated.  Menus, buttons, etc do not use a design language that modern users are familiar with ‚Äî  and compounding that with the multitude of features, it is *horrible* to learn and use for people who aren‚Äôt used to gaming, tech-saavy or willing to put in the time. <br>- Also because of the UX/UI design, FG relies on tons and tons of tiny popup windows for almost every feature in the game.  This makes playing on a smaller screen an absolute nightmare (15‚Äù is uncomfortable ‚Äî 13‚Äù will make you want to die.) <br>- Because everything is so heavily automated, some homebrew rules can be really hard or just downright impossible to implement in existing game systems without programming.  Also it makes GM rulings and fudging somewhat difficult during combat because the software takes the wheel.<br>- There are no video call capabilities. This is more of a problem for FG than most VTTs because you really need your whole screen to use the software, so not having it built in means there‚Äôs not really room on your screen for it.<br>- FG Classic is built on **15 years** of code.  This means it took the developers a *long long* time to implement big new features or make big changes.  They started promising FG Unity during *fourth edition D&D* and the beta only just came out in 2019.  There is a promise that FGU will make development faster, but no way of knowing if that‚Äôs true as of yet.<br>- No music streaming capabilities.  This isn‚Äôt strictly necessary for a VTT, but considering how important it is to the users of other big-player VTTs it seems like a modern feature that FG is really lacking.<br>- There are fewer character sheets/systems offered by FG than you can find in some other VTTs, since systems are much more involved to program than for instance character sheets on Roll20 or especially Astral. CoreRPG does let you play any game on FG but it doesn‚Äôt provide the same experience as a custom-made character sheet. |

| - People who want tons of automation in their games ‚Äî this is especially useful for more crunchy, math-y RPGs like D&D 3.5 or Pathfinder 1e.<br>- People who want a very tabletop feel (those 3D dice are so good) but without the trouble or potential motion-sickness of setting up a completely 3D environment like Tabletop Simulator<br>- People who want to completely own their VTT experience without being shackled to a monthly or yearly subscription.<br>- People who appreciate having tons of cool little features all in one program | - People who play on small laptop screens ‚Äî also it‚Äôs completely impossible to install for players who use Chromebooks or iPads<br>- People who aren‚Äôt very good at (or don‚Äôt want to spend the time on) learning new software ‚Äî all the other big options detailed here are easier to learn, even Foundry<br>- People who want to play online completely for free ‚Äî look at Astral or Roll20<br>- People who play a lot of niche or indie RPGs ‚Äî Roll20 or Astral are your best bet |

Astral boasts the most intuitive UI/UX of any VTT out there.  It‚Äôs gorgeous and very easy to learn and use.  All of it‚Äôs core features ‚Äî including Dynamic Lighting! ‚Äî are available *at the Free tier*, with 1GB of free storage.  It supports numerous games right out of the box, but adding any new RPG actually *requires no coding knowledge* because character sheets are just PDFs with changeable text and die rolling buttons plopped on top of them.  It‚Äôs missing a few features compared to Roll20, but the many features that it does have are implemented in a much more finished and useable way, and the developers are extremely responsive to community requests.

Astral has grown *so much* since I first made this guide.  I am amazed that the small dev team has managed so much improvement over such a short period of time.   When I started the new guide, I sucked it up and said that Roll20 was hands-down the best option for most casual tabletop players.  Once I rediscovered Astral, I realized I was wrong.  

**For the vast majority of people, Astral is the easiest, cheapest, most flexible VTT for playing RPGs online.** Though it is missing a couple features compared to Roll20, it more than makes up for it by being consistent, functional, affordable, and easy to pick up ****for people new to VTTs.

**Cost** 

- **Free** for all players and all core features, 1 GB storage
- **üí∞üí∞** **Pro** ‚Äî $9.99/mo or $99.99/year for access to 12,000+ assets, 20 GB storage, and a larger action (macro) bar

**Features** 
You can see the current feature requests [here](https://support.astraltabletop.com/c/feedback/l/top/all?order=votes).  Generally, features that are strongly desired by the community come first.  Development on Astral is active and responsive, and they have been adding new features as quickly as possible without stability issues, so those feature requests are actually likely to be implemented in the near future.

The chat does fully support Markdown, so quick in-game info handouts can be easily copy-pasted into chat with nice formatting ‚Äî they‚Äôre a pain to find later, however, and if you need to prepare them ahead of time you‚Äôll have to get them ready in a Markdown editor of some sort for easy editing and copy-pasting.<br>    - üòï No playing cards or easy rollable tables yet, though they can be simulated to some extent via custom die rolls.<br>    - üíô 1GB cloud storage for all handouts, map assets, music, etc<br>        - **üí∞üí∞** Pro users get **20GB** which is a huge amount of space<br>- Automation<br>    - ‚úÖ There is a combat tracker that tracks rounds, supports hidden combatants, adding all from a map<br>    - üíô Sheets available all have clickable rolls, and they can be modified for house rules or new sheets with clickable rolls can be easily created, no coding required.<br>    - ‚úÖ Sheets actions and common roles can be saved to a token‚Äôs action bar for frequent use <br>        - **üí∞üí∞** Pro doubles the size of the action bar<br>    - üíô Map triggers allow for fancy map effects & changes<br>    - üíô Dynamic audio can tie audio effects to specific places on the map<br>    - ‚ùå There is not an open API available yet, so there are no community scripts or modules to add extra functionality.  There is a library of ‚Äúsystems‚Äù or character sheets created by the community, however.<br>- Music & Video Streaming<br>    - ‚ùå No integrated voice/video calls<br>    - üíô  GM can upload music, easily organize it into playlists, and stream it simultaneously to all players computers.  Audio can even be tied to maps or specific places on maps and fine-tuned.<br>- Extras<br>    - üòï  Astral supports using the initiative tracker and music on tablet and phone browsers.  Some people have been able to get the full experience to work on tablet browsers with the use of a bluetooth keyboard and mouse.<br>    - üíô  Basic and advanced tutorials are available immediately when you sign up which walk you through learning the program, as well as a complete help center and several community-created guides<br>    - ‚úÖ The community forums and Discord are very helpful, and developers are highly responsive |

| - Astral runs completely in the browser, no install required.<br>- The Free tier has more features and storage than any other modern VTT‚Äôs free option ‚Äî even Dynamic Lighting!<br>- Almost every feature that is advertised is implemented elegantly and works consistently.<br>- The UI/UX of Astral is very intuitive and easy to learn, even for people who are borderline tech-illiterate.  You can also apply themes to customize the look of the app, in case you don‚Äôt like the default dark mode.<br>- Development is extremely responsive to community requests and works rapidly to add features and fix bugs.<br>- Astral is the *only* VTT with easy-to-customize/create character sheets without knowing anything about programming or web coding.<br>- If you like building pretty maps out of tiles and assets, Astral really shines at it.  It‚Äôs even useful as a map builder alone, only outclassed by the likes of DungeonPainter Studio.<br>- As far as I can tell Astral seems to suffer a lot less bloat, memory leaks, slowdown, etc than other popular VTTs. I'm guessing this is probably due to designing it from the ground up to include many features that were only later tacked on to older VTTs, and also because it likely uses more modern principles of web development. | - Astral has RTS Fog of War but no Simple Fog of War, which some GMs may dislike when they need to throw something together quickly without drawing Dynamic Lighting walls.<br>- Astral is missing a drawing tool, which may be a problem for GMs who like to draw their maps on the fly (though drawing tools in comparible VTTs are laughable bad, at least they have them.)  This can be somewhat worked around by using a different drawing program to scribble down maps, then exporting the image and placing in Astral.<br>- Basic handout/notes functionality outside of charater sheets and PDFs is nonexistent right now. Handouts can only be distributed by using an outside method, such as the group‚Äôs video chat service (Discord or Zoom), or by pasting into Astral‚Äôs chat.<br>- There has been a huge influx of users recently due to COVID-19, and the servers are struggling to manage all the traffic.  The developers are currently scrambling to make upgrades so Astral can keep running smoothly. |

| - Anybody who wants a quick, elegant, seamless VTT ‚Äî especially people who struggle with learning complicated software.<br>- People who want advanced features like dynamic lighting on a budget.<br>- People who want to play a less popular RPGs online and want an easy way to create a familiar, fully automated character sheet without coding<br>- Anybody who is tired of fighting with their VTT‚Äôs fiddly user interface, slow development, bad customer service, or difficult to use features.<br>- People who like using impressive maps and showmanship in their games ‚Äî Astral can do animated battle maps, beauitful map-building, fancy dynamic lighting backgrounds, music, sound effect triggers, map triggers, weather effects, and more. | - People who need WotC adventures available for purchase and importable into games. Look at Roll20 or Fantasy Grounds instead.<br>- People who like to tinker with the bones of VTTs by making or using community scripts and modules. Look at Foundry, Roll20, or Fantasy Grounds instead.<br>- People who heavily rely on Fog of War instead of Dynamic Lighting ‚Äî Look at Tableplop instead.<br>- People who make use of drawing tools and rich text/image handouts during their games and need those features to be available *inside* the VTT. Look at Roll20, Foundry, or Fantasy Grounds instead.<br>- People with players who have trouble paying attention ‚Äî a browser-based solution may not be for you. Look at Fantasy Grounds or Tabletop Simulator. |

I remember when Foundry VTT was just a smol honorable mention on the old document, and look at how far it‚Äôs come. :smiletear:  Honestly, if I were to describe it Foundry VTT it‚Äôs almost as if someone took all of their pent-up anger at Roll20 and used it to build something similar but 100x better in every tiny way. üòâ For power users, tinkerers, and tech nerds Foundry is *the* VTT that you want.  Don‚Äôt look anywhere else.  No, not even Fantasy Grounds ‚Äî do you really want something built on that much old spaghetti code?  Foundry uses modern web technologies to create a super feature-rich experience that is infinitely customizable.  The developer is extremely responsive, and already a large community has grown up around Foundry with modules that can do almost anything. Foundry really puts the ultimate power in your hands.

However, if you‚Äôre intimidated by technology, or if any of your group plays on crappy, tiny chromebooks, Foundry isn‚Äôt for you.

**Cost** 
Foundry is available for a one-time purchase of $50. Only the GM needs to subscribe or buy the license.  The developer also has a Patreon for people who want special Discord perks and input on development.

You can run Foundry straight from your computer for no additional cost as long as you set up port-fowarding on your router (similar to Fantasy Grounds).  It will only be available online to your players when you have the program running, however.

[The Forge](https://forgevtt.com/) is a third-party cloud provider that puts Foundry completely in the cloud (like Roll20) without needing to host it from your computer, fiddle with port forwarding, or set up your own server.  It has an *additional* cost of between $4 and $13 per month.

[Foundry Gaming Server](https://www.foundryserver.com/) is another third-party cloud provider for Foundry, which is currently free during the beta period.

You can also host Foundry on your own dedicated server, using cloud hosting providers like Digital Ocean or Linode, for as little as $5 a month.  Though there are tutorials available, that will inevitably require technical knowledge.

**Features** 

| - Battlemaps<br>    - ‚úÖ Shared battlemaps with player- and GM-controlled tokens<br>    - üíô Awesome drawing function which also works great with digitizer pens!<br>    - ‚úÖ Map-making tools ‚Äî it can set background images and do tiling for repeating textures, and the tiles-browser module turns it into a full assets-focused map builder <br>    - üíô A simple ruler along with the ability to measure and create cone, circle, and rectangle templates that are moveable and easy to edit<br>    - üòï Fog of War ‚Äî only RTS-Style Fog of War, no simple FoW.<br>    - üíô Advanced Fog of War ‚Äî tokens can see in the dynamic lighting where they‚Äôve been in the past!

| - Foundry is *very* nearly as powerful and feature-rich as Fantasy Grounds, but far easier and more intuitive to use.<br>- The developer is very responsive to community requests and built Foundry from the ground-up to empower community developers to create their own modules (look at this [huge list](https://foundry-vtt-community.github.io/wiki/Community-Modules/))<br>- Once it is officially released in May, Foundry will be a one-time purchase that only the GM needs to make ‚Äî no ongoing subscription unless the GM uses cloud hosting or The Forge, and no burden on players.<br>- Players only need a browser to access the game and never need to install software.<br>- Most of the little things that annoy you in other VTTs (especially Roll20) have been purposefully fixed in Foundry. | - Foundry may not work out-of-the-box on small (13‚Äù or smaller) screens, however some finagling and character sheet modules can make it work better.<br>- Foundry is in constant development and the modules are always changing.  This means that sometimes things can break, though they are often swiftly fixed.<br>- Foundry has RTS Fog of War but no Simple Fog of War, which some GMs may dislike when they need to throw something together quickly without drawing Dynamic Lighting walls.<br>- Foundry setup *can* be pretty technical ‚Äî it requires port forwarding or subscription to a cloud service, not to mention the many modules that a GM has to choose from. The Forge fixes this issue entirely but requires a monthly subscription. |

Tabletop Simulator (‚ÄúTTS‚Äù) has been growing in popularity and is a great tool for remote play.  Like it says on the tin, TTS allows you to make a virtual tabletop and invite up to 10 people (including yourself) to it.  Uniquely among all the VTTs, TTS feels a lot like interacting with a video game.  If you and your players are familiar with camera controls for 1st or 3rd person games (you can change the setting for that), you‚Äôll intuitively grasp the core controls of TTS.  Much like Roll20 and others, it has a menu bar for different pointer tools that you can use to manipulate objects, draw, etc.  Also uniquely for VTTs, TTS offers three dimensions and simulated physics.  It has VR integration as well, though I cannot speak to how well it works.  Unlike Fantasy Grounds, which has different windows for every reference document, in TTS you will place your reference documents on hovering boards that you have to turn your camera to examine, or you‚Äôll access them through a virtual tablet object that has a web browser.  Many people host their own content on Google Drive or other cloud storage and access it in-game through the tablet feature.  Presenting information in a 3D space means you don‚Äôt hog as much screen space as something like Fantasy Grounds, but I would still recommend a full keyboard to use the F1-F12 keys to rapidly switch between pointer types.

TTS has the added perk of Steam integration, so you can link up through your existing social contacts and guiltily check your total time in-game every time you launch it.  The Steam overlay gives in-game chat and voice features, but no video.  It is also supports many other games as DLCs or Workshop downloads, for when your no-show player turns D&D night into a board game night.  One flaw of TTS is that the GM‚Äôs computer will be acting as a server for the game (rather than a cloud-based platform), which means all the data is on the GM‚Äôs machine and if they lose connection, people get kicked out.  Also, if the GM isn‚Äôt running the server, then in-game data is inaccessible to players.

**Cost** 

Tabletop Simulator is $19.99 on Steam, or $59.99 for a 4-pack.  Every player needs a copy of the game to play.  DLCs are available and range from $5 to $15, but most of those are board and card games, rather than RPG content.

**Features** 

| - Battlemaps<br>    - üíô Shared battlemaps with player- and GM-controlled tokens: Battlemaps feel just like you‚Äôre sitting at the table, except it‚Äôs much cheaper to put your 5‚Äô long high resolution epic battle map into the game than it is to print it out in real life.  <br>        - There are permissions you can give or take away from players, but they‚Äôre not very granular.  Most of the time, each player will have as much control as they would in person (i.e. if they want to chuck dice at your dragon mini, they can).  <br>        - There are a few animated miniatures that come with the game, but you‚Äôll end up browsing the workshop or making your own miniatures most of the time.  Still faster than painting up your skeleton horde by hand.  <br>        - You can save groups of objects (such as a battlemap and all the enemy models) and load them into the game as a group.  <br>        - Also, each player‚Äôs cursor displays as an individually-colored 2D hand-in game that they can use to point to objects, and the Tab key drops an arrow where you‚Äôre pointing and makes a chime to get the attention of other players.  <br>    - ‚úÖ Basic drawing capabilities:  You can draw on the table and place text boxes.  The system doesn‚Äôt do much to let you mark objects, though.<br>    - ‚úÖ Map-making tools:  You can import 2D maps from external files to create a surface image on a board.  You can also drop in 3D models you have created externally or collected from the Workshop or DLCs.<br>    - üòï Ruler:  The game has a built in ruler that measures in inches or centimeters.  Precise measurement can sometimes be difficult because you‚Äôre looking at a 3D space without binocular vision, so depth perception suffers.  Frequently when you measure from one point to another, other players will perceive you measuring from the wrong point.  Perhaps VR fixes this issue.  I don‚Äôt own any VR equipment, so I can‚Äôt say.<br>    - üòï Fog of War and Dynamic Lighting:  You can create quadrilateral ‚Äúhidden zones‚Äù that can be used to hide stuff from players, but it doesn‚Äôt prevent physics interactions.  Also in a 3D space it gets a little wonky to cover everything you need to without obscuring stuff you don‚Äôt need to. <br>- Chat & Dice<br>    - ‚úÖ Basic chat:  There is an in-game chat and access to chat through the Steam overlay.  There are no chat roll commands because it kinda defeats the purpose of TTS.<br>    - ‚ùå Die rolls from character sheets:  Character sheets (see below) do not integrate with the game in this manner.  Again, if you‚Äôre using TTS you‚Äôre trying to recreate the ‚Äúat the table‚Äù feeling. <br>    - üíô Visual (non-chat) dice rolling interface:  This is the bread-and-butter of the game‚Äôs dice support.  You can create as many 3D dice as you want, of any size you want.  You roll them with the press of a button and if you hover your cursor over the selected dice (which are highlighted in your color), it displays individual die rolls and the sum of all dice as a tool-tip.<br>- Character Sheets<br>    - ‚ùå Character sheets for various games:  You‚Äôre responsible for bringing your own.  Either have a paper sheet in front of you, create one in game, or load it on an in-game ‚Äútablet‚Äù from the internet.<br>    - ‚úÖ Moving character sheets between games:  You can save objects to your own device, so if you have your character sheet built as an object in game, you can transport it yourself.  Make sure to update the save file at the end of each session though!<br>    - üòï Custom character sheet creation:  Is almost necessary, because the game doesn‚Äôt come with any.<br>- Compendium<br>    - ‚ùå Game SRDs available:  Not supported.<br>    - ‚ùå Game rules available for purchase or upload:  There are Workshop files people have made that have commonly-referenced rules on pre-positioned floating boards.  Most of the time, you‚Äôll probably use an external source.<br>    - ‚ùå Drag-n-drop to character sheets:  Not supported.<br>- Handouts, Etc<br>    - ‚úÖ Types of handouts able to be edited and displayed:  Anything you can make in-game or find on the Workshop can be put in front of players as a 3D model.<br>    - üíô Playing cards, random tables:  Tons of support for this.<br>    - üíô Storage:  You can save objects or groups of objects and import them onto the VTT when you need them.  Storage is done locally, so you don‚Äôt have to worry about paying for more space.<br>- Automation<br>    - ‚ùå I‚Äôm addressing this category as a whole because none of it is really supported.  It goes against the ethos behind TTS; that is, the game is designed to make you feel like you‚Äôre sitting at a table and playing manually.  About the most you‚Äôll get is being able to import groups of objects you have saved or from the Steam Workshop.   However, virtual tablet integration enables you to access automation tools you would otherwise use at the table.<br>- Music & Video Streaming<br>    - üòï Integrated voice & video calls: You can place voice calls from the Steam overlay, but video is unsupported.  <br>    - üòï Stream uploaded music to players:  You can use a tablet to link to a youtube playlist or other internet service to stream synchronized music.  I have experienced issues with finding volumes that work for everyone though.<br>- Extras<br>    - ‚ùå Mobile device support:  Not supported.<br>    - üòï Help & support:  Most of your content will be self-created, so only issues with the underlying software will be supported.<br>    - üíô Community:  Active and thriving community with tons of free fan content. |

| - **Virtually anything you can do at a real life table, you can do here, and more.**  <br>- Local storage (as opposed to cloud) means you can use up as much space as you need.<br>- The initial cost is low and there are no recurring subscription fees.<br>- Tons of community content that is easy to import.<br>- Useful for things other than RPGs.  If you and all your friends get TTS, you can play many board games together too!<br>- You can flip the table!<br>- The 3D dice are even better than Fantasy Grounds‚Äô! You can throw the, drop them, scatter them, whatever you want, and you can even have different colors. | - GM‚Äôs machine will be the server for the game, and if you lose connection then everyone gets kicked out until it comes back.<br>- Each player *and* the GM must purchase the program.<br>- No cloud-hosted repository means your data is not backed up.<br>- Almost no automation features.<br>- No default character sheets in game and making your own requires advanced knowledge of the VTT. However ‚Äî a browser on the in-game ‚Äútablet‚Äù can be used to reference digital sheets on D&D Beyond, Mythweavers, etc.<br>- Concealing portions of the map is difficult.<br>- No good way to integrate private notes into the UI for the GM.<br>- Because the game‚Äôs host acts as the server, it needs to be run on a reasonably powerful computer (that is, not somebody‚Äôs budget college laptop). |

| Tabletop Simulator **is GREAT for:**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Tabletop Simulator **is NOT for:**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

| - People who want to have the feeling of sitting at the gaming table.<br>- People with VR equipment that want a chance to use it.<br>- People using a full keyboard with separate function keys (not a laptop keyboard).  This allows for quick selection of different in-game tools (i.e. rulers and pointers).<br>- People who have flakey players and need to rapidly convert RPG night into board game night.<br>- People who want to have complete ownership (with no subscriptions.) | - People who hate video games or get motion sick from them.<br>- People that are uncomfortable interacting with 3D digital environments.  If you can‚Äôt work a first-person shooter, you‚Äôre going to struggle with this game.  Seriously, the UI is great, but it‚Äôs ultimately a sandbox video game.<br>- People playing games that benefit from automation features and quick rules references.<br>- People with unreliable computers.  Everything is stored locally, so if your machine gets hit by lightning, you might lose your setups if you don‚Äôt manually back them up. |



## Indie Passion Projects
----------

I would like to eventually do more in-depth reviews of these options, but these things take a lot of time and effort, and indie projects can change very rapidly and sometimes disappear completely. If anyone uses one of these VTTs for a game and has opinions, please contact me so we can make a better review!  You can even write your own review using the Key at the top of this document as a guide.

[**Tableplop**](https://www.tableplop.com/)
Tableplop is a great VTT for groups who want as little fuss or complication as possible.  It is really great for scribbling maps or uploading assets and backgrounds, and it has Fog of War, a turn tracker, chat, and a dice roller ‚Äî everything you need to get playing online immediately. The interface is so smooth and friendly too! There is a decent integrated character sheet for D&D 5e, but people playing other games can still make use of most of the other features and use a sheet from the resources in the **Sharing Character Sheets** section below.

[**Let‚Äôs Role**](https://lets-role.com)
Let‚Äôs Role is a *gorgeous* VTT project that rivals even the likes of Astral. The interface is very user friendly, and it even has features such as music, 3D dice, a complete journal, and a graphical (non-programming) character sheet builder!  However, it‚Äôs in early access so you have to get your account approved to make games, it only has *built-in* D&D5e or generic character sheets for now, and there is no dynamic lighting feature. Despite that, this VTT deserves to be in the Up & Comers section as soon as I have the time.

[**Beyond Tabletop**](https://www.beyondtabletop.com/)
Beyond Tabletop is a complete online VTT that is based entirely in Google Drive.  It is comparible to many of the more popular VTTs, except that you don‚Äôt have to pay a subscription for storage because it stores everything in your Google Drive. It‚Äôs different from most other VTTs because it uses a more paginiated interface instead of windows layered on top of a desktop or battlemap. Some people will *love* the interface, and some people will hate it. 

[**Talespire**](https://talespire.com/) [](https://talespire.com/)
This is still in Early Access and I‚Äôm not really suited to review it (and unfortunately my husband doesn‚Äôt use this one.)  However, from what I can tell it looks a lot like an RPG-focused Tabletop Simulator. 

| ‚ö† **Caution**: Do not under any circumstances purchase GM Forge. It‚Äôs not a virus or anything but it‚Äôs a completely dead project with lots of broken parts, and therefore a huge waste of your time and money. It‚Äôs a shame it‚Äôs still up on the Steam store.  The good news is, Foundry was inspired by GM Forge, so if you had high hopes for GM Forge‚Ä¶go look at Foundry.<br><br>Additionally, Skirmish VTT seemed promising but has been abandoned since March 2018. |



## Open Source
----------

Open source software are community created and completely free to use, and free to modify however you want.  The great thing about open source software is that it‚Äôs completely free. The bad thing is that it is often very hodge-podge because so many people with so many ideas contribute to it.

[**MapTool**](https://www.rptools.net/toolbox/maptool/)
The most popular open-source option in the English-speaking world.

[**Rolisteam**](https://rolisteam.org/)
An open source VTT popular with those who speak French, but which has been recently translated to English in it‚Äôs entirety.

[**Mythic Table**](http://www.mythictable.com/)
A very fancy-looking open-source VTT that has yet to come out. You can subscribe to an email list for updates on development, though.


## Old Favorites
----------

Here are some crusty old VTTs from the days of yore.  Honestly, if you‚Äôre new to playing online I do not recommend these.  However if you have very niche preferences or requirements, you may find your perfect match here. 

[**EpicTable**](http://www.epictable.com/)
[](http://www.epictable.com/)For people who really liked Microsoft Word 2010.

[**D20 Pro**](https://d20pro.com/)
[](https://d20pro.com/)Finally, a VTT just for people who play d20 games?

[**Battlegrounds RPG**](http://battlegroundsgames.com/)
[](http://battlegroundsgames.com/)Like MapTool, but not open-source and more user friendly.


# VTT A La Carte
----------

What follows are a bunch of standalone tools for accomplishing many of the disperate things a VTT might do.  This can be useful if you want to combine different kinds of tools and uses (such as using a character sheet from one place, and battlemaps in another.) You might also be interested in using some of these resources for replacing missing or lackluster pieces from your chosen VTT.

## Sync Battlemaps

[**Shmeppy**](https://shmeppy.com)
A digital wet-erase mat with some virtual battlemap features usually found in a VTT such as fog of war, tokens, a ruler, and a laser pointer. This is perfect for people who like to draw their maps on the fly. Note that it only does hand-drawn battlemaps, not uploaded images.

[**I Met A Troll**](https://imetatroll.com/)
Simply 16-bit map making & sharing with some VTT-like features, such as audio/video and the 5e SRD compendium.

[**Planar Ally**](https://github.com/Kruptein/PlanarAlly) ****
A complete, free virtual battlemap application with drawing, fog of war, dynamic lighting, image import, tokens, and a fancy ruler.  The GM will need to host it from their computer.

[**3D Virtual Tabletop**](http://www.3dvtt.com/) ****
Somewhat similar to Tabletop Simulator, but it runs in the browser and it‚Äôs just for RPG maps.

[**Game Master Engine**](https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/ftl3wr/oc_game_master_engine_is_now_free_to_download/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x)
This is a really cool 3-D map building/sharing tool, like Minecraft but just for RPGs (and specifically it looks better suited to fantasy games like D&D.)

[**Owlbear Rodeo**](https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/g1uxs1/oc_owlbear_rodeo_a_simple_way_to_run_dnd/)
This is a dead-simple, no-frills simple map sharing application that you don‚Äôt even need to make an account to use.  There is no ruler, Fog of War, etc.  Interestingly, it has an experimental feature to beam music to your players from another tab in your browser (like Youtube,) however I haven‚Äôt personally been able to get that to work.

## Roll Dice

**Roll Physical Dice**
Use the honor system, or tilt your camera down to your desk if people get suspicious.

**Dice Rolling Apps**
You can roll dice on your phone and show the phone to your webcam (assuming you‚Äôre not using your phone *as* your webcam.)

**Discord Bots**

- [Avrae](https://avrae.io/) ‚Äî does dice rolling and much, much more for D&D 5e. It was acquired by D&D Beyond and full DDB integration is planned for the future.
- [Sidekick](https://github.com/ArtemGr/Sidekick) ‚Äî dice rolling, playing cards, and macros
- [Dice Parser](https://top.gg/bot/279722369260453888) ‚Äî full-featured dice rolling sytax based on Rolisteam
- [Dice Maiden](https://top.gg/bot/377701707943116800) ‚Äî a general dice roller with special support for WoD, Fudge, and WH40K rolls
- General purpose bots ‚Äî some general purpose bots already have dice rolling incorporated.

**Online Dice Rollers**

- [Roll Dice With Friends](http://rolldicewithfriends.com/)
- [Rolz Dice Rooms](https://rolz.org/join)
- [Teal 3D Dice](http://a.teall.info/mdice/)
- [Roll For Your Party](https://rollforyour.party/room/IndirectlyEmergingFoxhound)

**Special Dice**

- [RPG Sessions](https://rpgsessions.com/) dice and character sheets for FFG Star Wars & Genesys
- [Savage Bot](https://github.com/alessio29/savagebot) ‚Äî discord bot for dice, cards, bennies, initiative, and more for Savage Worlds
[****](http://a.teall.info/mdice/)## Video, Voice, and Text Chat

Note: It‚Äôs a good idea to have your group set up to use a backup option in case your usual video call program goes down or the servers get overloaded, especially in a time like this.

[**Discord**](https://discordapp.com/)
Discord is the ultimate chat program for gamers, including those of the tabletop varienty.  The voice and video call clarity is excellent.  You can make ‚Äúservers‚Äù for your games (like group instant message but with channels that have different topics), and discord has a wide variety of bots you might find useful.  You can even join large, world-wide servers just for talking about different RPGs, VTTs, etc.

Here are some of my favorite bots for a TTRPG campaign server:

- [RPG Schedule](https://www.rpg-schedule.com/games/my-games) ‚Äî Schedule events and remind your players of them.
- Dice bots (see section above) ‚Äî Dice! And sometimes even character sheets, initiative tracking, and more!
- [Simple Poll](https://top.gg/bot/simplepoll) ‚Äî Polls!
- [Starboard](https://top.gg/bot/655390915325591629) ‚Äî Memorialize the hilarious stuff your players say in chat.
- [RoomBot](https://top.gg/bot/592816310656696341) ‚Äî For creating temporary play-by-post or voice role play rooms.

[**Jitsi**](https://jitsi.org/)
Jisti is a completely free, open-source alternative to Zoom. I‚Äôm listing it first however, because if you‚Äôre not using Discord, Jitsi is probably the best option for most people. If you‚Äôre using a computer, there‚Äôs nothing you have to download and no accounts you have to make ‚Äî just sign in via a browser and you get a complete video call experience (unlike Zoom, which has a browser client but it is limited compared to the desktop client.)  People can even join your call by phone if they‚Äôre on the road or if their internet goes out.  

[**Zoom**](https://zoom.us/)
I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôve heard of Zoom by now, what with the pandemic and all.  Using Zoom on a personal account for group calls of longer than 40 minutes requires a $15/month subscription.  For most people, Discord and Jitsi are better options ‚Äî they‚Äôre free.

However, if you live somewhere that has really spotty internet and still really want to use video, Zoom is what you want.  It ‚Äúrobots‚Äù and freezes far less on slow internet connections, probably due to it‚Äôs background as a tool often used by business professionals on shitty hotel WiFI.  

Another big benefit of Zoom is that you can minimize it to Picture-in-Picture mode, which means you can still see the video while you have your VTT open.  This is especially important for full-screen programs like Fantasy Grounds and Tabletop Simulator.

[**Skype**](https://www.skype.com/en/)
The main draw for Skype over Zoom, Jitsi, & Discord is that it has Picture-in-Picture mode but you don‚Äôt need a subscription. Otherwise, skip it. The call quality is meh compared to the other options and it‚Äôs spammy.


## Character Sheets

**Dead Trees**
Print/copy a character sheet. Write on it.

**Shared PDFs**
Most RPGs have a fillable PDF version of the character sheet. All you have to do to make that character sheet visible to your group is put it on an online PDF-sharing application, such as:

- [Kami](https://www.kamiapp.com/)
- [DocHub](https://dochub.com/)
- [Lumin PDF](https://www.luminpdf.com/)

**Google Sheets**
Hobbiests have made character sheets using Google Sheets for various RPGs, which is a great idea because they can implement auto-calculation and can be easily shared and collaborated on. 

- [Here](https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/Google-Sheets-Character-Sheet-Compendium--Ax~LSxYkXKa3QXAJefbuoWv3AQ-JGB67hhTsDaioD0icFT5h) is a list of character sheets I‚Äôve found on GSheets.

[**MythWeavers**](https://www.myth-weavers.com/)
The oldest way to share character sheets on the internet, Mythweavers has character sheets for just about any RPG.

**D&D Beyond**
See the section on [D&D Beyond](https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/Cyanomys-Guide-To-Playing-RPGs-Online-v2.1.0-Ef83ststlhPqW0LELrgye#:h2=DnD-Beyond).

**Other D&D Character Managers**
I‚Äôm surprised these are sticking around after the advent of D&D Beyond, but I guess ‚Äúfree‚Äù is always a huge selling point.

- [DiceCloud](https://dicecloud.com/) ‚Äî The material interface can be a bit tricky, but it works really nicely on phones and tablets.
- [Dungeon Master‚Äôs Vault](https://www.dungeonmastersvault.com/) ‚Äî a fork of the old OrcPub.
- [Adventurer‚Äôs Codex](https://adventurerscodex.com/) ‚Äî Probably the best non-D&D Beyond standalone option for putting a D&D character sheet on the cloud.

[**RPG Sessions**](https://rpgsessions.com/)
A character manager and dice roller for FFG Star Wars and Genesys systems, with a Discord Bot to boot!

**Mobile Apps**
There are tons of apps on both the Android and Apple stores for managing the character sheets of various games.  Most of them don‚Äôt have the ability to share with the GM, however.


## Rules Reference

[**Drivethru RPG**](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/)
Nowadays, most RPGs have PDFs available for purchase here ‚Äî D&D 5e being the notable exception.

**D&D Beyond**
See the section on [D&D Beyond](https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/Cyanomys-Guide-To-Playing-RPGs-Online-v2.1.0-Ef83ststlhPqW0LELrgye#:h2=DnD-Beyond).

**Online SRDs**
Some games have great online SRDs. Here are some examples:

- [D&D 5e](https://5thsrd.org/)
- [Pathfinder 1e](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/)
- [Pathfinder 2e](https://2e.aonprd.com/)
- [FATE](https://fate-srd.com/)
- [13th Age](https://www.13thagesrd.com/)
- [Dungeon World](https://www.dungeonworldsrd.com/)
- [Blades in the Dark](https://bladesinthedark.com/greetings-scoundrel)
- [Open Legend RPG](https://openlegendrpg.com/)
- [Mutants & Masterminds](https://www.d20herosrd.com/)
- [Basic Fantasy RPG](https://www.dustinian.com/_prototypes/bfrpg_srd.html)
- [Degenesis](https://degenesis.com/game)
## Turn Tracking 

**System-Specific Combat Trackers**

- [Improved Initiative](https://www.improved-initiative.com/) ‚Äî Probably the best 5e combat manager ever besides the one in Fantasy Grounds. It even hooks up with [Kobold Fight Club.](https://kobold.club/fight/#/encounter-builder)
- [SWRPG Combat Tracker](http://unholycow.com/swrpg/initiative.html)
- [Dungeon Master‚Äôs Vault](https://www.dungeonmastersvault.com/) ‚Äî like the good old orcpub
- Game Master 5th Edition ‚Äî phone/tablet app available on [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lionsden.gamemaster5&hl=en_US) and [Apple](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/game-master-5th-edition/id908176026)

**Discord Bots**

- [Avrae](https://avrae.io/)
- [Savage Bot](https://github.com/alessio29/savagebot)
## Syncing Real-Time Music & Sound Effects

Trying to beam battle music across the waves to your players is actually one of the hardest things to do without a VTT.  Here are the best ways I‚Äôve found.  See [**Music & Sounds**](https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/Cyanomys-Guide-To-Playing-RPGs-Online-v2.0-Ef83ststlhPqW0LELrgye#:uid=724725537463408040872466&h2=Music-&-Sounds) in GM Resources for sources.

| ‚ö† **Warning**: To prevent echo, your players will need to have the music you are streaming to them going through the same device (and same headphones) as the voice or video chat.  Almost every tabletop music streaming method (include those in VTTs) will not work on mobile while simultaneously in with other audio applications running, so they will not work for players who need to use their phone or tablet for video/voice chat while using their laptop for the VTT or character sheet, etc. |

[**Listen Together**](https://support.spotify.com/is/listen_everywhere/gaming/discord/)
On the off chance that everyone at the table has a Spotify premium subcription, this works really well.

**Discord Bots**
If you use Discord server voice chat or a different video call application (such as Zoom) alongside your Discord server during your games, this will work perfectly. If you use discord video calls, you will have to do a workaround. Have your players sign into the discord video call on their *desktop app*, and have them tune in (muted) to the server‚Äôs voice chat on their *browser*. This will soon stop being an issue at all with the coming rollout of [Server Video](https://support.discordapp.com/hc/en-us/articles/360041721052-Server-Video).


- [Neeko](https://top.gg/bot/543771182936358912) ‚Äî this is by far the fanciest discord music bot out there, though it‚Äôs a new project.
- [Groovy](https://groovy.bot/) ‚Äî a simple music bot with really good quality and uptime. If you subscribe to the patreon, you can have multiple Groovy bots in your server, which can be used for layering different music effects (battle music plus rain, for example)
- [Octave](https://top.gg/bot/octave) ‚Äî yet another simple discord music bot.

[**Syrinscape**](https://syrinscape.com/)
If you have the cash to buy the music, Syrinscape is *the* way to go for music. There are *tons* of different soundscapes and music types available for all kinds of games, and you can easily sync the music with your players via their web player.

[**Tabletop Audio**](https://tabletopaudio.com/)
[](https://tabletopaudio.com/)Tabletop Audio has all the music and sound effects you‚Äôll ever need, but you can only beam premade soundboards to your players (not custom boards.) So, if you need a whole new sound scheme during the game (switching from dungeon to forest for example) you‚Äôll have to send your players a link to a new soundboard. üòï

[**Battlebards**](https://battlebards.com/#/deposit)
If you buy their music, you can stream it to your players, and you even get a small amount of storage to upload your own tracks.  The last time I tried this (a couple years ago, mind you) it was buggy as hell and borderline unuseable. I would recommend using Syrinscape instead.

**Simulcast Youtube Videos**
This is kinda janky, but you can simulcast youtube playlists to your players (which they can keep in a background tab) using the following services:

- [Cytu.be](https://cytu.be/) ‚Äî Open source video sharing service with support for playlists. It‚Äôs nicer than watchtogether because it‚Äôs not full of ads, but it‚Äôs old and not the most intuitive.
- [Watch2Gether](https://www.watch2gether.com) ‚Äî You‚Äôll need an adblocker for sure, but it allows you to share youtube playlists real time, for free.

[**Cleanfeed**](https://forum.syrinscape.com/t/another-sound-streaming-option-for-syrinscape-cleanfeed/3160)
This will take some technical setup, but it will allow you to stream *any* music that you can play on your computer to your players in high definition (Youtube Videos, MP3s, Syrinscape, Soundboards, Tabletop Audio, etc‚Ä¶.) 

**Shoutcast**
You can stream internet radio from your computer to your players.  This is complicated, but achieves the same thing as Cleanfeed. The difference is that it transmits at a much lower bitrate, so the stream works better on slow or spotty internet without sounding terrible.


1. Make a free account on [CasterFM](http://www.caster.fm/) free account for streaming link
2. Follow the [directions](https://clients.caster.fm/knowledgebase/1/Broadcast-With-Edcast-Standalone.html) to cast radio from your computer but use [Altacast](https://paper.dropbox.com/ep/redirect/external-link?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.altacast.com%2F&hmac=6Kymkm6%2BmHQR27qB6gpT4S0j5RZG2TzJvjYe3aLErm8%3D) instead of Edcast.
3. Install [VB Audio Cable](https://www.vb-audio.com/Cable/60) to reroute the sound from your music applications (chrome, VLC, Syrinscape, whatever) into Altacast.


## Handouts, Visual Aids, & Collaboration

Sometimes when you‚Äôre playing an RPG you really just need to be able to show a picture to your players, or collaborate using note cards, a whiteboard, etc.  For those circumstances, I recommend using one of these tools:

[**Miro**](https://miro.com/)
Miro (formerly RealTimeBoard) is the *best* free(ish) whiteboard application. It is easy and intuitive to use with lots of different functions (drawing, shapes, sticky notes, upload, chat‚Ä¶) and it *actually works with a digitizer pen* for those of us who have 2-in-1 laptops.  You can only have 3 boards at a time on the free tier ‚Äî however you can export boards when you‚Äôre done, and then delete them to free up space.

[**Zoom Whiteboard**](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/205677665-Sharing-a-whiteboard)
[](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/205677665-Sharing-a-whiteboard)The whiteboard built-in to zoom is pretty crappy, but if you‚Äôre already using zoom and your needs are quite basic, it‚Äôs right there.

[**Google Slides**](https://www.google.com/slides/about/)
[](https://www.google.com/slides/about/)If you prepare and use a lot of visual aids during your games, you might find it really helpful to set up a google slides presentation. You can open the presentation and then screenshare it with your players through your vc application, then just click to the next slide when you need to show them a new picture. You could even integrate sound effects and animations to be extra theatrical.


## Scheduling

[**RPG Schedule Discord Bot**](https://top.gg/bot/531549403086061569)
[](https://top.gg/bot/531549403086061569)This bot makes it super easy to sync up your events and RSVPs with your discord server.

[**When2Meet**](https://www.when2meet.com/)
This simple, free resource makes it actually possible to figure out when your players are available! You‚Äôll never have a conversation like ‚ÄúUhhh tuesday? Nah how bout Wednesday at 3?‚Äù ever again.  

Now, sometimes the hard part is getting your players to actually fill out their schedule on this dead-simple tool.  I recommend sending each of your players the link with a personalized message, and giving them a deadline by which to enter their schedule. Remind them as the deadline is coming up if they haven‚Äôt filled it out yet.  This can motivate most people to do it.

If you get a lot of pushback on filling out the When2Meet, then it might be time to go back to the drawing board on the amount of commitment your players want to put into an RPG, and what they want to get out of it in return.  There‚Äôs nothing wrong with playing a low-commitment pickup RPG every once in a while, but only if everyone is on board with that.

[**Doodle**](https://www.doodle.com/)
Doodle is similar to When2Meet, except it can also connect to Zoom or Google Calendar, and has a slightly more modern user interface. If you want to pay for it you can even get some fancy extra features, like setting a deadline. However, the free option is covered in ads and it can only do specific dates ‚Äî whereas When2Meet can also do general days of the week.

## Looking For Games

It‚Äôs best to look for people to game with who live nearish to you, even if you are socially distancing and must play online.  This way you‚Äôre likely to have a language in common, and also you‚Äôll only need to work with one time zone or a couple time zones that are relatively close together.

# Game-Specific Resources
----------
## Dungeons & Dragons

[**DnD Beyond**](https://www.dndbeyond.com/)
[](https://www.dndbeyond.com/)DDB Does so many things it really needs it‚Äôs own section.  One of these days, it‚Äôs going to grow up and become a full VTT and immediately get moved up into the Big Bois arena.  But for now, you can use it to build and view characters, plan encounters, and reference all your D&D books.

There *are* some sneaky ways to integrate it with other programs though, such as:

- [Beyond 20](https://beyond20.here-for-more.info/) ‚Äî this browser extension can integrate D&D Beyond with Roll20, Foundry VTT, and Discord.
- [Avrae](https://avrae.io/) ‚Äî this Discord bot was bought by DDB and will eventually integrate fully with it.
- [VTTA-dndbeyond](https://www.vttassets.com/assets/vtta-dndbeyond) ‚Äî allows you to import all your purchases from D&D Beyond *into* Foundry

**Other Resources**

- [D&D Resource Compendium](https://www.dnd-compendium.com/)
- [Discord of Many Things](https://discord.gg/JSArr5p)
## Shadowrun
- [SRKit](https://www.reddit.com/r/ShadowrunKit/) is literally a VTT *just for playing shadowrun.* The hilarious thing is that this is actually a really awesome VTT in it‚Äôs own right.
## Fantasy Flight Games
- [RPGSessions](https://rpgsessions.com/) is a character manager and dice roller for FFG Star Wars and Genesys.
## Savage Worlds
- [SWRPG Combat Tracker](http://unholycow.com/swrpg/initiative.html)
- [Savage Bot](https://github.com/alessio29/savagebot) ‚Äî discord bot for dice, cards, bennies, initiative, and more for Savage Worlds

| **v2.0.1**<br>11:56 PM CST <br>April 13, 2020 | **Hotfixes**<br>People pointed out errors. I fixed them. For the most part they were spelling errors but I also made these more significant changes:<br><br>- Foundry has been updated and now works on a normal 15‚Äù laptop screen. I have yet to test it on my husband‚Äôs 13‚Äù 2013 macbook air, but I will report back when I have.<br>- I was a little hard on MapTool the first go round. I realize open source programs are really important to some people, so I made a section specifically for open source projects. However, I‚Äôm frankly unwilling to do the setup required to give MapTool a full review.  It is not an intuitive or easy to use program.<br>- Skype isn‚Äôt *that* bad I guess üôÑ  <br>- Changed my wording about people who want to use Beyond20 to hook DDB to Roll20 or Foundry in ‚Äúis GREAT for‚Äù.  I‚Äôm still not totally convinced it‚Äôs legal yet ‚Äî or at least that it doesn‚Äôt break Roll20 or DDB‚Äôs ToS.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| **v2.1.0**<br>1:55 PM CST<br>April 18, 2020   | **Adding Missing Pieces**<br>Thank you to everyone for your feedback! This update brings some missing resources that you guys have told me about.<br><br>- Added Jitsi, which is way better than Zoom<br>- Added Let‚Äôs Role, which is a healthy competitor for both Astral and Tableplop, and really deserves to be up in the Up & Comers section when I have time.<br>- Added Game Master Engine, which looks like a neat minecraft-for-D&D sort of deal. That‚Äôs actually pretty funny because Minecraft itself was on my original guide. I was thinking about adding Minecraft back in *but* I‚Äôm not sure if I should when there are so many more tailor-made alternatives that also focus on 3D battlemaps (3D Virtual Tabletop, Game Master Engine, Talespire, Tabletop Simulator‚Ä¶)<br>- Moved Syrinscape up into the Sync Music section upon realizing that it now has fully developed functionality for syncing music between players.<br>- Added Doodle as an alternative to When2Meet. It‚Äôs prettier but in most circumstances I would still recommend When2Meet, especially since Doodle doesn‚Äôt have the built-in ability to schedule general days of the week instead of dates.<br>- Added VTTA as another option for D&D Beyond people to use with Foundry<br>- Moved D&D Beyond to it‚Äôs own section in Game-Specific Resources and linked to that section throughout the guide to reduce duplication and confusion.<br>- Added Owlbear Rodeo ‚Äî I was tempted to put this in the ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt make the cut‚Äù section but it‚Äôs so dead-simple to use I decided it would still be useful for tech-averse people who just need to be able to upload a battlemap (it‚Äôs like the opposite of Shmeppy)<br>- Added the entire Handouts, Visual Aids, & Collaboration section for virtual whiteboards and handout sharing.<br>- Filled out the Game-Specific Resources<br>- Added Stuff That Didn‚Äôt Make The Cut<br>- Added a list of free RPGs to the ‚ÄúBroke As Fuck‚Äù quick start section. |

# Stuff That Didn‚Äôt Make The Cut
----------

I‚Äôve come across or been recommended to try more tools than are on this list, but some of them just didn‚Äôt make the cut. Here they are and here‚Äôs why:

- GM Forge ‚Äî the project is dead and the dev will still take your money.
- Mapper VTT ‚Äî it requires the GM to download it and screenshare it via Zoom to players in order to use it, and on top of that it‚Äôs so basic it‚Äôs really not worth using over even something as simple as Schmeppy or Tableplop.
