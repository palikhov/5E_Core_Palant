Weapon Techniques

ABWENDEN
MPP8
Prerequisite: Longsword, Rapier, Saber, Scimitar, Shortsword

A fencing parry, warding off a blow using your own blade. When a creature hits you with a melee weapon and you are not wielding any other weapon or a shield, you can use your reaction to make an attack roll. If the result equals or exceeds the triggering attack roll, the attack misses or, if it is a critical hit, is treated as a normal hit.
If you are smaller than the attacking creature, your attack roll is made at disadvantage.

WHIRLING REBUFF
MPP9
Prerequisite: Greataxe, Halberd, Quarterstaff, Spear, Trident, Any Whip
As a special melee attack, you brandish your weapon to drive opponents away, up to a number of targets equal to your proficiency bonus. Each target must be within 5 feet from you and one other target. A targeted creature must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be pushed 5 feet in a direction of your choice.
Type: Weapon Techniques
THRASH
MPP9
Prerequisite: Flail, Any Whip
You swing your weapon wildly, denying an area to your enemies. In place of a weapon attack, choose a 5-foot square within your weapon's range. Until you have any condition imposed on you, move, attack with it, choose to stop thrashing, or the start of your next turn, any creature that starts in or enters this space for the first time on a turn must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, it takes damage as if you hit it with this weapon.
Type: Weapon Techniques
SUPPRESSING FIRE
MPP9
Prerequisite: Any Bow, Hand or Light Crossbow, Sling
You fire rapidly but inaccurately at an opponent, diverting its attention to you. As an action, expend three pieces of ammunition to force a creature within 30 feet to make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, it has disadvantage on attack rolls that don't target you until the end of its next turn, unless you are more than 30 feet away from it.
Type: Weapon Techniques
SPLIT SHOT
MPP9
Prerequisite: Any Bow, Heavy Crossbow, Sling
Once per turn in place of a ranged attack, you nock two pieces of ammunition and fire them two creatures within 5 feet of each other. Make a ranged attack against each target; if either attack misses, both do. If both attacks hit, you deal your weapon damage to each creature.
Type: Weapon Techniques
SHIELD BASH
MPP9
Prerequisite: Shield
As a special melee attack, you drive an opponent off-balance by smashing through its guard with your shield. The target must succeed on a Strength saving throw or it takes bludgeoning damage equal to your Strength modifier and your next attack roll against it this turn has advantage.
Type: Weapon Techniques
SHATTERING CLOBBER
MPP9
Prerequisite: Any improvised, Club, Greatclub, Quarterstaff
If you are using an improvised weapon that deals bludgeoning damage or a nonmagical weapon listed above, you can use a weapon attack to strike with such force that the weapon breaks. The target must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or takes bludgeoning damage equal to a critical hit with your weapon, which is rendered broken and useless.
Type: Weapon Techniques
PINNING SHOT
MPP9
Prerequisite: Any Bow, Dagger, Dart, Hand axe, Javelin, Heavy or Light Crossbow
As an action, you can attempt to pin a Large or smaller creature that is within normal range of your weapon, sticking it to the ground or other terrain. A creature is unaffected if it is currently flying, swimming, or is immune to being knocked prone. Otherwise, the target must succeed on a Strength or Dexterity saving throw (its choice) or its speed is reduced to 0 until the end of its next turn. As an action on its turn, the creature can pull free and regain its normal speed.
Type: Weapon Techniques
PIERCING STRIKE
MPP9
Prerequisite: Greatsword, Longsword, Morningstar, War Pick
As a special melee attack, you can attempt to penetrate and damage an opponent's heavy or natural armor. The target must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, it takes piercing damage equal to your Strength modifier and its AC is reduced by 1 (maximum 2) until its armor is repaired using an action or, for natural armor, the creature receives regains hit points. This ability is ineffective against magical armor and constructs.
Type: Weapon Techniques
PAIRED WEAPON
MPP9
Prerequisite: Dagger, Sickle, Swordbreaker
While you wield both this weapon and a non-light weapon, you gain a +1 bonus to your AC. Once per turn, you can choose to add 1d4 to the damage roll of your other weapon. When you do so, you lose the bonus to AC until the beginning of your next turn, unless you have the Dual Wielder feat.

Type: Weapon Techniques
LUNGE
MPP9
Prerequisite: Halberd, Lance, Pike, Quarterstaff, Rapier, Spear, Trident
You can use a bonus action to extend in a lunging strike. You gain 5 feet of reach for your next attack on this turn.
Type: Weapon Techniques
IAIJUTSU
MPP9
Prerequisite: Longsword, Rapier, Saber, Scimitar, Shortsword
You draw this weapon from a scabbard or similar device as part of your attack with it, without using an object interaction.
If you have multiple attacks as part of your Attack action, you can make those multiple attacks when you use a readied action, instead of making a single attack.
Type: Weapon Techniques
GRAZING CLOUT
MPP9
Prerequisite: Cestus, Club, Greatclub, Light Hammer, Mace, Sling
When an attack roll with this weapon misses the target's AC by 4 or less, the bludgeon still connects, if not so powerfully. The target takes bludgeoning damage equal to the weapon's damage die
Type: Weapon Techniques
FLEXIBLE FLURRY
MPP9
Prerequisite: Any versatile
The first time you make a one-handed attack with a versatile weapon on your turn, you gain a +1 bonus to your AC until the start of your next turn, unless you are wielding another weapon or wearing a shield.
Type: Weapon Techniques
FINISHER
MPP8
Prerequisite: Battleaxe, Cestus, Club, Dagger, Flail, Greatclub, Mace, Maul, Morningstar, Sickle, Warhammer
When you make a melee attack on a prone or incapacitated creature, you can forgo advantage on an attack roll to attempt to execute it. If your attack roll exceeds the creature's remaining hit points, the target's hit points are reduced to zero. If not, but the attack hits, you deal damage as normal.
Type: Weapon Techniques
ENTANGLE
MPP8
Prerequisite: Net, Any Whip
You can make a disarm, grapple, shove, or trip attack while up to 10 feet from your target by using the extra reach of your weapon. Your reach for the grappled condition when using this weapon is 10 feet instead of 5 feet. If you successfully shove a creature using this weapon, you can choose to either push the target five feet away or pull the target five feet closer.
If you grapple at range, you can't use the weapon to attack or drop the weapon, or the grapple ends. Either combatant can use an action to make an opposed Strength (Athletics) check; the winner can choose to pull the loser up to 5 feet closer. If one creature is larger than the other, it has advantage on its roll.
Type: Weapon Techniques
CRUSHING BLOW
MPP8
Prerequisite: Flail, Light Hammer, Mace, Maul, Warhammer
You can shatter armor with massive swings. Either by using both an action and bonus action, or in place of two weapon attacks, you can make a single attack roll against a heavily- or naturally-armored enemy within reach. On a hit, you deal your normal weapon damage and the target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw. If it fails, its AC is reduced by 2 until the armor is adjusted using an action or, for natural armor, the creature regains hit points. This ability is ineffective against magical armor and constructs.
A creature's AC can't be reduced this way more than once.
Type: Weapon Techniques
CRIPPLING CUT
MPP8
Prerequisite: Battleaxe, Greataxe, Longsword, Saber, Scimitar
As a special melee attack, you aim for a vulnerable limb with a precise strike. The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take slashing damage equal to your weapon's ability modifier and have one form of speed (such as walking or flying) reduced by 10 feet (to a minimum of 0). This effect ends when the creature is healed or spends one turn without using any movement.
Type: Weapon Techniques
CLOSE QUARTERS
MPP8
Prerequisite: Any improvised, Cestus, Dagger, Handaxe, Shortsword
When you successfully grapple or escape a grapple, you can make one weapon attack as a bonus action. When an opponent fails to escape your grapple, you can make a weapon attack as a reaction.
Type: Weapon Techniques
CLEAVE
MPP8
Prerequisite: Any two-handed or versatile slashing
Once on your turn in place of a two-handed melee attack, you can strike at multiple creatures using a single massive swing. Each targeted creature must be within 5 feet of you and one other target, and you can choose a number of targets up to your proficiency bonus.
Each target must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, it takes your weapon's damage roll as damage, using a d4 in place of its usual weapon damage die.
Type: Weapon Techniques
BRACING
MPP8
Prerequisite: Halberd, Lance, Pike, Spear, Trident
You know how to set your weapon to add power to your defensive strikes. When you make a melee attack using a readied action and hit a creature that has moved at least ten feet on this turn, add an additional weapon die to the damage roll and the target must make a Strength saving throw. On a failure, it falls prone and, if mounted, falls from its mount.

Type: Weapon Techniques
BLEEDER
MPP8
Prerequisite: Glaive, Handaxe, Saber, Shortbow, Sickle, Any Whip
When an attack roll with this weapon exceeds the target's AC by 5 or more, or on a critical hit, the weapon inflicts a bleeding wound. At the start of each of its turns, a bleeding creature takes slashing damage equal to your proficiency bonus, ending when it receives magical healing or a creature uses an action to make a DC10 Wisdom (Medicine) check to stop the flow of blood.
A creature can have only one bleeding wound at a time.
Type: Weapon Techniques
ABWENDEN
MPP8
Prerequisite: Longsword, Rapier, Saber, Scimitar, Shortsword
A fencing parry, warding off a blow using your own blade. When a creature hits you with a melee weapon and you are not wielding any other weapon or a shield, you can use your reaction to make an attack roll. If the result equals or exceeds the triggering attack roll, the attack misses or, if it is a critical hit, is treated as a normal hit.
If you are smaller than the attacking creature, your attack roll is made at disadvantage.
Type: Weapon Techniques
Weapon Techniques
MPp7
When a class or feature grants you general proficiency with martial weapons, or you choose the Pact of the Blade, Path of the Kensei, or the Swashbuckler Archetype, you can choose to learn one technique that takes advantage of the properties of a weapon or family of weapons, as given on the table below. You learn one additional weapon technique of your choice each time you gain an Ability Score Improvement, or for each you have previously received.
At your DM's discretion, you can learn a new technique by spending a number of downtime days equal to 10 minus your Intelligence modifier training with an appropriate expert.
When a technique requires a saving throw, the DC is 8 + your weapon attack bonus. A technique can only be used while wielding a weapon in its list, and you must use the technique with a weapon in its list, unless otherwise noted. When a technique deals damage to a creature, you can add any appropriate bonus from your weapon or class features to the damage roll, such as a barbarian's rage bonus or a flame tongue's fire damage, but not an effect that triggers on a hit, such as sneak attack or divine smite.
When a technique is used as a special melee attack, it must replace the attack granted by the Attack action. If you have multiple attacks as part of the Attack action, the technique replaces one of them.
Weapon Techniques Reference Table

Weapon Effects
MPp4
The following optional rules can be used to add extra depth to martial combat, and are inspired by the weapon properties found in The Warrior's Codex Reforged. They can be added as a group or individually to your game.
Called Shotsp4[–]
When you attack with a weapon that you are proficient in, you can forgo adding your proficiency bonus to the attack roll. If the attack hits, you add that proficiency bonus to the damage roll. You must decide to do this before making the attack roll. This ability can be used in conjunction with the Great Weapon Master and Sharpshooter feats.
Cavalry Chargep4[–]
If you damage a creature with a melee weapon that deals piercing damage after moving at least 30 feet straight toward a target while mounted, you deal an extra 1d6 damage.
Finisherp4[–]
When you damage a prone creature with a melee weapon wielded in two hands, you deal an additional d6 damage.
Prone Fightingp4[–]
When you are prone and make a weapon attack with a light weapon, you do not suffer disadvantage for being prone.
Sunderingp4[–]
Many bludgeoning weapons crush, break, or penetrate armor. Once per turn when you attack an object or a target wearing metal armor with a melee weapon that has the heavy property and deals bludgeoning damage, you can gain a +2 bonus to the attack roll.
You can also gain this bonus against creatures with thick shells, metallic hides, and other creatures at the discretion of your DM.

Maneuvers Expanded
MPp12
These combat maneuvers are intended to supplement the ones provided in the PHB for Battlemasters. The Battlemaster Archetype replaces the PHB Combat Superiority feature with the below feature. By taking Specialized Technique (pg. 11) as an alternative to taking a Fighting Style or Combat Stance, Superior Technique grants a measure of Battlemaster prowess to any warrior.
Combat Superiority (Revised)[–]
Replaces Combat Superiority
When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you learn maneuvers that are fueled by special dice called superiority dice. Choose a specialization - Cut-Throat, Mystic Knight, Savage, or Warlord - which you cannot change later, reflecting the style of your battlefield superiority.
When you gain a level, you can replace one stance you know with another one, if you meet its requirements.
Maneuvers. You learn four maneuvers of your choice, which are detailed below, that must be chosen from your specialization or the Combat Maneuvers group. If a maneuver has prerequisites, you must meet the requirements to choose or use it. Many maneuvers enhance an attack in some way; if so, you can use only one maneuver per attack. Other maneuvers replace an attack or action. If such a maneuver requires an attack roll, you can add any magical bonuses from your weapon to the damage roll.
You learn two additional maneuvers of your choice at 7th, 10th, and 15th level. At the end of a long rest, you can replace one maneuver you know with a different eligible one.
Superiority Dice. You have four superiority dice, which are d8s. A superiority die is expended when you use it. You regain all of your expended superiority dice when you finish a short or long rest. You gain another superiority die at 7th and at 15th level.
Saving Throws. Some of your maneuvers require your target to make a saving throw to resist the maneuver's effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:
Maneuver save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength or Dexterity modifier (your choice)
Superior Technique[–]
Replaces Martial Adept
Choose a specialization - Cut-Throat, Mystic Knight, Savage, or Warlord - if you do not have one already. You learn two maneuvers from your chosen specialization or the Combat Maneuvers group, following the rules above except as modified below. If a maneuver has prerequisites, you must meet the requirements to choose or use it.
You gain two superiority dice, which is a d4s (these dice are added to any superiority dice you have from another source) and does not change size as you gain levels.
If you gain this feat or feature again, you learn two additional maneuvers from your specialization or the Combat Maneuvers group, and gain one maneuver die. Your superiority dice from this feature (but not from any other source) increase in size by 2 (e.g. from d4s to d6s), up to a maximum of d12s.
Unless you also have Combat Superiority, you cannot replace maneuvers gained from this feature at the end of a long rest. Instead, when you gain a level, you can replace one maneuver you know with a different eligible maneuver from your specialization or the Combat Maneuvers group.
Ki-Fueled Superiority[–]
Optional 7th-level monk feature
Your focused training has resulted in secret, deadly techniques. You learn two maneuvers of your choice, but do not gain any superiority dice. When you use a maneuver gained from this feature, roll your martial arts die instead of a superiority die. You can't use stunning strike on an attack caused or affected by a maneuver.
You can use these maneuvers a number of times, combined, equal to your Wisdom modifier, and regain all uses when you finish a long rest. While you have no uses available, you can use a maneuver by spending 1 ki point. When you gain a level in this class, you can replace one maneuver granted by this feature with a different eligible one.
Roguish Superiority[–]
Optional 5th level rogue feature
You learn two maneuvers of your choice, which must be triggered by your weapon attack hitting a creature. When you gain a level in this class, you can replace a maneuver you know from this feature with a different eligible one.
When you hit with an attack that is eligible for sneak attack on your turn, you can instead apply a maneuver you know to it. In place of a superiority die, roll your sneak attack dice, but remove the two highest rolls. This counts as a use of sneak attack.
Raging Superiority[–]
Alternative 9th, 13th, 17th level barbarian feature
Your combat style is unrefined but effective. In place of Brutal Critical, you can choose to instead gain the Superior Technique feature.

MANEUVER VARIANTS; ACTION OPTIONS
MPP11
One approach is to transform maneuvers into weaker action options that anyone can take, rather than making a bunch of features that grant access to maneuvers. Here are a few examples:
Goading Attack. 
When you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack with advantage on the attack roll, you can impose disadvantage on the next attack roll the target makes against a creature other than you before the end of your next turn.
Lunging Attack. 
When you make a melee weapon attack roll that doesn't have disadvantage, you can increase your reach for that attack by 5 feet. When you do so, you suffer disadvantage on the attack roll.
Menacing Attack. 
See the Demoralize action option earlier in this document.
Rally. 
See the Bolster action option earlier in this document.
Riposte. 
When a creature misses you with a melee weapon attack with disadvantage on the attack roll, you can use your reaction to make one melee weapon attack against the creature.

WEAPON TECHNIQUES
MATMP4
An orc ducks below a blade then wildly swings his fist at an elf in close combat. A debonair kenku defends himself with a rapier as he deftly strikes a blow. A paladin leaps between her wounded ally and the beholder's disintegrating ray. These are combatants utilizing techniques honed from years of practicing fighting styles.
Once a fighting style is learned, it presents each combatant with an additional option when attacking ordefending in their chosen style.
A practiced combatant learns to use their weapon adeptly, trained to perform a special technique when wielding their chosen weapon. You must be proficient with a weapon to use its technique, and you cannot use a weapon's technique with any other weapon.
If a technique requires a saving throw, the DC of the save is equal to 8 + your Strength or Dexterity Modifier (whichever you used for the attack) + your proficiency bonus.
[–]
The Dungeon Master is encouraged to add techniques to NPCs and creatures that wield weapons. If a technique uses a smaller damage die, instead determine damage by reducing the creature's average weapon damage by 2 - 4.
VARIANT: ADAPTABLE TECHNIQUES
[–]
The Dungeon Master may want to allow players to use many different techniques with the same weapon.

Mithral Weapons
KCAAp134
Mithral is a gleaming, rare form of silver, lighter and stronger than steel. In addition to being used to craft mithral armor, it can also be used to create light, elegant weapons.
Weapons with the thrown property and ammunition have their normal and long ranges doubled when made from mithral. Melee weapons that do not normally have the heavy property gain the finesse property when made from mithral. Melee weapons that do normally have the heavy property do not have it when made from mithral. Finally, mithral weapons count as silver for the purposes of some creatures' resistances or immunities to weapons not made from silver.
The mithral version of a melee weapon or ten pieces of ammunition costs 500 gp more than the normal versions.
Source: KCAA, page 134
FLAMETOUCHED IRON WEAPONS
KCAAP133
Flametouched iron is only found in Thrane and is considered sacred by the Church of the Silver Flame. When freshly mined, the raw iron ore appears to be corroded with rust, but when refined it glimmers with a bluish, silvery sheen.
Fiends and undead abhor the touch of flametouched iron. Attacks made with weapons and ammunition forged of flametouched iron ignore any resistance to bludgeoning, slashing, or piercing damage a fiend or non-deathless undead creature has, and deal half damage to such creatures who have immunity to bludgeoning, slashing, or piercing damage.
The flametouched iron version of a melee weapon or ten pieces of ammunition costs 400 gp more than the normal versions.
