## Elite Kobold

*Swift and lightly armored, the elite are archers, miners, and trap‑makers—educated and quicker than most of their fellow tribesmen.*

***Educated Mine Bosses.*** Elite kobolds are generally the claws of the king, literate, able to work out sums, keen-eyed with a sling stone, and (most of all) loyal to their tribe more than to their clutchmates. **King kobolds** take advantage of their loyalty and put them in charge of planning raids as sergeants and junior chieftains or keeping other kobolds working in the mines.

***Quick Troops.*** In war, elite kobolds fill the roles of slingers, engineers, and massed light infantry. They fight with great devotion, though often with little effect except through weight of numbers or the occasional notable success at undermining enemy walls.

## Icewind Kobold

Kobolds can be found anywhere dragons are known to dwell, and those that live in the mountains and hills of Icewind Dale are among the hardiest of their kind. Drawn to the north by a desire to find and serve white dragons, these kobolds adapted as best they can to the hostile climate. Their sensitive eyes appreciate sunless days and long, dark nights. They use wooden javelins as tools to test the snow ahead of them.

Kobolds native to Icewind Dale frequently wander into Ten-Towns to escape the dreadful cold, hoping to trade what few skills they have for some warm soup and shelter. The people of Ten-Towns, accustomed to the presence of strange outlanders, allow these kobolds to dwell among them for the most part. When the kobolds don't feel safe, they acquire heavy winter clothing and disguise themselves as humans by standing on one another's shoulders. Three kobolds in cold weather gear can pass themselves off as a clumsy human with a successful group Charisma (Deception) check, the DC of which equals the onlooker's Wisdom (Insight) check result.

If the target is a creature or flammable object that isn't being worn or carried, it ignites. Until a creature takes an action to douse the fire, the target takes 3 (1d6) fire damage at the start of each of its turns.

## Junk Shaman

*This short, reptilian humanoid has scales of dull yellow and gleaming copper. It is swathed in filthy robes absolutely festooned with scrap metal, chains, nails, and other bits of metal and wood refuse. It carries a staff made of a length of pipe, topped with a battered candelabra that burns with hissing flames.*

Spindly even for kobolds, junk shamans weigh more than most thanks to the metal bits in which they decorate themselves.

***Fringe Oracles.*** Most other kobolds look at the junk shamans as touched but can't deny that they channel some form of divine energy. A kobold community might openly shun a junk shaman, even while every member of the warren individually seeks the shaman out for wisdom and insight.

***Treasures from Trash.*** A junk shaman eschews the normal, respectable kobold pursuits of mining, trapmaking, and sorcery. Instead, it provides an afterlife of sorts for castoff articles from kobolds and other races alike. It gathers massive collections of broken weapons, useless tools, scrap materials, and other detritus, imbuing the garbage with a semblance of life.

>
>### Reactions
>***Uncanny Dodge.*** The king kobold halves the damage from one attack that hits it. To do so, it must see the attacker.

## King Kobold

*Wrapped in tattered finery and draped in silver and gold jewelry, the king kobold sits on a throne, surrounded by an assortment of grisly traps and weaponry. Its crown, a garish mass of precious metals, adds weight to its boastful decrees.*

***Keen Nose for Politics.*** With considerable guile won by hard experience, a king kobold excels at subterfuge, sustains lucrative trade, and hones a keen eye for potential treachery. The king who rules for more than a few seasons has mastered the art of keeping itself safe through a combination of warriors paid well enough to be loyal, a constant campaign to root out enemies, and an abundance of traps, tricks, and contingencies should things go sour. However, security from threats above and below ground and wealth earned through trade are what truly maintain a king on its throne.

***Eyes Everywhere.*** The condition of its warrens and outlying tribes that pay tribute occupy much of a king kobold's time and energy. Tunnel-runners come and go in a constant stream from warren to warren to keep the king abreast of happenings in all of its holdings. A truly successful king may command fealty from a network of tribes stretching for miles.

***Long Live the King.*** Unlike many tribal kobold chieftains, a king kobold leaves the fighting to its underlings whenever possible, except when doing so might weaken its hold on its territory. Few creatures are as ruthless as a threatened king, and the king will not hesitate to sacrifice everything and everyone to escape and live to fight another day.

## Kobold

Kobolds are craven reptilian humanoids that worship evil dragons as demigods and serve them as minions and toadies. Kobolds inhabit dragons' lairs when they can but more commonly infest dungeons, gathering treasures and trinkets to add to their own tiny hoards.

***Strength in Numbers.***  Kobolds are egg-laying creatures. They mature quickly and can live to be "great wyrms" more than a century old. However, many kobolds perish before they reach the end of their first decade. Physically weak, they are easy prey for predators. This vulnerability forces them to band together. Their superior numbers can win battles against powerful adversaries, but often with massive casualties on the kobold side.

***Tunnelers and Builders.*** Kobolds make up for their physical ineptitude with a cleverness for trap making and tunneling. Their lairs consist of low tunnels through which they move easily but which hinder larger humanoids. Kobolds also riddle their lairs with traps. The most insidious kobold traps make use of natural hazards and other creatures. A trip wire might connect to a spring-loaded trap that hurls clay pots of flesh-eating green slime or flings crates of venomous giant centipedes at intruders.

***The Lost God.*** In addition to the dragons they revere, kobolds worship a lesser god named Kurtulmak. Legends speak of how Kurtulmak served as Tiamat's vassal in the Nine Hells until Garl Glittergold, the god of gnomes, stole a trinket from the Dragon Queen's hoard. Tiamat sent Kurtulmak to retrieve the trinket, but Garl Glittergold played a trick on him, collapsing the earth and trapping the kobold god in an underground maze for eternity. For this reason, kobolds hate gnomes and pranks of any kind. Kurtulmak's most devoted worshipers dedicate themselves to finding and releasing their lost god from his prison-maze.

## Kobold

[https://angrygolem-games.com/monster-tactics-fight-like-a-kobold/](KOBOLD's TACTICS (read the article))

DESCRIPTION

Kobolds are a cowardly, sadistic race of short humanoids that vigorously contest the human and demi-human races for living space and food. They especially dislike gnomes and attack them on sight.

Barely clearing 3 feet in height, kobolds have scaly hides that range from dark, rusty brown to a rusty black. They smell of damp dogs and stagnant water. Their eyes glow like a bright red spark and they have two small horns ranging from tan to white.

Because of the kobolds' fondness for wearing raggedy garb of red and orange, their non-prehensile rat-like tails, and their language (which sounds like small dogs yapping), these fell creatures are often not taken seriously. This is often a fatal mistake, for what they lack in size and strength they make up in ferocity and

tenacity.

Kobolds speak their own language; some (75%) speak orc and goblin.

HABITAT / SOCIETY

Kobolds live in dark, damp places underground and in overgrown forests. They can be found in almost any climate. As kobolds are good miners, any area with potential for mining is fair game for settlement.

The average kobold tribe has 40 – 400 (4d10x10) adult males. For every 40 kobolds in a band there will be one leader and two bodyguards. In a lair there will be 5-20 (5d4) bodyguards, females equal to 50% of the males, young equal to 10% of the males and 30-300 (3d10x10) eggs. There will also be a chief and 2-8 guards.

Further, there is a 65% chance there will be guard animals: (70%) 2-5 wild boars or (30%) 1-4 giant weasels. There may be one or more shamans.

Their society is tribal but can be further broken up into war bands based on specific clans. As many as 10 families can be part of a clan, and each clan usually is responsible for controlling the area in a 10 mile radius from the lair.

Kobolds recover treasure from the bodies of their victims and often carry them back to their lair as food. In some instances, kobolds will not kill their victims, but will sell them as slaves. Kobolds are distrustful of strangers.

They hate brownies, pixies, sprites and gnomes. Gnomes are never eaten or taken prisoner.

ECOLOGY

Perhaps kobolds are so cruel because they are easy prey for larger humanoids and hungry monsters. They have many enemies, and even the dwarves have had to admit that the numerous kobold-goblin wars have kept the number of goblins down to a safe level. Kobolds can live 135 years.

## Kobold Air Cavalry

Kobolds come in many shapes and sizes, many of which have been detailed in other publications. There are a few kobold groups, however, that seem to have flown under the radar of those who study their culture and habitat. The following is a detailed study of one such group within the kobold society.

**Kobold Air Cavalry**. Kobold's adoration of dragons is as ancient as the origin of Kurtulmak, and kobolds are known to provide service, and worship, to dragon kind. Occasionally a dragon may see fit to reward a tribe of kobolds with a momentous boon–a clutch of kobold/dragon hybrid eggs. Strong and agile winged kobolds with breath weapons are the result.

Instead of poison damage, the kobold can deal the damage type currently in effect for its Apothecary trait.

## Kobold Alchemist

*This slight, reptilian humanoid is bedecked with ceramic flasks and glass vials. An acrid reek follows in the creature's wake.*

Kobold alchemists are usually smelled before they are seen, thanks to the apothecary's store of chemicals and poisons they carry. Alchemists often sport mottled and discolored scales and skin, caused by the caustic nature of their obsessions. They raid alchemy shops and magical laboratories to gather more material to fuel their reckless experiments.

***Dangerous Assets.*** Alchemists can be a great boon to their clan, but at a cost. Not only do the alchemists require rare, expensive, and often dangerous substances to ply their trade, they tend to be a little unhinged. Their experiments yield powerful weapons and defensive concoctions that can save many kobold lives, but the destruction caused by an experiment gone awry can be terrible.

## Kobold Chieftain

*This small, draconic humanoid struts as though it were ten feet tall. It wears the gilded skull of a small dragon as a helmet, and its beady eyes gleam out through the skull's sockets. It hefts its spear and shield and lets out a blood-curdling shriek, signaling the attack.*

While most kobolds are scuttling scavengers or pathetic sycophants, a few carry a spark of draconic nobility that can't be ignored. These few forge their tribes into forces to be reckoned with, rising to the rank of chieftain. A kobold chieftain stands proud, clad in war gear of fine quality and good repair. Their weapons are tended by the tribe's trapsmiths, particularly evident in their springspike shields.

***Living Legend.*** A kobold chieftain is more than a leader, it is a symbol of the tribe's greatness. The strongest, most cunning, most ruthless of a kobold tribe embodies their connection to the revered dragons. When a chieftain sounds the call to battle, the kobolds meld into a fearless, deadly force.

## Kobold Dragonshield

A kobold dragonshield is a champion of its race. Almost all dragonshields begin life as normal kobolds, then are chosen by a dragon and invested with great powers for the purpose of protecting the dragon's eggs, but once every few years a kobold hatches with an innate version of the dragonshield's abilities. Accomplished at hand-to-hand combat, it bears many scars from desperate fights and carries a shield made out of cast-off dragon scales.

***Uncommon Courage.***  A dragonshield knows that it has a place of honor in the tribe, but-being kobolds at heart-most of them feel unworthy of their status and thus desperate to prove themselves deserving of it. A dragonshield's natural kobold cowardice is still present in its makeup, and thus it might still run away from a threat. But it also has the ability to rally in the face of certain death, inspiring other kobolds to follow it in a charge against the invaders of their warren.

>- **1. Acid** The kobold hurls a flask of *acid*. *Ranged Weapon Attack:* +4 to hit, range 5/20 ft., one target. *Hit:* 7 (2d6) acid damage.
>- **2. Alchemist's fire** The kobold throws a flask of *alchemist's fire*. *Ranged Weapon Attack:* +4 to hit, range 5/20 ft., one target. *Hit:* 2 (1d4) fire damage at the start of each of the target's turns. A creature can end this damage by using its action to make a DC 10 Dexterity check to extinguish the flames.
>- **3. Basket of Centipedes** The kobold throws a small basket into a 5-foot-square space within 20 feet of it. A **swarm of insects (centipedes)** with 11 hit points emerges from the basket and rolls initiative. At the end of each of the swarm's turns, there's a 50 percent chance that the swarm disperses.
>- **4. Green Slime Pot** The kobold throws a clay pot full of green slime at the target, and it breaks open on impact. *Ranged Weapon Attack:* +4 to hit, range 5/20 ft., one target. *Hit:* The target is covered in a patch of green slime (see chapter 5 of the Dungeon Master's Guide). Miss: A patch of green slime covers a randomly determined 5-foot-square section of wall or floor within 5 feet of the target.
>- **5. Rot Grub Pot** The kobold throws a clay pot into a 5-foot-square space within 20 feet of it, and it breaks open on impact. A **swarm of rot grubs** (see appendix A) emerges from the shattered pot and remains a hazard in that square.

Scorpion on a Stick** The kobold makes a melee attack with a scorpion tied to the end of a 5-foot-long pole. *Melee Weapon Attack:* +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 1 piercing damage, and the target must make a DC 9 Constitution saving throw, taking 4 (1d8) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
>- **7. Skunk in a Cage** The kobold releases a skunk into an unoccupied space within 5 feet of it. The skunk has a walking speed of 20 feet, AC 10, 1 hit point, and no effective attacks. It rolls initiative and, on its turn, uses its action to spray musk at a random creature within 5 feet of it. The target must make a DC 9 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target retches and can't take actions for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. A creature that doesn't need to breathe or is immune to poison automatically succeeds on the saving throw. Once the skunk has sprayed its musk, it can't do so again until it finishes a short or long rest.
>- **8. Wasp Nest in a Bag** The kobold throws a small bag into a 5-foot-square space within 20 feet of it. A **swarm of insects (wasps)** with 11 hit points emerges from the bag and rolls initiative. At the end of each of the swarm's turns, there's a 50 percent chance that the swarm disperses.

## Kobold Inventor

A kobold inventor, crafty and with quick hands, builds improvised weapons in the hope of gaining some new advantage in combat. An inventor captures bugs, scoops up exotic dungeon slimes, and claims the best stolen goods as ingredients in its experiments. Its creations are sometimes comical in appearance, but-like kobolds' traps-they work a lot better than their materials would suggest.

***Good While They Last.***  An inventor's new weapons last for only one or two attacks before they break, but might be surprisingly effective in the meantime. Most inventors are skilled enough that their improvised weapons don't backfire on them, but other users might not be so lucky. The weapons don't have to be lethal-in many cases one serves its purpose if it distracts, scares, or confuses a creature long enough for other kobolds to kill the enemy. In any particular encounter, an inventor usually has one or two improvised weapons at its disposal.

## Kobold Scale Sorcerer

A kobold scale sorcerer has an innate talent for arcane magic, making it a highly valuable member of the tribe for several reasons. Because the kobolds' deity remains imprisoned, most tribes lack individuals that can use divine magic, and so the scale sorcerers fill the roles of advisor and historian. In times of peace, they use their spells to fortify and enhance the warren and aid the rest of the tribe. When the tribe is threatened, a scale sorcerer lashes out with fire and poison against enemies, saving a bit of magic for itself in case it needs to flee or take advantage of a captor.

***Duty-Bound to a Dragon.***  In a kobold tribe associated with a dragon, typically one that resides in or near the dragon's lair, the scale sorcerer also serves as diplomat and mouthpiece-anticipating the dragon's needs, issuing commands to other kobolds on the dragon's behalf, and reporting information back to the dragon. The sorcerer is just as awed by and respectful of dragons as common kobolds are, but it knows that its duty requires it not to fawn over its master at all times. It also understands that its frequent proximity to the dragon means it would probably be the first to die if its master became angry or displeased, and so it frantically maintains a balance between adoration and terror in its behavior toward the dragon.

Never make the mistake of thinking kobolds are stupid or backward just because they're small. Size has nothing to do with it.

## Kobold Scale Sorcerer

Kobold scale sorcerers have an innate talent for arcane magic, making them highly valuable members of their communities. These sorcerers typically fill the role of advisor, and when threatened, a scale sorcerer lashes out with colorful magic.

A scale sorcerer who resides in or near a dragon's lair may serve as that dragon's diplomat and mouthpiece—anticipating the dragon's needs, issuing commands to others on the dragon's behalf, and reporting information back to the dragon. Such scale sorcerers often wear artificial wings, which are a sign of their draconic office. Scale sorcerers are just as awed by and respectful of dragons as others who venerate these mighty creatures, but they know that duty requires them not to fawn over their master at all times. They also understand that their frequent proximity to their dragon master means they would probably be the first to die if their master became angry or displeased, so they frantically maintain a balance between adoration and terror in their behavior toward their master.

## Kobold Scale Sorcerer

[https://angrygolem-games.com/monster-manual/letter-k/kobold-scale-sorcerer-5e-stats/](Kobold Scale Sorcerer)

DESCRIPTION

A kobold scale sorcerer has an innate talent for arcane magic, making it a highly valuable member of the tribe for several reasons. Because the kobolds' deity remains imprisoned, most tribes lack individuals that can use divine magic, and so the scale sorcerers fill the roles of advisor and historian. In times of peace, they use their spells to fortify and enhance the warren and aid the rest of the tribe. When the tribe is threatened, a scale sorcerer lashes out with fire and poison against enemies, saving a bit of magic for itself in case it needs to flee or take advantage of a captor.

## Kobold Spellclerk

*The reptilian snout peeking out from a deep hood is the only hint that this cloaked figure is a kobold. A fang charm dangling from its neck, the kobold goes about its business of secrets and whispers.****Agents of the Empire.*** Kobold spellclerks work primarily as messengers and agents of the Dragon Empire's spy network. They are skilled in code writing and breaking, overseeing the operations of other field agents, and providing their overlords a valued glimpse into the internal affairs of their enemies.

***Trusted Messengers.*** Kobold spellclerks are often granted the use of magic items that aid in encryption and message-sending to supplement their natural skills and magical studies. The messages they carry or compose are often of great import to clandestine activities.

> ##### Kobold Spellclerks in Midgard
>The spellclerks operate as the lowest rank of spy in the Mharoti Empire's spy network, which is jointly administered by Parsis the Hidden and Kah Vizier Zeki Hasan Al Eski. In spite of their lower status, they are no less important to the spy network and make up the majority of Mharoti's spies abroad. At home, spellclerks are treated with a mixture of respect and wariness, as the spies are used just as often within the empire to root out those who chafe under dragon rule.
>
>Kobold spellclerks in Midgard typically prepare *dragon roar* in place of *fire bolt* and *converse with dragon* in place of *feather fall*. Both spells can be found in *Deep Magic for 5th Edition*.

If it is a surface, the trap can cover an area of the surface no larger than 10 feet in diameter.  
>The trap is hidden, requiring a DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) to find it or a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check to spot it.  
>For traps placed on a surface, the trap is triggered when a surface within the area is touched or stepped on, removing another object covering it, or manipulating an object that holds it. For traps within an object, the trap is triggered when the object is opened or manipulated.

>
>***5.*** Stink Cloud. The trap creates a 10-foot radius sphere of green, nauseating gas centered on the trap which lasts for 1 minute. The sphere spreads around corners, and its area is heavily obscured. Each target within the cloud must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw against poison. On a failed save, the creature spends its action that turn retching and reeling. Creatures that don't need to breathe or are immune to poison automatically succeed on this saving throw. A moderate wind (at least 10 miles per hour) disperses the cloud after 4 rounds. A strong wind (at least 20 miles per hour) disperses it after 1 round.

>***Thief's Tools.*** The kobold trapsmith has proficiency with *thief's tools* and is seldom without them. If its tools are taken away or lost, it can cobble together a new set from wire, bits of metal, and other junk in 30 minutes.  
>
>***Traps and Snares.*** The kobold trapsmith excels at setting mechanical traps. Detecting, disarming, avoiding, or mitigating its traps require successful DC 13 checks or saving throws, and the traps have +5 attack bonuses. With *thief's tools* and basic construction materials, a trapsmith can set up one of the simple but effective traps listed below in 5 minutes. Triggers involve pressure plates, tripwires, small catches in a lock, or other simple mechanisms.  
>- **Choke Bomb.** This small incendiary device burns rapidly and releases choking smoke in a 20-foot sphere. The area is heavily obscured. Any breathing creature that's in the affected area when the cloud is created or that starts its turn in the cloud is poisoned. Once a poisoned creature leaves the cloud, it makes a DC 13 Constitution saving throw at the end of its turns, ending the poisoned condition on a success. The smoke dissipates after 10 minutes, or after 1 round in a strong wind.
>- **Poisoned Sliver.** A poisoned sliver or needle can be hidden almost anywhere: inside a lock or a box, in a carpeted floor, on the underside of a door handle, in a cup of liquid or a bowl of gems. When someone meets the conditions for being jabbed by the sliver, the trap makes a melee weapon attack with advantage: +5 to hit, reach 0 ft., one target; *Hit:* 2 (1d4) piercing damage plus 14 (4d6) poison damage, or one-half poison damage with a successful DC 13 Constitution saving throw.
>- **Skullpopper.** This trap consists of either a heavy weight, a spike, or a blade, set to fall or swing into a victim. When triggered, a skullpopper makes a melee weapon attack against the first target in its path: +5 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target; *Hit:* 11 (2d10) damage. The type of damage depends on how the skullpopper is built: a stone or heavy log does bludgeoning damage, a spiked log does piercing damage, a scything blade does slashing damage, etc.
>- **Slingsnare.** A concealed loop of rope or wire is affixed to a counterweight. When a creature steps into the snare, it must make a successful DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or be yanked into the air and suspended, upside down, 5 feet above the ground. The snared creature is restrained (escape DC 13). The cord is AC 10 and has 5 hit points.
>
>
>### Actions
>***Dagger.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 5 (1d4 + 3) piercing damage.  
>
>***Light Crossbow.*** *Ranged Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, range 80/320 ft., one target. *Hit:* 7 (1d8 + 3) piercing damage plus 7 (2d6) poison damage, or one-half poison damage with a successful DC 13 Constitution saving throw.  
>
>***Shredder (Recharge 6).*** The kobold trapsmith primes and throws a device at a point within 30 feet. The device explodes when it hits something solid, flinging razor-sharp spikes in a 15-foot-radius sphere. Every creature in the area takes 14 (4d6) piercing damage, or half damage with a successful DC 13 Dexterity saving throw. The ground inside the spherical area is littered with spikes; it becomes difficult terrain, and a creature that falls prone in the area takes 7 (2d6) piercing damage.

>***Stunner (1/Day).*** *Ranged Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, range 20/60 ft., one target. *Hit:* 5 (1d4 + 3) bludgeoning damage, and the target is restrained (escape DC 13). While restrained, the target takes 7 (2d6) lightning damage at the start of its turn and falls prone. The trapsmith has advantage on the attack roll if the target is wearing metal armor. A stunner is a bola made of metal wire, magnets, and static electricity capacitors. A kobold trapsmith can recharge it during a long rest.

## Kobold Trapsmith

*This kobold is bedecked in satchels, pouches, sacks, and bandoliers. All of these are bursting with tools, bits of scrap, wire, cogs and twine. Impossibly large eyes blink through the lenses of its goggles.*

Some kobolds hatch a bit cleverer than their counterparts. These sharp-witted creatures feel driven to fiddle with the world, and those that don't meet an early demise through accident or violence often take up tinkering. Trapsmiths make a kobold lair into a deadly gauntlet of hidden pain.

> ##### Shifting Peril
>Trapsmiths aren't warriors; they avoid direct confrontation with enemies that aren't mired in traps or engaged with other foes. If the trapsmith senses that invaders in its lair are likely to get past its traps, it tries to hide or escape.
>
>A trapsmith delights in laying traps and snares behind invaders, along tunnels and paths they've already cleared and believe to be safe, then luring them back through its handiwork.
>

> ##### Trapsmith Needs Traps!
>The trapsmith falls between CR ½ and 1, depending on how many traps PCs fall into before they corner him. For 1 or 2 traps, assume CR ½. For 4 or more, use CR 1. Make sure to put the trapsmith to work!

## Kobold War Machine

*A fire burns in the maw of the massive, draconic machine. The frenetic cackling of kobolds yelling orders to one another echoes from the interior, rising above the sounds of the machine's engines.*Inspired by the sight of a fearsome **clockwork dragon** ([Creature Codex](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/master/collection/Kobold Press; Creature Codex.json)), some kobolds with an understanding of engineering came together and forged their own dragon-like weapon of great power. Kobolds feel unstoppable when a war machine rolls along beside them, leading them to take bolder (and often more successful), risks.

***Hard to Operate.*** The kobold war machine is normally manned by three kobolds. Though the machine is a marvel of kobold engineering, it is difficult to control, and its smooth operation is impaired by the contanct bickering of its crew just as often as by it unstable construction.

***Draconic Machine.*** By some quirk of its creation, the kobold war machine exhibits some draconic personality traits. It moves better when diving into a fight or when pursuing treasure, and it rarely has issues when handled by an operator who regularly praises it in front of others. Conversely, it is slow to respond when directed to retreat.

***Construct Nature.*** The kobold war machine doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.

## Swolbold

*From behind the collection of angry kobolds steps a creature the size of a dwarf, its bulging muscles flexing as its kobold-like snout twists into a terrible grin.*

***A Beast Among Kobolds.*** The swolbold is the brute of the kobold world, a hulking specimen among its smaller and more fragile cousins. Roughly the height of a dwarf but much wider, the rippling muscles of the swolbold betray its ferocious strength. In contrast to the sneakiness and cunning of the kobold, the swolbold is straightforward and devastating in combat.

***Bred for Destruction.*** Swolbolds are very rare, and their penchant for unthinking destruction has stumped sages. Some theorize that swolbolds have been bred by evil wizards in arcane experiments gone horribly wrong. Others state the dark gods revered by kobolds gift these monsters to tribes particularly fervent in their worship. Others still conclude that carefully crafted alchemy transformed normal kobolds into these beastly creatures. Regardless of the swolbold's origins, experts agree on one thing: you don't want to meet a swolbold in a dark, subterranean lair.

***Fighting Style.*** The physiognomy of the swolbold allows them to shrug off most mundane blows. Their preferred fighting style is to crush the life out of their foes, rather than stabbing and scuttling like their smaller cousins. Their girth makes fitting into normal armor difficult, so their tribal leaders often create piecemeal armor for them: scraps of metal plates held over vital areas with bits of leather or rope.

One or two swolbolds may accompany a larger force of kobolds, acting at the vanguard of an attack. The larger creatures act as battering rams and moving shields, allowing the smaller kobolds to use their ranged attacks and devious tactics to the greatest effect.

*A brawny looking kobold brandishes a manticore spike driven through its scaled hand.*

***Leaders.*** The barbed are physically stronger than their brethren and bear the scars of living close to manticores. They are devoted to Mantik and believe he is a divine being who will lead them to victory over the drakes of the waste and the dragons of the mountains.

***Marked.*** The barbed are known by the large tail spike (from Mantik himself) driven through their wrist and hand. They are immune to the poison that still seeps from the spike.

## Winged Kobold

Kobolds are craven reptilian humanoids that worship evil dragons as demigods and serve them as minions and toadies. Kobolds inhabit dragons' lairs when they can but more commonly infest dungeons, gathering treasures and trinkets to add to their own tiny hoards.

***Strength in Numbers.***  Kobolds are egg-laying creatures. They mature quickly and can live to be "great wyrms" more than a century old. However, many kobolds perish before they reach the end of their first decade. Physically weak, they are easy prey for predators. This vulnerability forces them to band together. Their superior numbers can win battles against powerful adversaries, but often with massive casualties on the kobold side.

***Tunnelers and Builders.*** Kobolds make up for their physical ineptitude with a cleverness for trap making and tunneling. Their lairs consist of low tunnels through which they move easily but which hinder larger humanoids. Kobolds also riddle their lairs with traps. The most insidious kobold traps make use of natural hazards and other creatures. A trip wire might connect to a spring-loaded trap that hurls clay pots of flesh-eating green slime or flings crates of venomous giant centipedes at intruders.

***The Lost God.*** In addition to the dragons they revere, kobolds worship a lesser god named Kurtulmak. Legends speak of how Kurtulmak served as Tiamat's vassal in the Nine Hells until Garl Glittergold, the god of gnomes, stole a trinket from the Dragon Queen's hoard. Tiamat sent Kurtulmak to retrieve the trinket, but Garl Glittergold played a trick on him, collapsing the earth and trapping the kobold god in an underground maze for eternity. For this reason, kobolds hate gnomes and pranks of any kind. Kurtulmak's most devoted worshipers dedicate themselves to finding and releasing their lost god from his prison-maze.

>***Draconic Visage (1/Day).*** The wizard kobold magically creates a draconic visage in an unoccupied space it can see within 30 feet. The visage is a glowing, spectral head and neck, resembling a variety of dragon chosen by the kobold, that sheds dim light out to 10 feet. The visage lasts for 1 minute and grants the following benefits:  
>- A creature hostile to the wizard who starts its turn within 30 feet of the visage and who is aware of the visage must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to this effect for the next 24 hours.
>- The wizard gains immunity to the damage type dealt by the chosen dragon's breath weapon.
>- When the wizard uses this action, and as a bonus action on it subsequent turns, it can use the following attack:  
  - **Breath of the Visage.** *Ranged Spell Attack:* +6 to hit, range 120 ft., one target. *Hit:* 7 (2d6) damage of the type dealt by the chosen dragon's breath weapon.

## Wizard Kobold

*An aura of power, centered on a glowing purple crystal atop a short staff, crackles around this pale kobold and arcs across the horns on its headdress. A luminous, leering dragon face fades into being, ghostly and terrible, behind it.*

Wizard kobolds are among the most cunning and intelligent of the scaly kin. They turn their talent for manipulating arcane magic to study and formula, often getting their start with a stolen spellbook, or one purloined from the remains of an adventurer who met its end in a kobold trap.

***Draconic Channel.*** Wizard kobolds have made a fearsome reputation for themselves with their ability to tap into their draconic heritage through their magic. The wizard draws magic either from a patron dragon or an ancestral dragon figure, manifesting it as a magical effigy. This apparition lends its resilience to the wizard and brings terror and death to the kobold's enemies.

## Yusdrayl

Kobolds are craven reptilian humanoids that worship evil dragons as demigods and serve them as minions and toadies. Kobolds inhabit dragons' lairs when they can but more commonly infest dungeons, gathering treasures and trinkets to add to their own tiny hoards.

***Strength in Numbers.***  Kobolds are egg-laying creatures. They mature quickly and can live to be "great wyrms" more than a century old. However, many kobolds perish before they reach the end of their first decade. Physically weak, they are easy prey for predators. This vulnerability forces them to band together. Their superior numbers can win battles against powerful adversaries, but often with massive casualties on the kobold side.

***Tunnelers and Builders.*** Kobolds make up for their physical ineptitude with a cleverness for trap making and tunneling. Their lairs consist of low tunnels through which they move easily but which hinder larger humanoids. Kobolds also riddle their lairs with traps. The most insidious kobold traps make use of natural hazards and other creatures. A trip wire might connect to a spring-loaded trap that hurls clay pots of flesh-eating green slime or flings crates of venomous giant centipedes at intruders.

***The Lost God.*** In addition to the dragons they revere, kobolds worship a lesser god named Kurtulmak. Legends speak of how Kurtulmak served as Tiamat's vassal in the Nine Hells until Garl Glittergold, the god of gnomes, stole a trinket from the Dragon Queen's hoard. Tiamat sent Kurtulmak to retrieve the trinket, but Garl Glittergold played a trick on him, collapsing the earth and trapping the kobold god in an underground maze for eternity. For this reason, kobolds hate gnomes and pranks of any kind. Kurtulmak's most devoted worshipers dedicate themselves to finding and releasing their lost god from his prison-maze.
