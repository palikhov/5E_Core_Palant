>___
>***Cunning Action.*** Starting at 2nd level, your quick thinking and agility allow you to move and act quickly. You can take a bonus action on each of your turns in combat. This action can be used only to take the Dash,  Disengage, or  Hide action.  
>
>***Decipher Script.*** You can decipher writing in an unfamiliar language or a message written in an incomplete or archaic form. The base DC is 20 for the simplest messages, 25 for standard texts, and 30 or higher for intricate, exotic, or very old writing.  
>If the check succeeds, you understand the general content of a piece of writing about one page long (or the equivalent). If the check fails, make a DC 5 Wisdom check to see if you avoid drawing a false conclusion about the text. (Success means that you do not draw a false conclusion; failure means that you do.)  
>Both the Decipher Script check and (if necessary) the Wisdom check are made secretly, so that you can't tell whether the conclusion you draw is true or false.  
>
>***Evasion.*** Beginning at 7th level, you can nimbly dodge out of the way of certain area Effects, such as a red dragon's fiery breath or an Ice Storm spell. When you are subjected to an Effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.  
>
>***Fast Hands.*** Starting at 3rd Level, you can use the Bonus Action granted by your Cunning Action to make a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check, use your thieves' tools to Disarm a trap or open a lock, or take the Use an Object action.  
>
>***Sneak Attack (3d6).*** Beginning at 1st level, you know how to strike subtly and exploit a foe's distraction. Once per turn, you can deal an extra 3d6 damage to one creature you hit with an attack if you have advantage on the attack roll. The attack must use a finesse or a ranged weapon.  
>You don't need advantage on the attack roll if another enemy of the target is within 5 feet of it, that enemy isn't incapacitated, and you don't have disadvantage on the attack roll.  
>The amount of the extra damage increases as you gain levels in this class, as shown in the Sneak Attack column of the Rogue table.  
>
>***Thievery.*** You have picked up thieving abilities and can perform tasks that require nerves of steel and a steady hand: disabling traps, opening locks, picking pockets, and sleight of hand. The DM might decide that some uses of this skill are so specialized that you are required to be trained in it to have a chance of succeeding.  
>
>***Two Weapon Fighting.*** When you take the Attack action and Attack with a light melee weapon that you're holding in one hand, you can use a Bonus Action to Attack with a different light melee weapon that you're holding in the other hand. You don't add your ability modifier to the damage of the bonus Attack, unless that modifier is negative.  
>If either weapon has the Thrown property, you can throw the weapon, instead of making a melee Attack with it.  
>
>***Uncanny Dodge.*** Starting at 5th Level, when an attacker that you can see hits you with an Attack, you can use your Reaction to halve the attack's damage against you.  
>
>### Actions
>***Gleemer (Scimitar +2).*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 10 (1d6 + 7) slashing damage.  
>
>***Slicer (Dagger +2).*** *Melee  or Ranged Weapon Attack:* +10 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target. *Hit:* 9 (1d4 + 7) slashing damage in melee, or 9 (1d4 + 7) slashing damage at range.  
>
>***Throwing Dagger.*** *Ranged Weapon Attack:* +10 to hit, range 10/50 ft., one target. *Hit:* 12 (1d8 + 7) piercing damage.

>***Aura of Antipathy.*** The Enchantment causes creatures of the kind you designated to feel an intense urge to leave the area and avoid the target. When such a creature can see the target or comes within 60 feet of it, the creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become Frightened. The creature remains frigh⁠tened while it can see the target or is within 60 feet of it. While frig⁠htened by the target, the creature must use its Movement to move to the nearest safe spot from which it can't see the target. If the creature moves more than 60 feet from the target and can't see it, the creature is no longer fright⁠ened, but the creature becomes fright⁠ened again if it regains sight of the target or moves within 60 feet of it.  
>
>***Instinctive Charm.*** Beginning at 5th level, when a creature that you can see attacks you from within 50 feet of you, you can use your reaction to magically compel the attacker to direct its attack elsewhere. You must choose to use this feature before knowing whether the attack hits or misses. If you use it, the attacker must make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC. A creature that cannot be charmed automatically succeeds. On a failed save, the attacker must target the creature other than you that is closest to it. If multiple creatures are closest, the attacker chooses which one to target. The attack is wasted if no eligible targets are within range.

## Drow

# Drow
Tens of thousands of years ago, the elves were divided, with those of benevolent disposition battling those that were selfish and cruel. The war among elvenkind ended when the good elves banished their malevolent kin to the subterranean depths. Here, in the lightless caverns and endless warrens of twisting passages, the dark elves-the drow-found refuge. They also found leadership in the only elven deity who had not forsaken them. At her command, the dark elves built an empire in the underworld.

***Children of Lolth.*** The drow worship Lolth, a deity who resides in the Abyss. Known as the Spider Queen or the Demon Queen of Spiders, she is the figure around which the dark elves have built their subterranean civilization. Whatever she demands, the drow do. The wickedest of elves, drow are seldom seen by the surface world. Though they plot to destroy the elves that banished them, they no longer see themselves as exiles. They are the destined rulers of the darkness, and when Lolth commands them to rise up and destroy their surface-dwelling kin, they will.

***Creatures of Darkness.*** The drow have lived underground for so long that they have evolved to their surroundings and can see in the dark. However, they can no longer stand sunlight. When slaves are in short supply in the Underdark, the drow send raiding parties to the surface to capture humanoids under cover of darkness, bringing them back to their cities to be tortured into submission. Beyond those occasional excursions, the drow are content to remain in their subterranean realm, where they feel secure and in control.

***Underdark Cities.*** The dark elves build fantastic cities in enormous caverns where food and water are abundant. Their ability to sculpt stone rivals that of the greatest dwarf artisans, yet their structures retain a decidedly elven aesthetic. Though appearing delicate, drow settlements are structurally sound and remarkably resilient. The drow like to hollow out enormous stalagmites and stalactites, creating populated spires that rise from the floors and ceilings. A drow city is a sprawling metropolis enclosed by high walls. Non-drow visitors must conduct their business outside the walls under watchful eyes. The drow raise and keep giant spiders to help protect their cities against intruders, even as they drape those cities in beautiful webbing, creating a gossamer snare to catch flying enemies that would otherwise soar over the walls.

***Drow Magic.*** Just as the drow have adapted to underground life, so too has their magic. In addition to using that magic to carve their cities from stone, they empower their weapons, create dangerous new magic items, and summon demons from the Abyss. Drow spellcasters are supremely arrogant and never hesitate to use their magic in the most abhorrent ways.

***Arms and Armor.*** Drow craft weapons made of adamantine, a dark and supernaturally hard metal. Drow artisans adorn their weapons and armor with web-like filigree and spider motifs, and mages sometimes imbue items with magic to enhance their effectiveness. However, such magic fades when exposed to sunlight, so that magical drow weapons and armor rarely retain their enhancement bonuses and magical properties when brought to the surface.

***Cutthroat Politics.*** Drow politics are cutthroat and rife with intrigue. When drow work together, it is typically to destroy a common foe and ensure their own survival, and such alliances are short lived and fraught with peril.

Drow society is divided into noble houses, each ruled by a matron who seeks to raise the prestige and power of her house above all others. Other high-ranking members of the house are blood relatives, while the middling ranks are flush with drow from weaker families that have sworn fealty to the greater house. Clinging precariously to the bottom rung of a house's social ladder are the house slaves, made up of drow of low birth and the occasional non-drow captive.

***Matriarchal Rule.*** Lolth, through her faithful priestesses, dictates the rules of drow society, ensuring that her orders and plots are carried out. Since Lolth is prone to manifesting on the Material Plane and directly punishing those that disobey her, the drow have learned to heed what she says and do as her priestesses command.

In drow society, males are subservient to females. A male drow might lead an Underdark patrol or a raiding party to the surface, but he reports to a female drow-either the matron of his house or one of her hand-picked female subordinates. Although male drow can fill almost any function in drow society, they can't be priests, nor can they rule a house.

***Poison Predilection.*** Distilled from spider venom and the flora of the Underdark, poison can be found in abundance among the drow, and it plays an important part in their culture and politics. Drow mages concoct a viscid toxin that leaves enemies unconscious. Drow warriors coat their blades and crossbow bolts with this venom, looking forward to the interrogation and torture that follows combat.

> ##### Variant: Drow Magic Armor and Weapons
>Drow often wear magic armor and carry magic weapons that lose their enhancement bonuses permanently if they are exposed to sunlight for 1 hour or longer.
>
>- A drow wearing a +1 chain shirt and carrying a +1 shortsword has AC 16 and a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls with shortsword attacks.

>- A drow elite warrior wearing +2 studded leather and carrying a +2 shortsword has AC 20 and a +2 bonus on attack and damage rolls with shortsword attacks.
>- A drow priestess of Lolth wearing +3 scale mail has AC 19.

Its statistics, other than its size, are the same in each form. It can speak and cast spells while in spider form. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying in Humanoid form melds into the spider form. It can't activate, use, wield, or otherwise benefit from any of its equipment. It reverts to its Humanoid form if it dies.

## Drow Arachnomancer

Drow spellcasters who seek to devote themselves wholly to **Lolth**, the Spider Queen, sometimes walk the sinister path of the arachnomancer. By offering up body and soul to Lolth, they gain tremendous power and a supernatural connection to the ancient spiders of the Demonweb Pits, channeling magic from that dread place.

People do not fear drow assassins as much as they fear the drow scourges, due to the difference in notoriety. A lesser breed of killers would allow for a reputation of bloodshed to precede them, but drow assassins are not the most reputable humanoid killers of the Underdark, they are the deadliest. Little is known to others about these drow Occasionally, a noble will be found with their throat slit, or a party of adventurers will suddenly go missing. Drow assassins are not only careful in masking their handiwork, but will execute it with unheard of proficiency

Drow assassins were trained in the deepness of the underdark, under the tutelage of elite drow soldiers and mages. They can often come to the surface under their own motives or due to being contracted to dispatch a kill order. They are the best in the business when it comes to silence and discretion.Cutthroat Politics.Drow politics are cutthroat and rife with intrigue. When drow work together, it is typically to destroy a common foe and ensure their own survival, and such alliances are short lived and fraught with peril.

## Drow Diviner

[https://www.reddit.com/r/UnearthedArcana/comments/4qy9a9/drow_expansion_pack_dd_monsters_of_different/](Drow Diviner (The Man Claw Expansion Drow Pack))

Drow mages are often powerful in the arcane arts. However, many drow spell-weavers specialize in other forms of magic. Diviners are male drow who do not fit the bill for traditional mages, or female drow who wish to avoid the cutthroat power politics of drow society, but still seek to make a name for themselves with other magic. In many ways, they act similarly to priestesses of Lolth, but not wielding the same levels of power; personal or political. With these abilities, other drow seek out diviners as healers or what could pass for sages in their society. That said, diviners tend to have a few highly destructive magic tricks up their sleeves, just in case things do not go their way.

## Drow Elite Warrior

# Drow
Tens of thousands of years ago, the elves were divided, with those of benevolent disposition battling those that were selfish and cruel. The war among elvenkind ended when the good elves banished their malevolent kin to the subterranean depths. Here, in the lightless caverns and endless warrens of twisting passages, the dark elves-the drow-found refuge. They also found leadership in the only elven deity who had not forsaken them. At her command, the dark elves built an empire in the underworld.

***Children of Lolth.*** The drow worship Lolth, a deity who resides in the Abyss. Known as the Spider Queen or the Demon Queen of Spiders, she is the figure around which the dark elves have built their subterranean civilization. Whatever she demands, the drow do. The wickedest of elves, drow are seldom seen by the surface world. Though they plot to destroy the elves that banished them, they no longer see themselves as exiles. They are the destined rulers of the darkness, and when Lolth commands them to rise up and destroy their surface-dwelling kin, they will.

***Creatures of Darkness.*** The drow have lived underground for so long that they have evolved to their surroundings and can see in the dark. However, they can no longer stand sunlight. When slaves are in short supply in the Underdark, the drow send raiding parties to the surface to capture humanoids under cover of darkness, bringing them back to their cities to be tortured into submission. Beyond those occasional excursions, the drow are content to remain in their subterranean realm, where they feel secure and in control.

***Underdark Cities.*** The dark elves build fantastic cities in enormous caverns where food and water are abundant. Their ability to sculpt stone rivals that of the greatest dwarf artisans, yet their structures retain a decidedly elven aesthetic. Though appearing delicate, drow settlements are structurally sound and remarkably resilient. The drow like to hollow out enormous stalagmites and stalactites, creating populated spires that rise from the floors and ceilings. A drow city is a sprawling metropolis enclosed by high walls. Non-drow visitors must conduct their business outside the walls under watchful eyes. The drow raise and keep giant spiders to help protect their cities against intruders, even as they drape those cities in beautiful webbing, creating a gossamer snare to catch flying enemies that would otherwise soar over the walls.

***Drow Magic.*** Just as the drow have adapted to underground life, so too has their magic. In addition to using that magic to carve their cities from stone, they empower their weapons, create dangerous new magic items, and summon demons from the Abyss. Drow spellcasters are supremely arrogant and never hesitate to use their magic in the most abhorrent ways.

***Arms and Armor.*** Drow craft weapons made of adamantine, a dark and supernaturally hard metal. Drow artisans adorn their weapons and armor with web-like filigree and spider motifs, and mages sometimes imbue items with magic to enhance their effectiveness. However, such magic fades when exposed to sunlight, so that magical drow weapons and armor rarely retain their enhancement bonuses and magical properties when brought to the surface.

***Cutthroat Politics.*** Drow politics are cutthroat and rife with intrigue. When drow work together, it is typically to destroy a common foe and ensure their own survival, and such alliances are short lived and fraught with peril.

Drow society is divided into noble houses, each ruled by a matron who seeks to raise the prestige and power of her house above all others. Other high-ranking members of the house are blood relatives, while the middling ranks are flush with drow from weaker families that have sworn fealty to the greater house. Clinging precariously to the bottom rung of a house's social ladder are the house slaves, made up of drow of low birth and the occasional non-drow captive.

***Matriarchal Rule.*** Lolth, through her faithful priestesses, dictates the rules of drow society, ensuring that her orders and plots are carried out. Since Lolth is prone to manifesting on the Material Plane and directly punishing those that disobey her, the drow have learned to heed what she says and do as her priestesses command.

In drow society, males are subservient to females. A male drow might lead an Underdark patrol or a raiding party to the surface, but he reports to a female drow-either the matron of his house or one of her hand-picked female subordinates. Although male drow can fill almost any function in drow society, they can't be priests, nor can they rule a house.

***Poison Predilection.*** Distilled from spider venom and the flora of the Underdark, poison can be found in abundance among the drow, and it plays an important part in their culture and politics. Drow mages concoct a viscid toxin that leaves enemies unconscious. Drow warriors coat their blades and crossbow bolts with this venom, looking forward to the interrogation and torture that follows combat.

> ##### Variant: Drow Magic Armor and Weapons
>Drow often wear magic armor and carry magic weapons that lose their enhancement bonuses permanently if they are exposed to sunlight for 1 hour or longer.
>
>- A drow wearing a +1 chain shirt and carrying a +1 shortsword has AC 16 and a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls with shortsword attacks.

>- A drow elite warrior wearing +2 studded leather and carrying a +2 shortsword has AC 20 and a +2 bonus on attack and damage rolls with shortsword attacks.
>- A drow priestess of Lolth wearing +3 scale mail has AC 19.

## Drow Favored Consort

Nearly every priestess of **Lolth**, including the powerful **drow matron mother** in this book, takes an attractive drow as consort. Chosen as much for beauty as for magical might, a drow favored consort can hold their own in both conversation and combat. Combining the roles of advisor, protector, and beloved, some favored consorts are content with a supporting role, while more ambitious consorts aspire to be the power behind the throne—or even to claim the throne themselves.

Those favored consorts who prove their cunning gain the ear, and perhaps even the heart, of their priestess and are relied on to provide useful advice. No position of consort is assured for long, though; Lolth's priestesses are notoriously fickle, and a consort must often contend with rivals.

Some favored consorts work behind the scenes to undermine the evils encouraged by Lolth. Others can be found in Underdark cities free of Lolth's influence, where these powerful spellcasters apply their might toward ending her tyranny.

## Drow House Captain

*House captains will do anything to protect their family—whether that's their birth house or their platoon of scrappy rebels. I'd do anything for my (sometimes infuriating) mother and for my chosen family, so I admire their dedication.*— Tasha

A drow house captain leads the troops of an Underdark faction, whether defending a stronghold or leading forces against enemies. These officers make extensive study of strategy and tactics to become effective leaders in battle.

Among Lolth's devotees in the city of Menzoberranzan in the Forgotten Realms, each noble house entrusts the leadership of its military forces to a house captain, who is typically the first or second son of a drow matron mother. Elsewhere drow house captains fight in the war against Lolth, often allying with duergar and others who also wish to rid their subterranean world of that god's malevolence.

## Drow Inquisitor

Lolth's worshipers expect treachery—the Spider Queen encourages it, after all. A certain amount of backstabbing and double-crossing can be managed, but too much can undermine an entire community. To keep some semblance of order and to root out traitors, priestesses of Lolth employ inquisitors. Inquisitors are chosen from the ranks of the priesthood, and their authority is equaled only by that of the **drow matron mothers** (also in this book) of the noble houses. Anyone they decide is at odds with the hierarchy faces painful interrogation and usually an excruciating death.

## Drow Mage

# Drow
Tens of thousands of years ago, the elves were divided, with those of benevolent disposition battling those that were selfish and cruel. The war among elvenkind ended when the good elves banished their malevolent kin to the subterranean depths. Here, in the lightless caverns and endless warrens of twisting passages, the dark elves-the drow-found refuge. They also found leadership in the only elven deity who had not forsaken them. At her command, the dark elves built an empire in the underworld.

***Children of Lolth.*** The drow worship Lolth, a deity who resides in the Abyss. Known as the Spider Queen or the Demon Queen of Spiders, she is the figure around which the dark elves have built their subterranean civilization. Whatever she demands, the drow do. The wickedest of elves, drow are seldom seen by the surface world. Though they plot to destroy the elves that banished them, they no longer see themselves as exiles. They are the destined rulers of the darkness, and when Lolth commands them to rise up and destroy their surface-dwelling kin, they will.

***Creatures of Darkness.*** The drow have lived underground for so long that they have evolved to their surroundings and can see in the dark. However, they can no longer stand sunlight. When slaves are in short supply in the Underdark, the drow send raiding parties to the surface to capture humanoids under cover of darkness, bringing them back to their cities to be tortured into submission. Beyond those occasional excursions, the drow are content to remain in their subterranean realm, where they feel secure and in control.

***Underdark Cities.*** The dark elves build fantastic cities in enormous caverns where food and water are abundant. Their ability to sculpt stone rivals that of the greatest dwarf artisans, yet their structures retain a decidedly elven aesthetic. Though appearing delicate, drow settlements are structurally sound and remarkably resilient. The drow like to hollow out enormous stalagmites and stalactites, creating populated spires that rise from the floors and ceilings. A drow city is a sprawling metropolis enclosed by high walls. Non-drow visitors must conduct their business outside the walls under watchful eyes. The drow raise and keep giant spiders to help protect their cities against intruders, even as they drape those cities in beautiful webbing, creating a gossamer snare to catch flying enemies that would otherwise soar over the walls.

***Drow Magic.*** Just as the drow have adapted to underground life, so too has their magic. In addition to using that magic to carve their cities from stone, they empower their weapons, create dangerous new magic items, and summon demons from the Abyss. Drow spellcasters are supremely arrogant and never hesitate to use their magic in the most abhorrent ways.

***Arms and Armor.*** Drow craft weapons made of adamantine, a dark and supernaturally hard metal. Drow artisans adorn their weapons and armor with web-like filigree and spider motifs, and mages sometimes imbue items with magic to enhance their effectiveness. However, such magic fades when exposed to sunlight, so that magical drow weapons and armor rarely retain their enhancement bonuses and magical properties when brought to the surface.

***Cutthroat Politics.*** Drow politics are cutthroat and rife with intrigue. When drow work together, it is typically to destroy a common foe and ensure their own survival, and such alliances are short lived and fraught with peril.

Drow society is divided into noble houses, each ruled by a matron who seeks to raise the prestige and power of her house above all others. Other high-ranking members of the house are blood relatives, while the middling ranks are flush with drow from weaker families that have sworn fealty to the greater house. Clinging precariously to the bottom rung of a house's social ladder are the house slaves, made up of drow of low birth and the occasional non-drow captive.

***Matriarchal Rule.*** Lolth, through her faithful priestesses, dictates the rules of drow society, ensuring that her orders and plots are carried out. Since Lolth is prone to manifesting on the Material Plane and directly punishing those that disobey her, the drow have learned to heed what she says and do as her priestesses command.

In drow society, males are subservient to females. A male drow might lead an Underdark patrol or a raiding party to the surface, but he reports to a female drow-either the matron of his house or one of her hand-picked female subordinates. Although male drow can fill almost any function in drow society, they can't be priests, nor can they rule a house.

***Poison Predilection.*** Distilled from spider venom and the flora of the Underdark, poison can be found in abundance among the drow, and it plays an important part in their culture and politics. Drow mages concoct a viscid toxin that leaves enemies unconscious. Drow warriors coat their blades and crossbow bolts with this venom, looking forward to the interrogation and torture that follows combat.

> ##### Variant: Drow Magic Armor and Weapons
>Drow often wear magic armor and carry magic weapons that lose their enhancement bonuses permanently if they are exposed to sunlight for 1 hour or longer.
>
>- A drow wearing a +1 chain shirt and carrying a +1 shortsword has AC 16 and a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls with shortsword attacks.

>- A drow elite warrior wearing +2 studded leather and carrying a +2 shortsword has AC 20 and a +2 bonus on attack and damage rolls with shortsword attacks.
>- A drow priestess of Lolth wearing +3 scale mail has AC 19.

## Drow Matron Mother

Among drow followers of **Lolth**, each noble house is led by a matron mother, an influential priestess of Lolth charged with carrying out the god's will while also advancing the interests of the family. Matron mothers embody the scheming and treachery associated with the Queen of Spiders. Each stands at the center of a vast conspiratorial web, with demons, spiders, and conscripted soldiers positioned between them and their enemies. Although matron mothers command great power, that power depends on maintaining the Spider Queen's favor, and the goddess sometimes capriciously takes back what she has given. The stat block here represents a matron mother at the height of her power.

A matron mother is almost never encountered alone. She is typically accompanied by a **drow favored consort** and a **drow house captain**, each of whom appears in this book. Other Underdark creatures might also be in the priestess's presence, providing protection or advice.

### Mothers of Rebellion
Some matron mothers renounce **Lolth** and join the war against their former goddess. Such drow could be of any alignment, and they lose the following abilities in the stat block: Lolth's Fickle Favor, Summon Servant, and Compel Demon. Even without these abilities, drow matron mothers are formidable opponents, and several of them hold positions of great influence in the Underdark armies arrayed against the followers of Lolth.

### A Matron Mother's Lair
The palace of a drow matron mother is her home and fortress. Sigils throughout the building allow the matron mother to use the following lair actions while within it.

Any temple of **Lolth** also functions as a matron mother's lair while she is inside it, unless she has renounced Lolth or another matron mother is present. When two or more matron mothers gather within a temple of their goddess, none of them can use it as their lair.

#### Lair Actions
On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the drow can take one of the following lair actions when in her lair; she can't take the same lair action two rounds in a row:

- **Perceive Interlopers** The drow projects her mind throughout her lair, marking any potential threats against her or her retinue. Until initiative count 20 of the next round, hostile creatures within the lair can't become hidden from her and gain no benefit from the invisible condition against her.
- **Spectral Web** A glistening spectral spider web erupts from a point the drow can see within 120 feet of her. Each creature within 60 feet of that point must succeed a DC 19 Dexterity saving throw or be restrained for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
- **Telekinetic Throw** The drow targets one creature she can see within 60 feet of her and attempts to expel it from her presence. The target must succeed on a DC 19 Strength saving throw or be flung 2d6 × 10 feet through the air. A creature smashed into a solid object takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet moved. If released in midair, the creature takes falling damage as normal.

## Drow Novice Mage

[https://www.reddit.com/r/UnearthedArcana/comments/4qy9a9/drow_expansion_pack_dd_monsters_of_different/](Drow Novice Mage (The Man Claw Expansion Drow Pack))

One of the reasons drow mages are so powerful is that they have several human lifetimes to study magic. Gaining true mastery of magic for most drow mages takes a long time. It can be difficult for a drow mage to find a master because, in the true unforgiving spirit of drow society, a master might see a student as a threat to his own power or life. As such, an aspiring drow mage will spend decades working to forge (usually) his own fate

## Drow Priestess of Lolth

Female drow with blood ties to a noble house are molded and trained from birth to become priestesses of Lolth. The Spider Queen doesn't allow male drow to hold such positions.

Such priestesses execute the will of the Spider Queen, and as a result, they wield tremendous power and influence in drow society. The matron mothers who rule the drow houses are the most powerful of Lolth's priestesses, but they must constantly balance their devotion to the Spider Queen with their devotion to their families.

# Drow
Tens of thousands of years ago, the elves were divided, with those of benevolent disposition battling those that were selfish and cruel. The war among elvenkind ended when the good elves banished their malevolent kin to the subterranean depths. Here, in the lightless caverns and endless warrens of twisting passages, the dark elves-the drow-found refuge. They also found leadership in the only elven deity who had not forsaken them. At her command, the dark elves built an empire in the underworld.

***Children of Lolth.*** The drow worship Lolth, a deity who resides in the Abyss. Known as the Spider Queen or the Demon Queen of Spiders, she is the figure around which the dark elves have built their subterranean civilization. Whatever she demands, the drow do. The wickedest of elves, drow are seldom seen by the surface world. Though they plot to destroy the elves that banished them, they no longer see themselves as exiles. They are the destined rulers of the darkness, and when Lolth commands them to rise up and destroy their surface-dwelling kin, they will.

***Creatures of Darkness.*** The drow have lived underground for so long that they have evolved to their surroundings and can see in the dark. However, they can no longer stand sunlight. When slaves are in short supply in the Underdark, the drow send raiding parties to the surface to capture humanoids under cover of darkness, bringing them back to their cities to be tortured into submission. Beyond those occasional excursions, the drow are content to remain in their subterranean realm, where they feel secure and in control.

***Underdark Cities.*** The dark elves build fantastic cities in enormous caverns where food and water are abundant. Their ability to sculpt stone rivals that of the greatest dwarf artisans, yet their structures retain a decidedly elven aesthetic. Though appearing delicate, drow settlements are structurally sound and remarkably resilient. The drow like to hollow out enormous stalagmites and stalactites, creating populated spires that rise from the floors and ceilings. A drow city is a sprawling metropolis enclosed by high walls. Non-drow visitors must conduct their business outside the walls under watchful eyes. The drow raise and keep giant spiders to help protect their cities against intruders, even as they drape those cities in beautiful webbing, creating a gossamer snare to catch flying enemies that would otherwise soar over the walls.

***Drow Magic.*** Just as the drow have adapted to underground life, so too has their magic. In addition to using that magic to carve their cities from stone, they empower their weapons, create dangerous new magic items, and summon demons from the Abyss. Drow spellcasters are supremely arrogant and never hesitate to use their magic in the most abhorrent ways.

***Arms and Armor.*** Drow craft weapons made of adamantine, a dark and supernaturally hard metal. Drow artisans adorn their weapons and armor with web-like filigree and spider motifs, and mages sometimes imbue items with magic to enhance their effectiveness. However, such magic fades when exposed to sunlight, so that magical drow weapons and armor rarely retain their enhancement bonuses and magical properties when brought to the surface.

***Cutthroat Politics.*** Drow politics are cutthroat and rife with intrigue. When drow work together, it is typically to destroy a common foe and ensure their own survival, and such alliances are short lived and fraught with peril.

Drow society is divided into noble houses, each ruled by a matron who seeks to raise the prestige and power of her house above all others. Other high-ranking members of the house are blood relatives, while the middling ranks are flush with drow from weaker families that have sworn fealty to the greater house. Clinging precariously to the bottom rung of a house's social ladder are the house slaves, made up of drow of low birth and the occasional non-drow captive.

***Matriarchal Rule.*** Lolth, through her faithful priestesses, dictates the rules of drow society, ensuring that her orders and plots are carried out. Since Lolth is prone to manifesting on the Material Plane and directly punishing those that disobey her, the drow have learned to heed what she says and do as her priestesses command.

In drow society, males are subservient to females. A male drow might lead an Underdark patrol or a raiding party to the surface, but he reports to a female drow-either the matron of his house or one of her hand-picked female subordinates. Although male drow can fill almost any function in drow society, they can't be priests, nor can they rule a house.

***Poison Predilection.*** Distilled from spider venom and the flora of the Underdark, poison can be found in abundance among the drow, and it plays an important part in their culture and politics. Drow mages concoct a viscid toxin that leaves enemies unconscious. Drow warriors coat their blades and crossbow bolts with this venom, looking forward to the interrogation and torture that follows combat.

> ##### Variant: Drow Magic Armor and Weapons
>Drow often wear magic armor and carry magic weapons that lose their enhancement bonuses permanently if they are exposed to sunlight for 1 hour or longer.
>
>- A drow wearing a +1 chain shirt and carrying a +1 shortsword has AC 16 and a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls with shortsword attacks.
>- A drow elite warrior wearing +2 studded leather and carrying a +2 shortsword has AC 20 and a +2 bonus on attack and damage rolls with shortsword attacks.
>- A drow priestess of Lolth wearing +3 scale mail has AC 19.

One of the reasons the drow have garnered so much animosity is the raids they launch on the surface, plundering settlements for riches, and taking some of those who survive the slaughter and rape as slaves.The raiders who carry out these acts are not only cold-hearted individuals, but also warriors fierce enough to destroy local resistance.VARIANT: CR 1 DROW RAIDERSIf slightly less powerful drow fighters better suit you game, their Challenge Rating can easily be reduced1 by doing the following: Lower their hit points to 3 remove their shields (reducing their AC to 15), andtake away the poison damage done with their shortdwords.

Whether it is between rival drow, or against 'lesser' races, there is always use for drow who are cunning, discrete, and deadly. Drow rogues employs their skills as spies, saboteurs, hit men, or lone wolves. Underestimating them often proves deadly.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/UnearthedArcana/comments/4qy9a9/drow_expansion_pack_dd_monsters_of_different/](Drow Scourge (The Man Claw Expansion Drow Pack))

Merely invoking the name of the drow scourge will cause many an otherwise brave warrior to feel a chill through their spine. Scourges are the most deadly class of drow warriors. They serve as guards for royalty but, more commonly, as a strike force that one uses to not only destroy their target, but also make a statement with the sheer brutality of the attack. Scourges operate without mercy or remorse, laying waste to all those who stand in their way.

## Drow Shadowblade

Drow shadowblades steal down the dim passages of the Underdark, bound on errands of mayhem. They protect enclaves and Underdark cities from enemies and track down thieves who make off with prized treasures. In the city of Menzoberranzan in the Forgotten Realms, noble houses often employ shadowblades to eliminate rivals from other houses. In communities free of Lolth's sway, they serve as spies tasked with foiling the plots of that demon lord's cult. In any role they take on, they move undetected until the moment they attack—and then they are the last thing their victims see.

A shadowblade gains their powers over shadow via a ritual in which they kill a shadow demon and mystically prevent it from re-forming in the Abyss, siphoning its essence into themselves.

## Drow Stalker

[https://www.reddit.com/r/UnearthedArcana/comments/4qy9a9/drow_expansion_pack_dd_monsters_of_different/](Drow Stalker (The Man Claw Expansion Drow Pack))

Drow Stalkers are expert hunters of sentient prey. They attack unseen, and by the time their enemies know what is happening, it is already too late, as they are hit with a barrage of poisonous arrows and flurry of blades from shadows in all directions. In the rare event that an enemy manages to flee, they are quickly overtaken by the skilled trackers, only to realize their fate is inescapable.
