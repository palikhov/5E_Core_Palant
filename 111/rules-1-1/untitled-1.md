##  Core Mechanic

When a player declares an action – which includes a desired outcome and an approach anticipated to bring about that action – the GM determines the outcome and describes the result. First, the GM determines whether there is a chance that the action might succeed and a chance that the action might fail. If the GM determines the action can’t succeed, the action is a failure, though the GM may warn the player of the impossibility of the action instead. If the GM determines the action can’t fail, the action is a success. If the GM determines that the action can fail, but there is no risk or cost for failure such that the player can keep trying until they succeed, the action is a success. Otherwise, the GM uses the Core Mechanic to determine the outcome.

Under the Core Mechanic, based on the approach the player is using, the GM determines which Ability \(Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma\) governs the action. The GM also determines an appropriate Difficulty Class for the action. The GM – possibly with help from the player – determines whether the character has a relevant Proficiency. The GM also determines any circumstantial Modifiers. Modifiers can include a static bonus or penalty or the roll can be made with Advantage or Disadvantage.

Once all of that has been determined, the player rolls 1d20 and adds the relevant Ability Modifier, Bonuses and Penalties, and their Proficiency Bonus \(if relevant\). If the total equals or exceeds the chosen Difficulty Class, the action succeeds. If not, the action fails. If the roll is made with Advantage, the player rolls 2d20 and uses the highest single die roll. If the roll is made with Disadvantage, the player rolls 2d20 and uses the lowest single die roll.

If an action succeeds, the player either accomplishes their desired outcome or makes progress toward that outcome. If the action fails, the player does not accomplish their desired outcome and may suffer costs or risks associated with the roll. Regardless of the success or failure of the action, the GM may also apply consequences based on the player’s approach. The GM describes the results and applies any necessary consequences. Then play continues.

## The Reaction Rule. 

A GM can use the Reaction Rule whenever a character has a moment to respond to something unexpected. The GM describes what the character is aware of. The player then describes their reaction. The GM then determines if the reaction could avoid or mitigate the unexpected event, whether it can succeed, and whether it can fail. The GM then asks for a Saving Throw or Ability Check based on the action. Any spell that can be cast as a Reaction can be used in this instance.

### Example

Example: A player has stepped on a pressure plate that will trigger a trap-door opening underneath the forward rank members of the party, Alice and Bob. The GM tells the party “Alice, as your foot hits the ground, you feel a tile give way and hear an audible click. You’ve triggered a pressure plate. What do you do?” Alice, not knowing what is coming, says “I tumble forwards, trying to roll out of the way.” Bob, also unaware of what is coming, says “I raise my shield and stand my ground, gritting my teeth and trying to absorb whatever is about to hit me.” The GM determines that Alice’s action could conceivably carry her forward away from the pit trap. He asks her to make a Dexterity Saving Throw. Bob’s action, however, won’t do him any good. He plunges into the pit.

Example: Carol is trying to sneak past a patrolling goblin to steal a valuable thing. The goblin is walking ahead of her and she’s creeping silently behind, several feet back. Unbeknownst to Carol, she has failed her stealth check and the goblin is about to turn around because he thought he heard her breathing. “Suddenly, the goblin freezes. He’s about to turn, what do you do?” Carol thinks for a minute. “Is the cave wall irregular enough? Can I hide in the folds and crevices?” The GM says, “You could, but you’ll have Disadvantage since you have to move fast.” Carol thinks and says, “I’ll whip my dagger and try to take out the goblin before he turns.” The GM says “okay, give me a ranged attack roll with Advantage since the goblin is currently unaware of you.  


## Passive Proficiencies as Knowledge. 

All Proficiencies \(skills, tools, weapons, and armor\) are assumed to represent both active uses of those things and relevant background knowledge, lore, information, and awareness. When a player with a Proficiency encounters something in the game, the GM should simply give them any relevant information based on their expertise. The GM is advised to gate information based on skill proficiencies in the flavor text and descriptions of items and monsters. In addition, advanced knowledge may be gated behind specific levels of knowledge. A character’s Passive Skill is equal to 8 + Ability Modifier + Proficiency Bonus. If the character has Advantage on such skill checks, the Passive Skill gains an additional +5. If the character has Disadvantage, the character suffers an additional -5. Any bonus that can be granted to a skill roll, such as from Bardic Inspiration or from a Cleric’s bless spell may also be applied to Passive Skills.  


## Opposed Rolls. 

When a character attempts an action that puts it in direct opposition with another character’s skills or proficiencies, the DC for the character’s action is 8 + target’s Ability Modifier + target’s Proficiency Bonus for the relevant skill. If the target has Advantage or Disadvantage on the skill, apply +5 or -5 to the DC. Any bonus that can be granted to the target’s skill roll, such as from Bardic Inspiration or from a Cleric’s bless spell may also be applied to the DC. The notation for this is an Ability \(Skill\) Check vs. Ability \(Skill\). E.g.: Roll a Dexterity \(Stealth\) check vs. the scout’s Wisdom \(Perception\).  


## Working Together. 

When two or more characters work together to accomplish the same task, the character with the higher modifier leads the effort. The leader makes the appropriate ability check and enjoys a +2 bonus for one or two helpers or a +5 bonus for three or more helpers. Characters can only work together if it is task where such help is feasible and possible. In addition, a character can only help with a task if they would not be incapable of attempting the task on their own \(due to a lack of Proficiency for instance\).  


## Group Checks. 

When several PCs are trying to accomplish something as a group, the GM can call for a group check. First, the GM determines whether the group will succeed if any member succeeds \(such as with searching\) or if the group will fail if any member fails \(such as with stealth\). In the first scenario, the character with the highest base Ability Check modifier \(Proficiency Bonus + Ability Bonus\) rolls the check. In the second scenario, the character with the lowest base Ability Check modifier \(Proficiency Bonus + Ability Bonus\) rolls the check. Bonuses, penalties, Advantage, and Disadvantage are applied normally to the character rolling the check, but these should only be applied after the GM has determined which player has rolled the check.  


## Group Checks.

When several PCs are trying to accomplish something as a group, the GM can call for a group check. First, the GM determines whether the group will succeed **if any member succeeds** \(such as with searching\) or if the group will fail **if any member fails \(**such as with stealth\). \

In the first scenario, the group rolls a single check using the highest ability check modifier and proficiency bonus available to any single character. If any member of the group would have advantage on the check, the check is made with advantage. If any member of the group is benefiting from any bonuses that would apply to the check, the best single one of those bonuses is also applied to the check.

In the second scenario, the group rolls a single check using the lowest ability check modifier and proficiency bonus available to any single character. If any member of the group would have disadvantage on the check, the check is made with disadvantage. If any member of the group is suffering from any penalties that would affect the check, the single worst one of those penalties is also applied to the check.

When a player declares an action, it is important to distinguish between an immediate action and one that will take a few minutes. Kicking open a door or jumping over a pit are immediate actions. Securing a rope and climbing down one side of a pit and up the other is a task that will take a few minutes. As is picking a lock. Any action that will take more than one minute but less than ten minutes should be considered an exploration task.\

### Actions During Exploration

As is normal, once a player declares an action, the GM determines whether the action can succeed or fail and determines whether an ability check is required. The GM should also determine whether the action is immediate and also whether the action is quiet or noisy. If the description of the action doesn’t make that obvious, the GM should ask questions of the player to determine those answers.

If the action is immediate, the action can be resolved immediately. If the action was loud, the GM Rolls for Complications \(see below\).

If the action is not immediate, however, the GM should let the other players know that the character is engaged in an action that will take a few minutes and ask what the other players are doing during this time. This should be done before the non-immediate action is resolved. If any players undertake immediate actions at this point or ask questions, they should be dealt with immediately. If any players declare actions that aren’t immediate, those actions should be held. Once all the players are committed to non-immediate actions or to waiting for their allies to finish their tasks, the GM should resolve each non-immediate task in turn and then Advance Time \(see below\). If any of the actions were loud, the GM should Roll for Complications \(see below\).

Example: The party enters an ancient study. There is a book chained to a lectern in the middle of the room, an ancient desk, and a bookshelf filled with aging books. Unbeknownst to the party, there is also a strongbox sitting on the floor behind the desk. Any player in the vicinity of the desk will notice it immediately. Alice says, “I want to go check out that book on the lectern.” The GM explains that it is a leather-bound book, aged, but intact. The cover has a padlock, locking it closed, and it is secured via a chain to the lectern. Alice wants to investigate the book further. The GM asks what she means. She says she suspects the book might be protected by a trap of some kind. She’d like to be sure it’s safe before she tries to unlock it. The GM says “that will take several minutes, okay? While Alice is doing that, what do the rest of you do?” Bob says he’d like to go over an examine the desk. The GM says “as you approach the desk, you notice a metal strong-box on the floor beside it. It is closed with a padlock.” Bob says “I want to try to pry open the padlock with my crowbar.” The GM nods and says “that will also take a few minutes. You can do that while Alice is looking for traps.” Carol says, “I’m just going to keep watch.” Dave says, “I’ll go look through the books on the bookshelf. I’ll see if I can find anything valuable or unusual.” Now that Alice, Bob, and Dave are committed to non-immediate actions and Carol is waiting for them to finish, the GM can resolve each action in turn. The GM determines that none of the actions are loud. The GM Advances Time and then resolves each of the actions in turn. And then asks the party what they want to do next.

### Extended Tasks

In general, an exploration task should take no longer than ten minutes. However, some very complicated tasks can take an extended period of time. The GM can determine, for example, that an extremely complex, ancient lock might take longer to pick. During that time, the party might attract attention and complications may arise.

When designing an extended task, a GM should determine how much time the task requires in terms of actions. Each action Advances Time \(see below\) once and, if the action is noisy, may cause a Roll for Complications \(see below\). Obviously, during this time, other characters may engage in actions as described above or they can simply wait. If the action does not require a die roll, the GM merely Advances Time for each required action and, if necessary, Rolls for Complications. If the action does require a die roll, the GM Advances Time and Rolls for Complications for each action as normal, but if the die roll is a failure, the character makes no progress. Thus, they may have to attempt further actions in order to complete the task. Of course, if the action takes too long, the party may decide to give up. Particularly if complications arise.

**This drastically alters the DM calculus from the Five Rules for Dating My Teenaged Skill System. Specifically, it moves a whole bunch of actions that were previously automatic successes or failures under Rules \#2 and \#3 into extended tests with a ticking clock under \#3a. That brings this way closer to the RPG orthodoxy where you roll for everything. Now, only immediate actions would be automatically resolved under the Five Rules, because there is always a ticking clock for non-immediate actions, so each segment of time requires an additional roll.**  


## Getting the Lay of the Land

As a time-consuming action, you can wander the local area and get a sense of what’s around you. The GM will describe the area and note interesting features that might represent opportunities, threats, and mysteries. You might be asked to make skill or ability checks to discover non-obvious features.

In a **village**, **stronghold**, or **enclave**, you can explore the entire locale and its outskirts in one go. You can explore either a **town proper** or its **outskirts**. Or you can explore a single **neighborhood**, **district**, **ward**, or **complex** in a city. In civilized locales, you might also hear about local rumors or happenings in passing \(but see Gathering Information below\).

In the wilderness, the size of the area you can explore depends on the terrain, visibility, and other factors. You can improve your odds of turning things up by taking advantage of high vantage points, spyglasses, familiars, spells, magical items, and other tools and resources. Because exploring involves crisscrossing a small area, you cannot cover any traveling distance while exploring.  


## Gathering Information

As a time-consuming action, you can seek information from the locals in a village, stronghold, enclave, town, neighborhood, or complex or a specific location therein such as an inn, market, guildhall, or academy. The more specific you are about the information you are seeking, the more likely you are to find what you are looking for. Or find out that it’s not available. Smaller locations are easier to canvas but the information you’re seeking may not be available at all types of locations. You might be asked to make a skill or ability check to determine whether your efforts are successful, and you might be asked to pay bribes, finders fees, buy drinks, or otherwise sacrifice some money before you can roll or to improve your odds. If you’re successful, the GM will either provide you with the information you’re seeking or provide you with a lead that you can pursue to acquire the information.

Instead of seeking specific information, you can also **eavesdrop**, **gossip**, and **chatter** with the locals. The GM will provide you with several rumors and happenings that might represent opportunities, threats, and mysteries to pursue. This is similar to Getting the Lay of Land, but reveals informational leads rather than locations \(see Getting the Lay of the Lay above\).
