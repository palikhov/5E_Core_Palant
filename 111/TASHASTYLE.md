# Using This Book
}}

*Tasha's Cauldron of Ever Single Thing* offers a host of new looks for DUNGEONS & DRAGONS content, and our journey through those options is accompanied by the notes of the wizard Tasha. Creator of the spell *Tasha's hideous laughter*, Tasha's life is one of the most storied in the D&D multiverse. Raised by Baba Yaga, the Mother of Witches herself, Tasha adventured across the world of Greyhawk and became the friend and sometimes enemy of other famous adventurers, like Mordenkainen. In time, she ruled as the Witch Queen and later changed her name to Iggwilv—a figure of legend who is whispered about, feared, and admired.


{{comment,signature,long
My dear, sweet, lucky reader,

This is a long-form note from Tasha (or whomever you'd like to sign the note). It has a slightly different appearance and size rules than the short note. 

Make sure to differentiate between the two, because long notes will probably only look good if it takes up half the page or more. 

Lastly, the last paragraph inside the note will be considered the signature. The text of the signature will appear slightly larger and will be right-aligned.

{{comment,signature
These short notes, however, are great for 1 or 2 lines of text. And a snarky comment, of course.

Also, you can omit Tasha's symbol if you want, just add the "noicon" class to the comment.

## Chapter 1
# Character Options
}}

When you make your D&D character, you have an array of options in the *Player's Handbook* to create the sort of adventurer you want. This chapter adds to those options, making it possible to realize even more character concepts. If you combine these options with those in *Xanathar's Guide to Everything*, the possibilities for your characters become vast.

Here are the options featured in this chapter:
- A way to customize your character's origin by changing some of your racial traits
- Guidance on changing your subclass
- The artificer class, a master of magical invention
- Class features and subclasses for every class in the *Player's Handbook*
- Feats for anyone who uses that optional rule

## Chapter 2
# Group Patrons
}}

Each adventuring group is bound together by the quests it embarks on and by the dangers its members face together. This chapter offers another way to bind your party together: a group patron. These patrons provide a strong binding element: an individual or an organization that unites a party as a team in service to a greater purpose. A group patron can help set the tone of your party's entire campaign. For example, a group whose patron is an academic institution is likely to have a very different story from a group that serves a military. A patron can influence characters' relationships, their backstories, and the types of dangers they face.
